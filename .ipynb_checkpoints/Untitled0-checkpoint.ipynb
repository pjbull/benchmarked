[Pet. App. 29] TSAC is a governmental corporation created by the Tennessee legislature to administer student assistance programs authorized by law to guarantee student loans under the provisions of the federal Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. TENN.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nCODE ANN. \\xa7\\xa7 49-4-201, et seq.; TENN. CODE ANN. \\xa7 49-4- 401.\\n\\nOn February 26, 1999, the Debtor filed a \\u201cno asset\\u201d Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Tennessee, Western Division. [Pet. App. 29] Sallie Mae Service, Inc. (\\u201cSallie Mae\\u201d), submitted a proof of claim to the bankruptcy court, which it subsequently assigned to the State. However, the State did not itself ever file a proof of claim in the bankruptcy case. [Pet. App. 6, 29]\\n\\nThe Debtor received her general discharge on June 4, 1999, without addressing her student loans. She subsequently reopened the case on September 14, 1999, and on October 14, 1999, she filed a complaint seeking a hardship discharge under 11 U.S.C. \\xa7 523(a)(8), naming the United States of America, its Department of Education and Sallie Mae, as defendants. On February 22, 2000, the Debtor amended the complaint to add TSAC as a defendant. At the time she filed the complaint, the Debtor owed the State $4,169.31. [Pet. App. 29-30, Joint App. 9]\\n\\nThe State moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the bankruptcy court did not have jurisdiction over TSAC based on its sovereign immunity as a state agency. Following a hearing, the bankruptcy court denied the State\\u2019s motion. The bankruptcy court found that TSAC was a state agency entitled to assert the protection of sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment, but that Congress validly abrogated that immunity when it enacted 11 U.S.C. \\xa7 106(a). The bankruptcy court based its decision on both the presumption of constitutionality of the statute and on the need for uniformity in application of the bankruptcy laws. [Pet. App. 65, 79-80]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\nThe State appealed to the United States Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\\u201cBAP\\u201d) for the Sixth Circuit, which affirmed the bankruptcy court\\u2019s decision. The BAP decided that this Court\\u2019s decisions in Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996), and its progeny did not compel the conclusion that the States enjoyed sovereign immunity in the bankruptcy context both because none of those cases specifically involved bankruptcy and because none of the laws at issue in those cases were enacted under a clause with a uniformity requirement like that in the Bankruptcy Clause. [Pet. App. 55-59] The panel concluded that the States ceded their sovereignty over the bankruptcy discharge as a part of the plan of the Constitutional Convention and that, where there is no sovereignty, there can be no sovereign immunity. [Pet. App. 60]\\n\\nOn the State\\u2019s appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the decision for essentially the same reasons as stated by the BAP. The court ruled that Congress validly abrogated the States\\u2019 sovereign immunity through the exercise of its power under the Bankruptcy Clause, U.S. CONST. art. I, \\xa7 8, cl. 4, because the States, in ratifying that provision, had already agreed to surrender their immunity with respect to bankruptcy laws. [Pet. App. 17-21]\\n\\nIn reaching this decision, which essentially followed without citing the rationale of the dissent in Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234 (1985), and the plurality of Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U.S. 1 (1989), the court relied on its own interpretation of The Federalist Papers, notably Nos. 32 and 81 (Alexander Hamilton). Although noting that this Court had relied heavily on Federalist No. 81 in Seminole Tribe, the court of appeals apparently concluded that this Court had overlooked a key portion of Federalist No. 81, and its relationship to\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\nFederalist No. 32. Based on its reading of those two essays, the court found that there was \\u201cno other\\u201d conclusion than that there had been a waiver of the States\\u2019 immunity \\u201cin the plan of the convention\\u201d with respect to bankruptcy cases when the States granted Congress power to make uniform laws on the subject. [Pet. App. 19]\\n\\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 --------------------------------- SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT The decision in this case is squarely controlled by this Court\\u2019s decision in Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996), which held that Congress could not use any Article I power to create private rights of action to enforce legislation enacted under those powers. Both the majority and the dissent in Seminole Tribe specifically referred to bankruptcy as an Article I power that would be subject to the holdings in the case. Id. at 73 n.16 and at 77 n.1 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\\n\\nThe court below refused to follow that precedent, relying on a single paragraph in The Federalist Papers that it concluded could only be interpreted as meaning that the States had fully ceded their sovereign immunity with respect to bankruptcy at the time they ratified the Constitution. That argument, however, contrary to the Sixth Circuit\\u2019s view, was not newly discovered, has already been presented to this Court in great detail, and was not accepted when first raised almost twenty years ago. Moreover, even if the Court were writing on a blank slate, the Sixth Circuit\\u2019s analysis is logically and factually unsupportable.\\n\\nThe court below\\u2019s rejection of the supporting evidence proffered by the State with respect to the understanding of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nthe Constitution during the ratification debates stands the method of analysis used by this Court for more than a hundred years, since Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1 (1890), on its head. Requiring the State to show affirmatively that bankruptcy was specifically raised during the debates, rather than placing the burden on the private party to show that private suits in bankruptcy cases were not \\u201canomalous and unheard of \\u201d at the time of the Constitution (Id. at 18) reverses the method of analysis that this Court has adopted. And, in any event, the available evidence does show that there was no established pattern of federally-authorized suits against States much less \\u201ccompelling evidence\\u201d that such suits existed as required by Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U.S. 775, 781 (1991). To the contrary, no bankruptcy laws before 1978 (including during the pre-Revolutionary period under English law) even attempted to abrogate state immunity or to challenge the Eleventh Amendment\\u2019s application to bankruptcy. As such, the present language in 11 U.S.C. \\xa7 106(a) plainly attempts to authorize the type of \\u201canomalous\\u201d proceedings that this Court has repeatedly barred.\\n\\nFinally, there are no other reasons for distinguishing the Bankruptcy Code from other Article I powers or for refusing to apply this Court\\u2019s existing immunity jurisprudence. Accordingly, the State respectfully requests that the decision below be reversed, and the Debtor \\u2019s complaint against the State in bankruptcy court be dismissed.\\n\\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\nARGUMENT I. CONGRESS DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO ABROGATE STATE IMMUNITY WITH RESPECT TO BANKRUPTCY. A. Article I Does Not Give Congress the Power to Abrogate State Sovereign Immunity. The powers allocated to Congress by Article I of the Constitution to legislate on the topics specified therein do not include the power to create private rights of action against unconsenting States to enforce those laws and powers, or to delegate the power of the United States to enforce those laws against the State. This is based in part on the literal words of the Eleventh Amendment. Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 54. More fundamentally, though, the States\\u2019 immunity from private-party suits is based on the precepts that \\u201ceach State is a sovereign entity in our federal system,\\u201d and that \\u201c[i]t is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent.\\u201d Id.; Hans, 134 U.S. at 13; FEDERALIST No. 81, at 548 (Alexander Hamilton) (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (emphasis in original). That principle of retained state sovereign immunity, as precedent to the Eleventh Amendment and a core component of the fundamental constitutional structure, was first announced in Hans, 134 U.S. at 13, and has been the foundation of this Court\\u2019s jurisprudence on sovereign immunity ever since. Suits by a State\\u2019s own citizens are barred, despite the literal terms of the Eleventh Amendment, \\u201cbecause of the fundamental rule of which the amendment is but an exemplification.\\u201d In re New York, 256 U.S. 490, 497 (1921).\\n\\nfundamentally immunity Because retained state limits both Article I and Article III, Congress may not use\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nits Article I powers to abolish that immunity, regardless of the breadth of those powers.\\n\\n[T]he background principle of state sovereign immunity embodied in the Eleventh Amendment is not so ephemeral as to dissipate when the subject of the suit is an area, like the regulation of Indian commerce, that is under the exclusive control of the Federal Government. Even when the Constitution vests in Congress complete lawmaking authority over a particular area, the Eleventh Amendment prevents congressional authorization of suits by private parties against unconsenting States. The Eleventh Amendment restricts the judicial power under Article III, and Article I cannot be used to circumvent the constitutional limitations placed upon federal jurisdiction.\\n\\nSeminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 72-73.\\n\\nBy confirming that state sovereign immunity remains intact even where the Constitution grants the Federal Government \\u201cexclusive control\\u201d and \\u201ccomplete lawmaking authority,\\u201d the Court made clear that legislative authority, on the one hand, and immunity from private-party suits, on the other hand, are distinct rights of sovereignty. To cede the former is not to yield the latter.\\n\\nThe Constitution, by delegating to Congress the power to establish the supreme law of the land when acting within its enumerated powers, does not foreclose a State from asserting immunity to claims arising under federal law merely because that law derives not from the State itself but from the national power. . . . We reject any contention that substantive federal law by its own\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\nforce necessarily overrides the sovereign immunity of the States.\\n\\nAlden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 732 (1999).\\n\\nSince Seminole Tribe, the Court has emphasized in increasingly unequivocal and unambiguous terms that none of Congress\\u2019 Article I powers, however \\u201cexclusive\\u201d or \\u201ccomplete,\\u201d and specifically including the Bankruptcy Clause, authorize abrogation of the States\\u2019 immunity from private-party suits. See Seminole Tribe, at 72-73 n.16 and at 77 n.1 (Stevens, J., dissenting). In Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 80 (2000), the Court held that \\u201cCongress\\u2019 powers under Article I of the Constitution do not include the power to subject States to suit at the hands of private individuals\\u201d in a suit under the ADEA, which was enacted under the Commerce Clause.

Seminole Tribe involved an exercise of congressional power under the Indian Commerce Clause, which is perhaps the \\u201cmost plenary\\u201d federal power in the Constitution, in that\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nthe Indian Commerce Clause divests the States of \\u201cvirtually all authority over Indian commerce,\\u201d while under the Interstate Commerce Clause States may still exercise some authority. Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 62. The Court overruled its short-lived decision in Union Gas, 491 U.S. 1 (which had found congressional power to abrogate under the Interstate Commerce Clause) and held that Congress could not abrogate state immunity even under the ultraplenary Indian Commerce Clause power. Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 66. Necessarily, any Article I power (such as bankruptcy) that gives Congress no broader powers can have no greater effect on state immunity.\\n\\n\\n\\n1.

Camps Newfound, 520 U.S. at 571; Hughes, 441 U.S. at 326; West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U.S. 186, 193 n.9 (1994). Madison wrote that the Commerce Clause \\u201cwas intended as a negative and preventive provision against injustice among the States themselves, rather than as a power to be used for the positive purposes of the General Government.\\u201d 3 M. FARRAND, RECORDS OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION OF 1787, p. 478 (1911).\\n\\n\\n\\n2. The Bankruptcy Clause gives Congress no greater power than the Commerce Clause, and is equally controlled by Seminole Tribe. Compared to the broad scope of Commerce Clause power, the significance of the Bankruptcy Clause was far more limited. While the need for federal power over interstate commerce was one of the main issues giving rise\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\nto the Constitutional Convention, the subject of bankruptcy only arose after the Convention had been in session for three months, and some two weeks before it ended. On August 29, 1787, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina proposed to add to the Full Faith and Credit Clause, a provision allowing Congress \\u201c[t]o establish uniform laws upon the subject of bankruptcies, and respecting the damages arising on the protest of foreign bills of exchange.\\u201d NOTES OF DEBATES IN THE FEDERAL CONVENTION OF 1787 REPORTED BY JAMES MADISON, p. 546 (A. Koch ed. 1987). The bankruptcy language was approved a few days later with little discussion, and with only a single dissenting vote. Id. at 569, 571. Such is the entire recorded history of discussion of bankruptcy at the Convention.\\n\\nSimilarly, in the eighty-five Federalist Papers, bankruptcy is mentioned but once, in a single, offhand sentence contained in an essay cataloguing miscellaneous inoffensive provisions.\\n\\nThe power of establishing uniform laws of bankruptcy, is so intimately connected with the regulation of commerce, and will prevent so many frauds where the parties or their property may lie or be removed into different States, that the expediency of it seems not likely to be drawn into question.\\n\\nFEDERALIST No. 42, at 287 (James Madison). The record strongly suggests that the bankruptcy power was seen as merely an adjunct to the main powers given to Congress by the Commerce Clause (and it appears directly thereafter in Article I.) Nothing suggests that it was viewed as more important than the Commerce Clause, or that Congress was given greater powers in that regard than with respect to the Commerce Clause.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\nMoreover, there is no corresponding \\u201cdormant\\u201d or \\u201cnegative\\u201d aspect to the Bankruptcy Clause, unlike the Commerce Clause. If Congress has not exercised its power to pass uniform laws on bankruptcy, States retain the power to enact bankrupt laws, so long as they do not violate the Contracts Clause of U.S. CONST. art. I, \\xa7 10. Sturges v. Crowninshield, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 122, 196-197 (1819). The mere existence of the bankruptcy power, if unexercised by Congress, does not preempt state action on the subject. Id.; Brown v. Smart, 145 U.S. 454, 457 (1892). Indeed, in the absence of federal laws, States could even discharge debts, so long as the discharge was properly limited in time and geographic scope. Ogden v. Saunders, 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 213 (1827).\\n\\nThe power transferred to the Federal Government by the Bankruptcy Clause is thus far more limited than the federal power over interstate commerce. If, as Seminole Tribe and its progeny have repeatedly held, Congress lacks the authority under even the \\u201cmost plenary\\u201d Article I powers that it possesses, then, a fortiori, Congress does not have the authority to abrogate state immunity under the bankruptcy power.\\n\\n\\n\\n3. This Court has already indicated that it views Seminole Tribe as applicable in bankruptcy. Any question about the applicability of Seminole Tribe in bankruptcy cases should have been laid to rest by the decision itself and this Court\\u2019s subsequent actions. In footnote 16 of the decision, the Court responded to the dissent\\u2019s concerns as to how the decision would affect various areas of federal law \\u2013 including bankruptcy. It noted that it had never held that state immunity could be\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\nabrogated under the bankruptcy provisions, and noted a number of alternative ways in which the supremacy of federal law could be ensured. To underscore that explicit statement, the Court soon after granted certiorari in In re Merchant\\u2019s Grain, 59 F. 3d 630 (7th Cir. 1995), which had held that Congress could abrogate state immunity under \\xa7 106(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. This Court vacated the decision, and remanded it for reconsideration in light of Seminole Tribe. Ohio Agricultural Commodity Depositors Fund v. Mahern, 517 U.S. 1130 (1996).2\\n\\nII. THE STATES DID NOT CEDE THEIR IMMU- NITY FROM SUIT IN BANKRUPTCY In light of the unequivocal holdings of this Court in Seminole Tribe and its progeny, and, particularly the explicit statements by both the majority and the dissent that the decision was expected to apply in bankruptcy, 11 U.S.C. \\xa7 106(a) would plainly appear to be unconstitutional, since it flatly states that it is an abrogation provision. Five circuit courts have so held with little difficulty.3\\n\\n2 The underlying facts of the case resulted in the suit against the State becoming moot before the Seventh Circuit had occasion to apply the Court\\u2019s directive. However, that circuit has since ruled on the issue and held in Nelson v. La Crosse County Dist. Atty., 301 F.3d 820 (7th Cir. 2002), that Seminole Tribe does apply in bankruptcy. 3 Nelson, 301 F.3d at 832 (7th Cir. 2002); Mitchell v. Franchise Tax Bd. of California (In re Mitchell), 209 F.3d 1111, 1121 (9th Cir. 2000); Sacred Heart Hosp. of Norristown v. Pennsylvania (In re Sacred Heart Hosp. of Norristown), 133 F.3d 237, 243 (3d Cir. 1998); Fernandez v. PNL Asset Mgmt. Co. (In re Fernandez), 123 F.3d 241, 243 (5th Cir.), amended by 130 F.3d 1138, 1139 (5th Cir. 1997); Schlossberg v. Maryland (In re Creative Goldsmiths of Washington, D.C., Inc.), 119 F.3d 1140, 1145-46 (4th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1075 (1998).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\nThe Sixth Circuit, alone, held that it need not apply Seminole Tribe literally, based on its conclusion that this Court had overlooked a crucial issue, arising from the interaction between Federalist Nos. 81 and 32. Relying on this purportedly new found issue, the Sixth Circuit concluded that Seminole Tribe did not apply in bankruptcy after all.\\n\\nIn reality, though, the argument that the Sixth Circuit \\u201cdiscovered\\u201d had, in fact, already been thoroughly aired before this Court almost twenty years ago. It failed to convince the Court then, and it has not become more compelling in the years since. As set forth below, the Sixth Circuit\\u2019s arguments are factually, legally, and logically without merit.\\n\\n\\n\\nA. The Federalist Papers Do Not Demonstrate That the States Ceded Their Immunity. The Sixth Circuit\\u2019s argument [Pet. App. 8] proceeds as follows. In Federalist No. 81 at 541, Alexander Hamilton begins his famous discussion about sovereign immunity in order to respond to criticisms that the new Constitution could alter or abolish the States\\u2019 judicial immunity from private suits for debts owned by the States. Hamilton seeks to reassure the States by noting that it is \\u201cinherent in the nature of sovereignty\\u201d for a State to be immune from suits by private persons without its consent and, as \\u201cone of the attributes of sovereignty,\\u201d that immunity could not be abolished unless there were a surrender thereof in the \\u201cplan of the convention.\\u201d Id. at 548-549. He then notes that in his earlier article on taxation (which is generally taken as referring to Federalist No. 32), he had discussed how States could alienate their sovereignty. That essay\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\ncontains a discussion of legislative issues and the various ways in which preemption of state law by federal enactments could occur.\\n\\nOne such principle is where the federal government is granted an authority \\u201cto which a similar authority in the States would be absolutely and totally contradictory and repugnant.\\u201d Id. at 200 (emphasis in original). As an example, Hamilton refers to the power to establish \\u201can uniform rule of naturalization.\\u201d The Sixth Circuit analysis then equates bankruptcy with this reference to naturalization (because both are in the same clause and use the word \\u201cuniform\\u201d) and concludes that this is an area in which the federal government must exercise complete power. The final leap of logic is to move from this discussion of legislative supremacy back to No. 81, and to conclude that Hamilton\\u2019s cross-reference to No. 32 was meant to indicate that if the States\\u2019 legislative sovereignty was \\u201calienated\\u201d there, then by the same token, so too was their sovereign immunity with respect to that power. Indeed, the court held that there was \\u201cno other explanation\\u201d for the linkage between Nos. 81 and 32, but for this equation of the waiver of legislative and judicial sovereignty, and, hence, concluded that the States had waived their immunity with respect to bankruptcy. [Pet. App. 19]\\n\\nAlthough the Sixth Circuit did not discuss any of the other aspects of No. 32, its ready equation of the cession of legislative authority in that article with the waiver of judicial immunity being discussed in No. 81 logically means that this same principle applies to any of the other forms of legislative preemption discussed in No. 32. While the scope of cession to federal authority might be less, there would be no reason to treat the ability to abrogate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n17\\n\\nwithin that authority any differently. Thus, Congress could abrogate to the same extent it can legislate.\\n\\n\\n\\n1. This Court has already declined to adopt this analysis. In fact, the very argument accepted by the Sixth Circuit has already been made to this Court in its full scope and breadth. In Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234 (1985), it was a primary focus of the 55-page dissent which mounted a frontal assault on the broad view of immunity that had been espoused in Hans and its progeny. The opinion traced the same steps from Federalist Nos. 81 to No. 32 and argued for the same conclusion in its fullest most logical form. The dissent\\u2019s conclusion was that \\u201c[i]n these areas, in which the Federal Government had substantive lawmaking authority, Article III\\u2019s federalquestion grant of jurisdiction gave the federal courts power that extended just as far as the legislative power of Congress.\\u201d Id., 473 U.S. at 277-78. That argument, though, did not carry the day in Atascadero.\\n\\nIn Union Gas, the four-member plurality again took the same view, asserting that there was no need to prove that a State consented to suit in a particular case because \\u201cthey gave their consent all at once, in ratifying the Constitution containing the Commerce Clause.\\u201d 491 U.S. at 20. That view when joined to the cryptic, one-sentence concurrence of Justice White governed for seven years, but it was definitively rejected in Seminole Tribe and cannot serve to validate the Sixth Circuit\\u2019s position in the decision below. The Sixth Circuit neither mentioned nor distinguished the decisions and analysis in Atascadero and Union Gas, and it provides no new insights that were not\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\nalready raised in the more detailed opinions in those cases. Seminole Tribe\\u2019s categorical rejection of the attempt to equate legislative and judicial sovereignty is dispositive of this case.\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Even if considered de novo, the analysis is without merit. While this Court did not adopt the dissent\\u2019s arguments in Atascadero, it did not engage in a point-by-point rebuttal of that specific part of the argument. But, even if examined de novo, the Sixth Circuit\\u2019s analysis fails for both legal and factual reasons and cannot override the effect of Seminole Tribe upon bankruptcy.\\n\\n\\n\\na. The argument, if accepted, would overrule Seminole Tribe. As noted above, the first critical problem with the argument is that, followed to its logical conclusion, it is wholly incompatible with Seminole Tribe. The Sixth Circuit only discusses the issue as to bankruptcy and the supposed exclusivity of federal power therein. But, as the dissent in the Atascadero decision makes clear, the logic of this analysis extends the scope of Congress\\u2019 power to the same extent as its power to legislate. Such a result is diametrically opposed to the holding in Seminole Tribe. The dissent\\u2019s rationale in Atascadero (and its descendant, Union Gas) say that all Article I powers can give Congress the power to abrogate immunity; Seminole Tribe and its progeny say that no Article I powers have that effect. The two analyses are flatly inconsistent and the decision below fails on this basis alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n19\\n\\nb. The Sixth Circuit\\u2019s interpretation of the relationship between Federalist Nos. 81 and 32 is illogical. Even if this Court had not already resolved this issue in Seminole Tribe, the analysis below would not make sense. The Sixth Circuit\\u2019s position relies on a dual inference \\u2013 that Hamilton viewed both legislative sovereignty and judicial sovereign immunity as parts of a single, undifferentiated concept of \\u201csovereignty\\u201d and that his discussion of the limitations of States\\u2019 legislative sovereignty in No. 32 was meant to impose a concomitant limitation on their sovereign immunity in No. 81. Those conclusions, though, make little sense in the context of the discussion in No. 81. As noted above, this discussion was to reassure those who had doubts about the protections afforded state sovereign immunity under the Constitution. A discussion that referred them to the broad set of circumstances in which federal legislative power could trump state actions and then concluded that, in all of those areas, federal laws could abolish state immunity would hardly have had the desired soothing effect. To the contrary, it would likely have further inflamed those fears.\\n\\nAfter the cross-reference to Federalist No. 32, Hamilton returned to his discussion by saying that \\u201cthere is no colour to pretend\\u201d that States would be subject to any constraint, i.e., private litigation, with respect to enforcing payment of their debts. He more likely, therefore, expected his words to be taken as giving the required reassurance by contrasting, not equating, the effects of legislative and judicial power on various aspects of state sovereignty. Plainly, then, and contrary to the Sixth Circuit\\u2019s view that its inference is the \\u201conly\\u201d one that can be drawn from\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\nthose words, the most logical inference is exactly the contrary.\\n\\n\\n\\nc. The uniformity requirement for bankruptcy laws does not require a different conclusion. The Sixth Circuit\\u2019s decision places a talismanic significance upon the reference to \\u201cuniform\\u201d laws of bankruptcy that does not hold up upon further examination. First, and most simplistically, the reference to \\u201cuniformity\\u201d allows the court to treat bankruptcy as having been dealt with in No. 32, when that essay actually referred only to uniformity regarding naturalization. Second, it is apparently meant to convey the impression that bankruptcy is a matter uniquely within federal control. Third, it apparently also seeks to suggest that it would be improper or indeed forbidden to have a bankruptcy law that treated States differently from other parties. Fourth, the reference could be taken to mean that there is such a strong federal interest in having the legislative provisions enforced that this interest can control over States\\u2019 sovereign immunity. None of these arguments withstands closer examination.\\n\\n\\n\\n(i) Bankruptcy and naturalization laws are not readily equated. Despite their common use of the word \\u201cuniform,\\u201d bankruptcy and naturalization laws otherwise have little in common. Once there was a truly functioning federal government, it was logically the only entity that could decide who would become a national citizen and that process would surely involve national standards. See\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\nFEDERALIST No. 42, at 285-287 (James Madison). That process would be largely administrative though and did not need to involve the States as potential parties at all. Certainly, it would be hard to imagine an instance in which a suit against a State would arise under the naturalization laws (and such cases cannot readily be found in a search of the existing precedents).\\n\\nThe inclusion of bankruptcy in the same clause, though, did not mean that the Framers assumed the two clauses were to have equal effects. Madison described naturalization and bankruptcy as distinctly different issues. FEDERALIST No. 42, at 285-287 (James Madison). Madison described at some length the present difficulties when States each defined citizenship in their own ways and could force other States to accept those persons as citizens under their laws. Id. at 286. Such conundrums required a uniform rule of naturalization which only Congress could prescribe. Id. at 285-287. That discussion, though, did not include any reference to the need to abrogate state immunity.\\n\\nIn contrast to that detailed treatment of naturalization, Madison, as noted above, wrote only one sentence about bankruptcy. In light of the far greater concerns about how to deal with the problems of naturalization and the stricter rule they would require, it is not surprising that when Hamilton gave an example of exclusive lawmaking authority, as to which the reservation of authority in the States would be \\u201cabsolutely and totally contradictory and repugnant,\\u201d he referred only to the Naturalization Clause, and not the Bankruptcy Clause, as well. FEDERAL- IST No. 32, at 200 (emphasis in original). The lower court\\u2019s assumption that the same reasoning that applies to the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\nNaturalization Clause also necessarily embraces the Bankruptcy Clause is simply unwarranted.\\n\\n\\n\\n(ii) The fact that a law must be \\u201cuniform\\u201d does not provide any greater federal authority than other Article I powers. The reference to \\u201cuniformity\\u201d is also presumably meant to show that Congress must have \\u201ccomplete\\u201d or \\u201cexclusive\\u201d authority to make laws in regards to that subject, or else there would not be a single, \\u201cuniform\\u201d law. Yet, unless one equates broad federal legislative authority with an equally broad federal right to abrogate immunity, this argument is simply a non sequitur. Leaving aside the residual state legislative authority that exists with respect to insolvency,4 the lack of state legislative authority (or, conversely, the breadth of federal authority) is irrelevant under Seminole Tribe. No matter how complete or exclusive \\u2013 or \\u201cuniform\\u201d \\u2013 the Article I lawmaking powers, they do not override state sovereign immunity, unless Seminole Tribe, Alden, et al., are themselves to be overridden. The court below cannot avoid the impact of Seminole Tribe by simply recasting a discussion about \\u201cplenary\\u201d powers into one about \\u201cuniform\\u201d powers.\\n\\n\\n\\n4 Indeed, even when Congress has exercised its power by passing a bankruptcy act, state laws in the field of insolvency are suspended only to the extent they actually conflict with the federal law. Stellwagen v. Clum, 245 U.S. 605, 613, 615 (1918).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n23\\n\\n(iii) The \\u201cuniformity\\u201d requirement has a limited meaning and does not mean that the States must be treated like all other parties. The Sixth Circuit further suggests that the uniformity requirement has substantive significance that goes beyond a mere requirement for geographic uniformity. That argument is unsupported by any precedent and flies in the face of the many, demonstrated ways in which the Bankruptcy Code does not treat all debtors, all creditors, or all claims in the same ways. On an objective analysis, the Bankruptcy Code is not nearly as \\u201cuniform\\u201d as a literal reading of that word might suggest.\\n\\nThis Court has never held that the uniformity re quirement extends beyond geographic uniformity or a bar on enactment of special legislation to protect only a single debtor.5 Geographic uniformity was referenced in Vanston Bondholders Protective Committee v. Green, 329 U.S. 156, 172-173 (1946) (Frankfurter, J., concurring) citing Hanover National Bank of the City of N.Y. v. Moyses, 186 U.S. 181, 190 (1902). The Railway Labor Executives case is the only time the Court has found that a law violated the special purpose bar because it provided relief to one, and\\n\\n5 In Railway Labor Executives\\u2019 Ass\\u2019n v. Gibbons, 455 U.S. 457, 472 (1982), the Court noted that, prior to the Constitution, States had passed many private acts to give discharges to individual debtors in the absence of general laws providing such relief. It was unclear whether such relief would be recognized in other states, which was the reason bankruptcy arose in the discussion about the Full Faith and Credit Clause. The uniformity requirement was included both to bar such private bills and to make them unnecessary by enacting laws applicable to all. Id. at 472-473.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\nonly one debtor. 455 U.S. at 469. Thus, uniformity is at most a highly flexible limit on the nature of bankruptcy laws that Congress may pass. As such, it can hardly prove that bankruptcy is a uniquely powerful federal power.6\\n\\nThis reality \\u2013 that bankruptcy law is not fully dictated by federal law, nor, indeed, overly uniform \\u2013 can be easily demonstrated. A bankruptcy law may be \\u201cuniform\\u201d even though it incorporates state law so that there are different results in different States. Railway Labor, 455 U.S. at 469; Stellwagen v. Clum, 245 U.S. 605, 613 (1918); Hanover Bank, 186 U.S. at 190 (bankruptcy trustee may \\u201cuniformly\\u201d take whatever property is available to creditors under relevant state law, even though this may have vastly different results in different States.)\\n\\nSimilarly, the current Bankruptcy Code uses state law to determine what are the \\u201cproperty\\u201d rights that go into the \\u201cproperty of the estate.\\u201d Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 54 (1979). And, under 11 U.S.C. \\xa7 522(b), state law 6 Indeed, it is difficult to see why a requirement that laws be \\u201cuniform\\u201d would be any sign of greater federal power. To the contrary, this would seem to be a limit on federal discretion that does not exist for the Commerce Clause, for instance. Railway Labor, 455 U.S. at 468 (uniformity provision is \\u201can affirmative limitation or restriction upon Congress\\u2019 power\\u201d unlike the Commerce Clause); Secretary of Agriculture v. Central Roig Refining Co., 338 U.S. 604, 616 (1950). Thus, if the federal government uses Commerce Clause powers to assist impoverished fisherman in Alaska or farmers in Iowa, it is not equally obligated to assist needy fisherman in Massachusetts or farmers in Mississippi. A robust enforcement of the uniformity clause, though, could limit many of the Code\\u2019s provisions enacted to deal with the special concerns and problems of a segment of debtors or creditors. Thus, this requirement plainly provides Congress with no greater power than the Commerce Clause and could indeed limit Congressional enactments had it not been interpreted in its current narrow scope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n25\\n\\nmay require \\u2013 to the total exclusion of federal law \\u2013 that their laws decide what comes out of the estate as exemptions.7 The \\u201cbasic federal rule\\u201d in bankruptcy is that state law governs the substance of claims and the burden of proof required. Raleigh v. Illinois Department of Revenue, 530 U.S. 15, 20 (2000) (citing Butner, 440 U.S. at 57 (1979)); 11 U.S.C. \\xa7 502(b)(1). Similarly, the determination of property rights in the assets of the estate are made under state law. Raleigh, id. (citing Butner, 440 U.S. at 54 (footnote omitted in original)). And, finally, the Bankruptcy Code does not create a federal right of setoff, but, instead, generally preserves existing setoff rights created under state law, in 11 U.S.C. \\xa7 553(a). Citizens Bank of Maryland v. Strumpf, 516 U.S. 16, 18 (1995). These are but a mere sampling \\u2013 bankruptcy law is permeated in every aspect with state law considerations, rather than being a system rigidly dictated solely by federal law.\\n\\nNor does the uniformity provision forbid Congress to distinguish between different classes of debtors, different industries, or different creditors. Railway Labor, 455 U.S. at 469 (\\u201cThe uniformity requirement of the Bankruptcy Clause is not an Equal Protection Clause for bankrupts.\\u201d) Id. at 471 n.11. Certain entities, such as insurance companies and most banks are not permitted to file for bankruptcy protection. 11 U.S.C. \\xa7 109(b)(2). There are special chapters\\n\\n7 State laws can vary widely and result in great disparity. Under Tennessee law, the homestead exemption may not exceed $5,000 for an individual or $7,500 for an individual and their spouse. TENN. CODE ANN. \\xa7 26-2-301(a). Under Florida law, the homestead exemption is unlimited in amount. FLA. CONST. art. X, \\xa7 4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n26\\n\\nfor family farmers, 11 U.S.C. \\xa7 1201 et seq., and municipalities 11 U.S.C. \\xa7 901 et seq., and railroads are not permitted to file under Chapter 7, but may file under Chapter 11. 11 U.S.C. \\xa7 109(b)(1) and (d).\\n\\nFurther, there are many areas in which the Code treats governmental units differently than other creditors. Taxes, for instance, receive priority under \\xa7 507(a)(8), but tax liens can be subordinated to priority creditors in \\xa7 724(b) and, under \\xa7 505, debtors have special rights to relitigate tax claims \\u2013 even those on which they defaulted prepetition. Similarly, there is a police and regulatory exception in \\xa7 362(b)(4) to the portion of the automatic stay set out in \\xa7 362(a), but governmental entities are subject to special anti-discrimination provisions in \\xa7 525 to which there is no police and regulatory exception. Federal Communications Comm\\u2019n v. Nextwave Personal Communications, Inc., 537 U.S. 293, 302 (2003). And, as pertains to this case, Congress has repeatedly tightened the limits on when debtors may discharge student loans that were \\u201cmade, insured or guaranteed by a governmental unit.\\u201d 11 U.S.C. \\xa7 523(a)(8).\\n\\nIn sum, the uniformity provision of the Bankruptcy Clause does not automatically preempt the entire field of bankruptcy, does not nullify all state laws on the subject, does not require that identical laws governing debtorcreditor relationships must apply in every State, and does not require Congress to treat all classes of debtors, creditors, or debts the same. To suggest that the uniformity requirement therefore confers exclusive power upon Congress to establish a perfectly uniform system of bankruptcy law at the expense of all rights of state sovereignty\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n27\\n\\nis to indulge a literalism wholly at odds with constitutional intent and with experience. A bankruptcy system which uniformly observes the sovereign immunity of the States from private-party suits is nonetheless constitutionally uniform. And, in the light of that well-established law and fact, the Sixth Circuit\\u2019s attempt to use the uniformity requirement as a way to accord a unique status that overrides the holding in Seminole Tribe cannot withstand scrutiny.\\n\\n\\n\\n(iv) This Court has rejected the argument that \\u201cuniformity\\u201d of federal regulation has independent constitutional significance. Finally, even if the Bankruptcy Clause did require strict, literal uniformity, however, such federal power would not eliminate the States\\u2019 immunity from private actions. The Patent Clause, for instance, by both its terms and its nature demands a uniform system of exclusively federal law to secure for \\u201cauthors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\\u201d U.S. CONST. art. I, \\xa7 8, cl. 8. Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. 141, 151-152 (1989) (state laws may not provide independent system of patent protection; federal law preempts the field). Yet, the Court has already held that, despite the need for uniformity, Article I of the Constitution did not divest the States of immunity from private-party suits in the areas of patent and trademark law. College Savings Bank, 527 U.S. at 669-670; Florida Prepaid, 527 U.S. at 636.\\n\\nThe Court rejected the argument that, \\u201c[t]he constitu tional necessity of uniformity in the regulation of maritime commerce\\u201d overrides the States\\u2019 legislative sovereignty in\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n28\\n\\nthe face of the Federal Government\\u2019s regulatory authority on that subject. Federal Maritime Comm\\u2019n, 535 U.S. at 767. Seminole Tribe, however, precludes creation of a new \\u201cmaritime commerce\\u201d exception to the States\\u2019 judicial sovereign immunity. Id. The arguments are no stronger here for the conclusion that the \\u201cuniformity\\u201d requirement in the Bankruptcy Clause is sufficient to override the States\\u2019 retained sovereign immunity.\\n\\nThis Court has previously held that there must be \\u201ccompelling evidence\\u201d of an intention to override the States\\u2019 immunity in the \\u201cplan of the Convention\\u201d in order to justify a finding that Congress has the power to do so. Blatchford, 501 U.S. at 781; Alden, 527 U.S. at 731, 741. If such evidence does not exist, and the suits would have been \\u201canomalous and unheard of \\u201d at the time of the Constitution, Hans, 134 U.S. at 18; Alden, 527 U.S. at 727, then there can be no finding that the States waived their immunity so as to allow Congress to abrogate it by legislative action.\\n\\nThere is no principled legal or factual basis for treating the Bankruptcy Clause any differently than the Commerce Clause, the Patent Clause, or other Article I powers. Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 72 n.16, and 517 U.S. at 77 n.1 (Stevens, J., dissenting). The States retain their inherent sovereign immunity from private-party suits in the field of bankruptcy.\\n\\nIII. SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY DOES NOT FORE- CLOSE ALL RELIEF TO A BANKRUPT STU- DENT LOAN DEBTOR. By asserting its sovereign immunity, the State of Tennessee by no means contends that it is free to disregard the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n29\\n\\nbankruptcy laws of the United States. Sovereign immunity from suit does not confer a right to disobey valid federal law. \\u201cThe States and their officers are bound by obligations imposed by the Constitution and by federal statutes that comport with the constitutional design.\\u201d Alden, 527 U.S. at 755. This Court has expressed unwillingness to assume that the States and their courts will refuse to honor the federal Constitution and laws. Id.\\n\\nThe Court has noted that, without offending the States\\u2019 sovereign immunity from private-party suits, there are other methods of ensuring state compliance with federal law, with varying methods applicable to different problems. Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 71 n.14. For example, an enforcement suit might be brought by the Federal Government itself against a State; or an individual might sue a state officer for prospective relief from an ongoing violation under the doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908).\\n\\nIn the specific context of the present case, the Debtor seeks discharge from a student loan debt which is presumptively nondischargeable under the applicable federal statute. 11 U.S.C. \\xa7 523(a)(8).8 Discharge of such a debt is only obtainable upon a showing of \\u201cundue hardship\\u201d to the debtor and her dependents. Id. Such an issue is not peculiarly a bankruptcy issue, however. It has nothing\\n\\n8 The debtor may also directly contact TSAC and arrange a payment plan or apply to obtain a grant to release the loan in conformity with the rules and regulations applicable to TSAC. 34 C.F.R. \\xa7 682.100 et seq. (2003); TENN. COMP. R. & REGS. 1640-1-2 et seq. (2003) (Guaranteed Student Loan Program).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n30\\n\\nwhatsoever to do with the validity of the debt or the priority of the debt, and is unrelated to any issues such as the distribution of assets of the bankrupt estate. There is no compelling reason requiring the question of \\u201cundue hardship\\u201d in this context to be decided by a federal bankruptcy judge. The appropriate and fully adequate remedy for a debtor seeking a discharge under 11 U.S.C. \\xa7 523(a)(8) is to raise the issue of \\u201cundue hardship\\u201d as a defense in any collection action that might be brought by the state creditor in state court. An adjudication in that setting, ultimately reviewable by this Court as a federal question, would balance the debtor \\u2019s interest, the general interest in honoring the federal law, and the fundamental, inherent sovereign immunity of the State.\\n\\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n31\\n\\nCONCLUSION For the reasons stated, the decision of the court of appeals should be reversed, and the Debtor \\u2019s complaint against the State in bankruptcy court should be dismissed.\\n\\nRespectfully submitted, PAUL G.
