Welcome to Benchmarked! This website is designed to explore how the Supreme Court of the United States of America operates. Using a multitude of [sources]({{site.baseurl}}data.html), we examine who and what makes up the Supreme Court. Specifically, we [explore]({{site.baseurl}}explore.html) from where and what type cases reach the Court and what the types of Justices serve on the Court. We attempt to identify whether there is any political [bias]({{site.baseurl}}bias.html) in how the court votes on certain legal issues. We develop models for predicting Supreme Court decisions based upon the [Justices]({{site.baseurl}}preds.html) reviewing the case and based upon the [legal arguments]({{site.baseurl}}preds2.html) brought forth by the lawyers who present the case. We [conclude]({{site.baseurl}}conclusions.html) with suggestions on potential applications and improvements to our model. Please view to the video for a overview. Enjoy!
