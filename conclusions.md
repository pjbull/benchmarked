##Results
According to our results and the data we gathered, the Supreme Court does not seem to be ideologically biased. Even if we perceived some tendencies, Decisions taken by justices appointed by Democrat/Republican
U.S. Presidents are more liberal or conservative depending on the case types. Conservative (Liberal) decisions are not the sole property of the Republican (Democrat) justices.

We were also able the predict (at some point) the outcome of cases based on justices' profiles. THe citation network (and all the measures associated) was not a relevant enough feature to take into account in our
prediction model.
