      "The data used in this notebook comes from The Supreme Court Database and ______. The Supreme Court Database is a publicly available data bank started in the 1980s by Harold J Spaeth, PhD, JD with a grant from the National Science Foundation to facilitate research on the Supreme Court. The accuracy of data has been externally validated and is used widely by legal academics for studies of Supreme Court decisions.  From its inception, the databank has expanded to document every vote made by the Supreme Court since 1946. In its current form, the data bank contains 247 variables for each vote. The variables, or features, of the dataset can be generalized into six main groups: identification, background, chronological, substantive, outcome, and voting/opinion variables. To make the database more tenable, we refined the database to fifty features of interest. Specifically, features were chosen based on their relevance to objectifying patterns within Supreme Court decisions.  Numerous features, such as 'Docket Number', 'Case Number', and 'Natural Court', were able to be removed simply because the variable represent irrelevant, procedural data that was present only due to the thoroughness of the data bank's documentation of the votes or because the variable was deemed to be supplementary to data present in the retained features. The retained features with which exploratory analysis is proceed upon include information on the origins each case brought before the Court for review, details of Judge votes/opinions, and statistics on Court composition."
