&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;BALTIMORE CONTRACTORS, INC.&lt;br&gt;
v.&lt;br&gt;
BODINGER.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;No. 31.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued November 9, 1954.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided January 10, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Morris Rosenberg&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;George Brussel, Jr.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Charles Wilson&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question in this case is whether an appeal may be taken to a court of appeals from a district court order refusing to stay an action for an accounting pending arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This equitable action was brought in a state court for an accounting of the profits of a joint venture in construction under the National Housing Act, and was removed to a federal district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship. Under the joint venture agreement, Baltimore &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*177&lt;/span&gt; Contractors agreed to pay the respondent twenty-five percent of the net profits on its construction contracts. The provision under which arbitration was sought reads as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the event of any dispute in the calculation of the net profits under this Paragraph, Frenkil shall select either Wooden and Benson or Haskins and Sells or an accountant or auditor named by either of them whose determination of all such disputes shall be final and binding upon all parties to the dispute."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint alleged a number of improper practices on the part of Contractors: the use of "dummy" corporations to inflate costs; charges for machinery and material purchases without credits for value or surpluses after completion of the job; receipt of undisclosed rebates; excessive charges and rental for equipment; padded insurance costs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petitioner moved for a stay of the action pursuant to &#167; 3 of the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C. &#167; 3, which authorizes a stay by a federal court when an issue is "referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration." The District Court refused the stay on the ground that the agreement between the parties did not constitute an agreement to arbitrate. The court apparently construed the quoted provision as limited to mathematical disputes. Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On respondent's motion the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal, citing &lt;i&gt;Morgantown&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Royal Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 337 U. S. 254. Certiorari was sought on the following question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whether in an action for an &lt;i&gt;accounting&lt;/i&gt; an interlocutory order denying a stay under Section 3 of the United States Arbitration Act should be regarded as a denial of an injunction from which an appeal lies."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*178&lt;/span&gt; In view of the conflict between the decision below and &lt;i&gt;Hudson Lumber Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States Plywood Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 181 F. 2d 929, we granted the petition, 347 U. S. 942.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress has long expressed a policy against piecemeal appeals. The reasons for such a policy were stated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"From the very foundation of our judicial system the object and policy of the acts of Congress in relation to appeals and writs of error, (with the single exception of a provision in the act of 1875 in relation to cases of removal, which was repealed by the act of 1887,) have been to save the expense and delays of repeated appeals in the same suit, and to have the whole case and every matter in controversy in it decided in a single appeal." &lt;i&gt;McLish&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Roff,&lt;/i&gt; 141 U. S. 661, 665-666.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 84, provided that appeals in civil actions could be taken to the circuit courts only from final decrees and judgments.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; That requirement of finality has remained a part of our &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*179&lt;/span&gt; law ever since, and now appears as &#167; 1291 of the Judicial Code.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial court's interpretation of the quoted contract clause and its order denying a stay could not be called a final decision under &#167; 1291. It was as surely an interlocutory order as the District Court's order in &lt;i&gt;Shanferoke Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Westchester Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 293 U. S. 449, 451.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*180&lt;/span&gt; The question here presented involves the interpretation of 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1292 (1) which makes an exception to the requirement of finality, permitting appeals from "interlocutory orders . . . granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions, except where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court." Appealability here turns on whether the District Court's refusal to stay this trial for arbitration was the refusal of an "injunction" under &#167; 1292.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provision for interlocutory appeals was first introduced in 1891 when the circuit courts of appeals were established as intermediate appellate courts. 26 Stat. 826. Section 7 of that Act allowed appeals from interlocutory orders in equity "granting or continuing" injunctions, but from those only. Additions to the class of appealable interlocutory orders were made from time to time until the enactment of &#167; 1292 in its present form.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*181&lt;/span&gt; No discussion of the underlying reasons for modifying the rule of finality appears in the legislative history, although the changes seem plainly to spring from a developing need to permit litigants to effectually challenge interlocutory orders of serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; When the pressure rises to a point that influences Congress, legislative remedies are enacted. The Congress is in a position to weigh the competing interests of the dockets of the trial and appellate courts, to consider the practicability of savings in time and expense; and to give proper weight to the effect on litigants. When countervailing considerations arise, interested parties and organizations become active in efforts to modify the appellate jurisdiction.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; This Court, however, is not authorized to approve or declare judicial modification. It is the responsibility of all courts to see that no unauthorized extension or reduction of jurisdiction, direct or indirect, occurs in the federal system. &lt;i&gt;Shanferoke Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Westchester Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 293 U. S. 449, 451. Any such &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt; decisions disorganize practice by encouraging attempts to secure or oppose appeals with a consequent waste of time and money. The &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*182&lt;/span&gt; choices fall in the legislative domain. They are enlargement of the allowable list of appealable interlocutory orders; abandonment of fragmentary appeals; or a general allowance of such appeals in the discretion of the trial judge upon findings of need, with or without the consent or approval of the appellate court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of decisions of this Court has developed the rationale for determining the appealability of such an interlocutory order as this under &#167; 1292 and its predecessors. The appealability of routine interlocutory injunctive orders raised few questions. See &lt;i&gt;George&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Victor Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 293 U. S. 377. There the statute was clear. It was when stays of proceedings, in distinction to injunctions, were appealed that the issue of jurisdiction became sharp. In &lt;i&gt;Enelow&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York Life Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 293 U. S. 379, a case arising when federal courts had actions at law and proceedings in equity, a complaint at common law on a life insurance policy was met by an answer alleging fraud in the policy's procurement with a prayer for its cancellation and a motion to try the equitable issue first. The motion was granted, and jurisdiction on appeal from that order was approved on this reasoning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The power to stay proceedings in another court appertains distinctively to equity in the enforcement of equitable principles, and the grant or refusal of such a stay by a court of equity of proceedings at law is a grant or refusal of an injunction within the meaning of &#167; 129 [&#167; 1292]. And, in this aspect, it makes no difference that the two cases, the suit in equity for an injunction and the action at law in which proceedings are stayed, are both pending in the same court, in view of the established distinction between `proceedings at law and proceedings in equity in the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*183&lt;/span&gt; national courts and between the powers of those courts when sitting as courts of law and when sitting as courts of equity.' Per Van Devanter, J., in &lt;i&gt;Griesa&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mutual Life Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 165 Fed. 48, 50, 51." 293 U. S., at 382.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the adoption of the one form of action by the Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 2, we reiterated this ruling in a like case. &lt;i&gt;Ettelson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Metropolitan Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 317 U. S. 188. We said a stay of the complaint until disposition of the fraud issue "is as effective . . . as an injunction. . . . The statute looks to the substantial effect of the order made."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point was made in the &lt;i&gt;Enelow&lt;/i&gt; case that power to stay mere steps within the framework of the litigation before a court differs as to appealability from an injunction prohibiting proceedings in another court. This distinction was applied in &lt;i&gt;Morgantown&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Royal Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 337 U. S. 254. There the insurance company brought a suit for reformation of the contract. The insured counter-claimed, seeking to enforce the contract as written, and demanded a jury trial; the company moved to strike the demand; the court granted the motion and set the case for trial to the court without a jury. The insured appealed and the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal. We affirmed, holding that the &lt;i&gt;Enelow&lt;/i&gt; rule did not apply; that since this was an equitable proceeding with a counter-claim to enforce the policy, the decision to hear the reformation issue first without a jury was only a decision as to how to try the case, and therefore was not an interlocutory order in the nature of an injunction. To the argument that the importance of a jury trial justified &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*184&lt;/span&gt; treating the order of trial as an interlocutory injunction, we answered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Many interlocutory orders are equally important, and may determine the outcome of the litigation, but they are not for that reason converted into injunctions." 337 U. S., at 258.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Morgantown&lt;/i&gt; case controls here.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; Whether the District Court was right or wrong in its ruling that the contract provision did not require arbitration proceedings, it was simply a ruling in the only suit pending, actual or fictional. It was a mere order and not an injunction as that word is understood through the &lt;i&gt;Enelow&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;Ettelson&lt;/i&gt; cases as a stay through equitable principles of a common-law action. This present case is to be distinguished from the &lt;i&gt;Shanferoke&lt;/i&gt; case, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; note 5, in the same way. There in a common-law action a motion for an interlocutory injunction on an equitable defense was refused. The order was appealable under Judicial Code &#167; 129. This Court said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"For the reasons stated in &lt;i&gt;Enelow&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York Life Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; decided this day, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 379, an order granting or denying a stay based on an equitable defense or cross-bill interposed in an action at law under &#167; 274b, is appealable under &#167; 129." 293 U. S., at 452.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reliance on the analogy of equity power to enjoin proceedings in other courts has elements of fiction in this day of one form of action. The incongruity of taking jurisdiction from a stay in a law type and denying jurisdiction in an equity type proceeding springs from the persistence of outmoded procedural differentiations. Some simplification would follow from an assumption or denial of jurisdiction in both. The distinction has been &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*185&lt;/span&gt; applied for years, however, and we conclude that it is better judicial practice to follow the precedents which limit appealability of interlocutory orders, leaving Congress to make such amendments as it may find proper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to generalize as to whether interlocutory appeals are or are not advantageous to an efficient administration of justice. A compromise has been worked out by Congress through &#167; 1292. But that compromise does not authorize appeals to simplify litigation. This ruling was a step in controlling the litigation before the trial court, not the refusal of an interlocutory injunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BURTON concurs in the judgment of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concurs, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the District Court's order denying a stay is appealable because it is (1) "final" within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1291 and (2) a refusal to grant an interlocutory injunction within the meaning of &#167; 1292. As the Court admits, a collateral issue may be so severable and unrelated to central trial issues that a judgment on the collateral issue is considered "final" and appealable under &#167; 1291, even though other important issues are left undecided. Given this common sense meaning &#167; 1291 authorizes the present appeal. For certainly decision of whether a judicial rather than an arbitration tribunal shall hear and determine this accounting controversy is logically and practically severable from the factual and legal issues crucial to determination of the merits of the controversy. And this Court has held that &#167; 1292 makes all stay orders appealable that have the substantial effect of interlocutory injunction orders. &lt;i&gt;Ettelson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Metropolitan&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*186&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 317 U. S. 188. The refusal to stay here had that effect. Indeed, the Court seems to admit that this order refusing a stay would be appealable had it been entered by another judge not presiding in this particular case. I agree with the Court that this jurisdictional "incongruity. . . springs from the persistence of outmoded procedural differentiations" that have "elements of fiction" in this modern day. I do not agree that the Court's obeisance to these incongruous fictions is required by congressional enactments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court relies on a purpose of Congress to avoid a waste of time and money incident to repeated "piecemeal" appeals in the same suit. But, as pointed out, Congress, in &#167;&#167; 1291 and 1292, has left the way open for the appeal of many judgments finally deciding collateral and severable issues separately adjudicated in a case. Any rigid rule to the contrary would itself guarantee useless delays and expenses. For two trials, one unnecessary, may take longer and cost more than two appeals where one would do. Take this case for example. It must now go back for a court accounting trial which could be time-consuming and expensive to litigants and to the Government. And should petitioner lose on the merits it could undoubtedly appeal. On that review the first question for the appellate court would be whether the order denying arbitration, which the Court now refuses to consider, was right or wrong. If found wrong, the trial court's judgment on the merits would have to be vacated and the case again sent back for determination on the merits&#151;this time by arbitration. In that event the trial the Court now orders will have been wholly futile&#151;not even the litigant who now appears to be successful will have gained anything from it, unless perchance he stands to profit from delay. There is some difficulty, at least, in laying this wasteful procedure at the door of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The &lt;i&gt;Hudson Lumber Co.&lt;/i&gt; case was a suit for a declaratory judgment as to the meaning of certain contract provisions with a prayer for incidental injunctive relief. Appeal was allowed by the Court of Appeals from the District Court order staying the trial pending resort to arbitration as required by the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  See &lt;i&gt;Catlin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 324 U.

&lt;p&gt;[3]  This enlarged the English rule for there interlocutory appeals were allowed in equity, although not at common law. 1 Holdsworth's History of English Law 214; Crick, The Final Judgment as a Basis for Appeal, 41 Yale L. J. 539, 540-548, 551. Section 22 was rigorously enforced. &lt;i&gt;Rutherford&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fisher,&lt;/i&gt; 4 Dall. 22; &lt;i&gt;Young&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Grundy,&lt;/i&gt; 6 Cranch 51. Fragmentary appeals were denounced. &lt;i&gt;Canter&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Ins.

S. 684, 688; &lt;i&gt;Cohen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Beneficial Loan Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 337 U. S. 541, 546; &lt;i&gt;Cogen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 278 U. S. 221. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Bandini Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Superior Court,&lt;/i&gt; 284 U. S. 8, 14-15; &lt;i&gt;Radio Station WOW&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Johnson,&lt;/i&gt; 326 U. S. 120, 124; &lt;i&gt;Montgomery Union&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ledbetter Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 344 U. S. 178. See Underwood, Appeals in the Federal Practice from Collateral Orders, 36 Va. L. Rev. 731.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of finality does not require a judgment completely disposing of every matter or issue that arises in the litigation. Some collateral issues may become "so served . . . as to permit an appeal." &lt;i&gt;Cobbledick&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 309 U. S. 323, 328.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  &lt;i&gt;Shanferoke Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Westchester Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 293 U. S. 449, was a suit at common law to recover damages for breach of a contract containing an arbitration clause. A motion was made to stay the suit until arbitration. The motion was denied because the trial court thought the arbitration clause applicable only to New York litigation. This Court held that the order was interlocutory and was appealable under &#167; 129 of the Judicial Code of 1911, the predecessor of 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1292 (1). The ruling followed &lt;i&gt;Enelow&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York Life Ins. Co., infra,&lt;/i&gt; p. 182.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wilko&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Swan,&lt;/i&gt; 201 F. 2d 439, reversed on issues not pertinent here, 346 U. S. 427, was a suit for statutory damages. It allowed an appeal under 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1292 to the Court of Appeals from a District Court interlocutory order refusing a stay sought pursuant to the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C. &#167; 3. The &lt;i&gt;Shanferoke&lt;/i&gt; case was cited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  In 1895, &#167; 7 was amended to permit an appeal from interlocutory orders refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve an injunction. 28 Stat. 666. A further amendment was made in 1900 to include certain orders in receiverships. 31 Stat. 660. This amendment had the effect of repealing the 1895 provision which was restored in &#167; 129 of the Judicial Code of 1911. 36 Stat. 1087, 1134. See Frankfurter and Landis, The Business of the Supreme Court, 124-127. The amendment of 1925, 43 Stat. 937, made two changes: First, it embraced orders modifying or refusing to modify injunctions and expanded the number of orders in receiverships which were appealable. Second, it dropped the words "in equity" from the phrase "where upon a hearing in equity in a district court" which had been employed since the initial enactment of &#167; 7 in 1891. No change was intended by that omission. &lt;i&gt;Schoenamsgruber&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hamburg Line,&lt;/i&gt; 294 U. S. 454, 457, n. 3. In 1927, provision was made for interlocutory appeals in patent cases which are final save for an accounting, 44 Stat. 1261. Interlocutory appeals in bankruptcy cases are covered by &#167; 24 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U. S. C. &#167; 47.

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Richard H. Switzer&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cleve Burton&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for appellants-petitioners. With them on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Val Irion.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*67&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Benjamin C. King&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the Employers Liability Assurance Corporation, Ltd., appellee-respondent. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Charles D. Egan.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisiana has an insurance code which comprehensively regulates the business of insurance in all its phases.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; This case brings to us challenges to the constitutionality of certain provisions of that code allowing injured persons to bring direct actions against liability insurance companies that have issued policies contracting to pay liabilities imposed on persons who inflict injury. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Lumbermen's Mutual Casualty Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Elbert,&lt;/i&gt; decided today, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 48. This is such a direct action brought by the appellants, Mr. and Mrs. Watson, in a Louisiana state court claiming damages against the appellee, Employers Liability Assurance Corporation, Ltd., on account of alleged personal injuries suffered by Mrs. Watson. The complaint charged that the injuries occurred in Louisiana when Mrs. Watson bought and used in that State "Toni Home Permanent" a hair-waving product alleged to have contained a highly dangerous latent ingredient put there by its manufacturer. The manufacturer is the Toni Company of Illinois, a subsidiary of the Gillette Safety Razor Company which has its headquarters in Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The particular problem presented with reference to enforcing the Louisiana statute in this case arises because the insurance policy sued on was negotiated and issued in Massachusetts and delivered in Massachusetts and Illinois.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; This Massachusetts-negotiated contract contains &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*68&lt;/span&gt; a clause, recognized as binding and enforceable under Massachusetts and Illinois law, which prohibits direct actions against the insurance company until &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; final determination of the Toni Company's obligation to pay personal injury damages either by judgment or agreement.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Contrary to this contractual "no action" clause, the challenged statutory provisions permit injured persons to sue an insurance company &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; such final determination. As to injuries occurring in Louisiana, one provision of the State's direct action statute makes it applicable, even though, as here, an insurance contract is made in another state and contains a clause forbidding such direct actions.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; Another Louisiana statutory provision, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*69&lt;/span&gt; with which Employers long ago complied, compels foreign insurance companies to consent to such direct suits in order to get a certificate to do business in the State.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; The basic issue raised by the attack on both these provisions is whether the Federal Constitution forbids Louisiana to apply its own law and compels it to apply the law of Massachusetts or Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the case was removed to the United States District Court because of diversity Employers moved to dismiss, contending that the two Louisiana statutory provisions contravened the Equal Protection, Contract, Due Process and Full Faith and Credit Clauses of the Federal Constitution. With emphasis on the due process contention, the District Court dismissed the case, holding both statutory provisions unconstitutional as to policies written and delivered outside the State of Louisiana. 107 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*70&lt;/span&gt; F. Supp. 494.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court and affirmed the dismissal. 202 F. 2d 407. Provisions of Louisiana's statutes having been held invalid as repugnant to the Federal Constitution, the case is properly here on appeal.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The denial of equal protection and impairment of contract contentions are wholly void of merit. The State's direct action provisions fall with equal force upon all liability insurance companies, foreign and domestic. Employers points to no other provisions of the Louisiana law or to facts of any nature which give the slightest support to any charge of discriminatory application of the direct action statute. And since the direct action provisions became effective before this insurance contract was made, there is a similar lack of substantiality in the suggestion that Louisiana has violated Art. I, &#167; 10, of the United States Constitution which forbids states to impair the obligation of contracts. &lt;i&gt;Munday&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin Trust Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 252 U. S. 499, 503.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had the policy sued on been issued in Louisiana there would be no arguable due process question. See &lt;i&gt;Merchants Mutual Auto. Liability Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Smart,&lt;/i&gt; 267 U. S. 126, 129-130. But because the policy was bought, issued and delivered outside of Louisiana, Employers invokes the due process principle that a state is without power to exercise "extraterritorial jurisdiction," that is, to regulate and control activities wholly beyond its boundaries. Such a principle was recognized and applied in &lt;i&gt;Home Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dick,&lt;/i&gt; 281 U. S. 397, a case strongly relied on by &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*71&lt;/span&gt; Employers. There Texas was denied power to alter the terms of an insurance contract made in Mexico between persons then in that country, covering a vessel only while in Mexican waters, and containing a provision that the contract was to be governed by the laws of Mexico. Thus, the subject matter of the contract related in no manner to anything that had been done or was to be done in Texas. For this reason, Texas was denied power to alter the obligations of the Mexican contract. But this Court carefully pointed out that its decision might have been different had activities relating to the contract taken place in Texas upon which the State could properly lay hold as a basis for regulation. &lt;i&gt;Home Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dick, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 408 n. 5. The extraterritorial due process doctrine was again applied in &lt;i&gt;Hartford Accident &amp;amp; Indemnity Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Delta &amp;amp; Pine Land Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 292 U. S. 143. That case denied the power of Mississippi to alter terms of an insurance contract made in Tennessee. Mississippi activities in connection with the policy were found to be so "slight" and so "casual" that Mississippi could not apply its own law in such way as to enlarge the obligations of the Tennessee contract. Again, however, the Court carefully noted that there might be future cases in which the terms of out-of-state contracts would be so repugnant to the vital interests of the forum state as to justify nonenforcement. &lt;i&gt;Hartford Accident &amp;amp; Indemnity Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Delta &amp;amp; Pine Land Co., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 150. See also &lt;i&gt;Griffin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McCoach,&lt;/i&gt; 313 U. S. 498, and cases there cited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some contracts made locally, affecting nothing but local affairs, may well justify a denial to other states of power to alter those contracts. But, as this case illustrates, a vast part of the business affairs of this Nation does not present such simple local situations. Although this insurance contract was issued in Massachusetts, it was to protect Gillette and its Illinois subsidiary against damages on account of personal injuries that might be &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*72&lt;/span&gt; suffered by users of Toni Home Permanent anywhere in the United States, its territories, or in Canada. As a consequence of the modern practice of conducting wide-spread business activities throughout the entire United States, this Court has in a series of cases held that more states than one may seize hold of local activities which are part of multistate transactions and may regulate to protect interests of its own people, even though other phases of the same transactions might justify regulatory legislation in other states. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Osborn&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ozlin,&lt;/i&gt; 310 U. S. 53; &lt;i&gt;Hoopeston Canning Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cullen,&lt;/i&gt; 318 U. S. 313; &lt;i&gt;Alaska Packers Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commission,&lt;/i&gt; 294 U. S. 532.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisiana's direct action statute is not a mere inter-meddling in affairs beyond her boundaries which are no concern of hers. Persons injured or killed in Louisiana are most likely to be Louisiana residents, and even if not, Louisiana may have to care for them. Serious injuries may require treatment in Louisiana homes or hospitals by Louisiana doctors. The injured may be destitute. They may be compelled to call upon friends, relatives, or the public for help. Louisiana has manifested its natural interest in the injured by providing remedies for recovery of damages. It has a similar interest in policies of insurance which are designed to assure ultimate payment of such damages. Moreover, Louisiana courts in most instances provide the most convenient forum for trial of these cases. But modern transportation and business methods have made it more difficult to serve process on wrongdoers who live or do business in other states. In this case efforts to serve the Gillette Company were answered by a motion to dismiss on the ground that Gillette had no Louisiana agent on whom process could be served. If this motion is granted, Mrs. Watson, but for the direct action law, could not get her case tried without going to Massachusetts or Illinois although she lives in Louisiana and her claim is for injuries from a product &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*73&lt;/span&gt; bought and used there. What has been said is enough to show Louisiana's legitimate interest in safeguarding the rights of persons injured there. In view of that interest, the direct action provisions here challenged do not violate due process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we have said above goes far toward answering the Full Faith and Credit Clause contention. That clause does not automatically compel a state to subordinate its own contract laws to the laws of another state in which a contract happens to have been formally executed. Where, as here, a contract affects the people of several states, each may have interests that leave it free to enforce its own contract policies. &lt;i&gt;Alaska Packers Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commission,&lt;/i&gt; 294 U. S. 532, 544-550. See &lt;i&gt;Griffin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McCoach,&lt;/i&gt; 313 U. S. 498, 506-507. We have already pointed to the vital interests of Louisiana in liability insurance that covers injuries to people in that State. Of course Massachusetts also has some interest in the policy sued on in this case. The insurance contract was formally executed in that State and Gillette has an office there. But plainly these interests cannot outweigh the interest of Louisiana in taking care of those injured in Louisiana. Since this is true, the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not compel Louisiana to subordinate its direct action provisions to Massachusetts contract rules. &lt;i&gt;Pacific Employers Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commission,&lt;/i&gt; 306 U. S. 493, 503. But cf. &lt;i&gt;John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Yates,&lt;/i&gt; 299 U. S. 178; &lt;i&gt;Hughes&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fetter,&lt;/i&gt; 341 U. S. 609.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we have already said disposes of the contention that Louisiana's law compelling foreign insurance companies to consent to direct actions is unconstitutional. That contention is that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids a state to compel a foreign corporation to surrender constitutional rights as a condition of being permitted to do business in the state. See &lt;i&gt;Terral&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Burke Construction Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 257 U. S. 529. That &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*74&lt;/span&gt; principle is inapplicable to this case because, as we have just decided, Louisiana has a constitutional right to subject foreign liability insurance companies to the direct action provisions of its laws whether they consent or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I agree with the Court's result, I find the course of reasoning by which it is reached not without serious obstacles. Since the difficulties involve constitutional issues, decision upon them should be avoided if a less doubtful ground is available. In my opinion there is a basis which readily invites today's decision. Whether Louisiana may rewrite a contract, whose obligations are determined by Massachusetts or Illinois, by deleting a substantial feature of that contract and thereby enlarging the obligation of the insurance company, surely raises a serious question affecting the constitutional relationships of the States one to another. Contrariwise, whether Louisiana, free as it was to exclude the insurance company from coming into the State to do business, was empowered to condition the company's entry by an undertaking to observe a public policy binding on all local insurance companies and strictly related to the protection of serious interests of its own citizens, seems to me a question easier of solution. Accordingly I would rest the decision on this ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This controversy arises out of a contract made between Employers' Liability Assurance Corp., a British corporation, and the Toni Company, a division of the Gillette Safety Razor Co., a Delaware corporation with principal offices in Boston, Massachusetts. The contract contained this provision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"No action shall lie against the company unless, as a condition precedent thereto, the insured shall have &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*75&lt;/span&gt; fully complied with all the terms of this policy, nor until the amount of the insured's obligation to pay shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the insured after actual trial or by written agreement of the insured, the claimant and the company."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was issued and delivered in Massachusetts to Gillette and a copy delivered in Illinois to Toni. Happily, it is not necessary to determine whether the obligations flowing from this contract are determined exclusively by the law of Massachusetts or by the law of Illinois. Concededly, both States recognize the right of an insurance company to safeguard its treasury by making its indirect liability to a third person contingent on a judgment against the insured or compromise settlement participated in by the insurer. Howsoever the fact may be phrased or explained away, to allow suits by a third-party claimant directly against the insurance company prior to a judgment against the insured is to subject the insurance company to an obligation which it had not undertaken and which indeed it had expressly refused to assume. In sanctioning the protection of insurance funds afforded by the "no-action" clause, Massachusetts and Illinois have expressed state policy of the same constitutional authority as Louisiana asserted in its legislation allowing direct actions. Massachusetts is deeply concerned with the fiscal well-being of insurance companies whose activities center in that State; this is of considerable importance to its citizens. In addition, both Massachusetts and Illinois share concern for the interest of the insured in the scope and nature of the obligations which bind as well as protect him. The premiums payable by the insured under this policy varied directly with the losses paid by the insurer and to that extent the insured had a stake in the "no-action" clause. To treat that clause as though it were a redundant or an insubstantial part of the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*76&lt;/span&gt; agreement is to flout familiar experience of the readiness of juries to amerce insurance companies.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resolve these conflicting policies solely on the basis of the public policy of Louisiana is to assume that there is only one principle involved in a problem when in fact there are conflicting principles of equal relevance. This Court has not heretofore disregarded the interests of States in the position of Massachusetts and Illinois by exclusive regard for the policy of a State in the position of Louisiana when regard for its interest necessarily tangles with the interests of sister States. To be sure, a State may refuse to give affirmative help in enforcing a contract valid in a sister State where the obligation was incurred, but against its own policy. At least it may do so insofar as the Full Faith and Credit Clause is no barrier. But to deny judicial enforcement of a contract through its courts when such contract sufficiently offends local policy is a very different thing from rewriting a contract and enforcing it in a manner contrary to the undertaking of the makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Louisiana's attempt to change the terms of the contract of insurance in this case presents a serious question, apart from the power of Louisiana to exclude a foreign insurance company or admit it on condition, is emphatically shown by &lt;i&gt;Hartford Accident &amp;amp; Indemnity Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Delta &amp;amp; Pine Land Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 292 U. S. 143. In that case an action was brought in Mississippi on a fidelity bond insuring against employee defalcations "in any position anywhere." The bond had been issued while the executive offices of the insured were temporarily in Tennessee, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*77&lt;/span&gt; and was issued and delivered in that State. After the insured moved its main offices to Mississippi, the State of its incorporation, suit was brought there for its treasurer's thieving in Mississippi. The policy contained a provision that a claim under the contract must be made within 15 months after the termination of suretyship for the defaulting employee. The claim was not made within that period, but the Mississippi Supreme Court held that this condition was not enforceable because contrary to a Mississippi statute. This Court reversed the Mississippi court, holding that the Mississippi statute could not disregard the limiting provision of the contract. The principle was laid down that a State may not "in an action based upon such a contract enlarge the obligations of the parties to accord with every local statutory policy solely upon the ground that one of the parties is its own citizen." 292 U. S., at 149. Joining in this unanimous decision were two members, Mr. Chief Justice Hughes and Mr. Justice Brandeis, who probably had more specialized knowledge to make them aware that "Government has always had a special relation to insurance," &lt;i&gt;Osborn&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ozlin,&lt;/i&gt; 310 U. S. 53, 65, than any other Justices ever to sit on this Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;i&gt;Hartford Indemnity&lt;/i&gt; case, as here, the policy covered transitory risks, without a defined situs, and the State of the forum had a foreseeable concern with the protection of assets within its jurisdiction at the time the policy was issued, for the policy issued listed 21 employees who were then working in Mississippi. Nevertheless, Mississippi, the State of the forum, was not allowed to enlarge the obligations of a contract elsewhere validly consummated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our more recent cases have not made inroad on the governing consideration in the &lt;i&gt;Hartford Indemnity&lt;/i&gt; case, that the State which fixes the terms of insurance contracts has interests to be protected by the Constitution no less important than has a State which seeks to excise &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*78&lt;/span&gt; provisions of such a contract. In both the &lt;i&gt;Osborn&lt;/i&gt; case, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Hoopeston Canning Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cullen,&lt;/i&gt; 318 U. S. 313, the Court was concerned merely with the validity of legislation of a regulatory nature. In neither was the Court faced with the problem of applying to an existing valid contract made outside the State local law modifying such contract. Realization that the Louisiana statute, in the context of this case, raises the delicate problem of balancing interests&#151;that refractory aspect of due process&#151;admonishes its avoidance when an easier solution lies at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These, then, are the formidable constitutional hurdles that would have to be cleared were this an action against an insurance company which, somehow or other, was duly served in Louisiana but which had not exercised the privilege of doing business there subject to the condition of amenability to Louisiana direct action statutes. I have no doubt, however, that Louisiana can exact from Employers', as it did, valid consent to direct action in the case of injuries inflicted in Louisiana upon its citizens by Employers' policyholders. It can do so as part of the fair bargain by which it gave hospitality to Employers' for doing business in Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the grain is winnowed from the chaff in some hundred opinions dealing with so-called "unconstitutional conditions," insofar as they relate to the power of a State to exclude a foreign corporation or condition its entry, the residuum is clear. In an early leading case the State's authority was asserted in absolute terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Having no absolute right of recognition in other States, but depending for such recognition and the enforcement of its contracts upon their assent, it follows, as a matter of course, that such assent may be granted upon such terms and conditions as those States may think proper to impose. They may exclude the foreign corporation entirely; they may &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*79&lt;/span&gt; restrict its business to particular localities, or they may exact such security for the performance of its contracts with their citizens as in their judgment will best promote the public interest. The whole matter rests in their discretion." &lt;i&gt;Paul&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Virginia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;168&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 181.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while, some obvious, strictly defined qualifications were made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The only limitation upon this power of the State to exclude a foreign corporation from doing business within its limits . . . or to exact conditions for allowing the corporation to do business or hire offices there, arises where the corporation is in the employ of the federal government, or where its business is strictly commerce, interstate or foreign. The control of such commerce, being in the federal government, is not to be restricted by state authority." &lt;i&gt;Pembina Consolidated Silver Mining &amp;amp; Milling Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pennsylvania,&lt;/i&gt; 125 U. S. 181, 190.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After considerable further judicial experience, the matter was thus summarized in our own day by Mr. Justice Holmes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;". . . we assume in favor of the defendants that the State has the power and constitutional right arbitrarily to exclude the plaintiff without other reason than that such is its will. But it has been held a great many times that the most absolute seeming &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*80&lt;/span&gt; rights are qualified, and in some circumstances become wrong. One of the most frequently recurring instances is when the so-called right is used as part of a scheme to accomplish a forbidden result. &lt;i&gt;Frick&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pennsylvania,&lt;/i&gt; 268 U. S. 473. &lt;i&gt;American Bank &amp;amp; Trust Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta,&lt;/i&gt; 256 U. S. 350, 358. &lt;i&gt;Badders&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 240 U. S. 391, 394. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Reading Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 226 U. S. 324, 357. Thus the right to exclude a foreign corporation cannot be used to prevent it from resorting to a federal court, &lt;i&gt;Terral&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Burke Construction Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 257 U. S. 529; or to tax it upon property that by established principles the State has no power to tax, &lt;i&gt;Western Union Telegraph Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kansas,&lt;/i&gt; 216 U. S. 1, and other cases in the same volume and later that have followed it; or to interfere with interstate commerce, &lt;i&gt;Sioux Remedy Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cope,&lt;/i&gt; 235 U. S. 107 [197], 203; &lt;i&gt;Looney&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Crane Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 245 U. S. 178, 188. &lt;i&gt;Western Union Telegraph Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Foster,&lt;/i&gt; 247 U. S. 105, 114. A State cannot regulate the conduct of a foreign railroad corporation in another jurisdiction, even though the Company has tracks and does business in the State making the attempt. &lt;i&gt;New York, Lake Erie &amp;amp; Western R. R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pennsylvania,&lt;/i&gt; 153 U. S. 628, 646." &lt;i&gt;Fidelity &amp;amp; Deposit Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tafoya,&lt;/i&gt; 270 U. S. 426, 434-435.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a particularization of his earlier generalization in &lt;i&gt;Denver&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Denver Union Water Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 246 U. S. 178:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The ordinance of the City could mean no more than that the Company must accept the City's rates or stop&#151;and as it could be stopped by the City out and out, the general principle is that it could be stopped unless a certain price should be paid. . . . It is true that this principle has not been applied in cases where the condition tended to bring about a state of things that there was a predominant public interest &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*81&lt;/span&gt; to prevent, but I see no ground for the application here of anything to be deduced from &lt;i&gt;Western Union Telegraph Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kansas,&lt;/i&gt; 216 U. S. 1; &lt;i&gt;Pullman Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kansas,&lt;/i&gt; 216 U. S. 56, or &lt;i&gt;Motion Picture Patents Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Universal Film Manufacturing Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 243 U. S. 502." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 197.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upshot of our decisions was most recently thus summarized by Mr. Justice Roberts for the Court:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It has repeatedly been said that qualification of a foreign corporation in accordance with the statutes permitting its entry into the State constitutes an assent on its part to all the reasonable conditions imposed. &lt;i&gt;Lafayette Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;French, supra&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;How.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;], 408; &lt;i&gt;St. Clair&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cox, supra&lt;/i&gt; [106 U. S. 350], 356; &lt;i&gt;Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Spratley,&lt;/i&gt; 172 U. S. 602, 614; &lt;i&gt;Old Wayne Mut. Life Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McDonough,&lt;/i&gt; 204 U. S. 8, 22; &lt;i&gt;Commercial Mutual Accident Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Davis,&lt;/i&gt; 213 U. S. 245, 254. It is true that the corporation's entry may not be conditioned upon surrender of constitutional rights, as was attempted in the cases on which the appellant relies. &lt;i&gt;Terral&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Burke Construction Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 257 U. S. 529; &lt;i&gt;Fidelity &amp;amp; Deposit Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tafoya,&lt;/i&gt; 270 U. S. 426; &lt;i&gt;Frost Trucking Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Railroad Commission,&lt;/i&gt; 271 U. S. 583; &lt;i&gt;Hanover Fire Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Harding,&lt;/i&gt; 272 U. S. 494. And for this reason a State may not exact arbitrary and unreasonable terms respecting suits against foreign corporations as the price of admission, &lt;i&gt;Power Mfg. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Saunders,&lt;/i&gt; 274 U. S. 490. . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The power of the State altogether to exclude the corporation, and the consequent ability to condition its entrance into the State, distinguishes this case from those involving substituted service upon individuals. . . ." &lt;i&gt;Washington&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Superior Court,&lt;/i&gt; 289 U. S. 361, 364-365.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*82&lt;/span&gt; The standard of reasonableness, as expressed in the &lt;i&gt;Washington&lt;/i&gt; case, imposed on the power of a State to admit a foreign corporation on conditions, embraces all prior instances of denial of state power. It gives a rational basis for the holdings that a State may not restrict federal judicial power or burdensomely regulate or tax interstate commerce, or, without justification of ample interests of its own, project its powers into the domain of another State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Louisiana has done here falls outside any of the specific instances or the guiding principles recognized by this Court from time to time as limitations upon what still remains the practically arbitrary power of a State in dealing with the desire of a foreign corporation, not privileged to do so by federal authority, to do business within its bounds.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Here we have no claim of interference with interstate commerce or with the operations of the Federal Government. There is no discrimination between foreign and domestic insurance companies. And there is no denial of due process because the Louisiana condition of admission meets the test of reasonableness, a standard to be applied in diverse contexts in the light of all relevant factors, including here the recognized power to exclude a foreign corporation. It meets the test of reasonableness because the conditions imposed are fairly related to the interests which Louisiana may appropriately protect in surrendering its right to exclude a foreign corporation. The interests of Massachusetts or Illinois do not so obviously &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*83&lt;/span&gt; subordinate those of Louisiana that the latter must constitutionally yield to the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely it was reasonable for Louisiana to adopt the method it did of meeting some of the difficulties in obtaining jurisdiction over out-of-state tortfeasors, typified in the present case by the dispute over the efficacy of attempted service upon Gillette, the insured. Even where that specific problem is not present, the State may justifiably have felt concern over the delays in satisfaction of judgments for injuries sustained in Louisiana by Louisiana citizens that are inherent under the traditional system which requires a separate action by the victim of an insured tortfeasor to reach the latter's insurance should he default in payment of a judgment against him. It cannot be said that Louisiana was extorting an unfair or unreasonable advantage for its citizens as the price of its permission to Employers' to tap the Louisiana insurance market.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; Nor can it be said that in thus protecting its own serious interests it was selfishly or ruthlessly seeking to inject itself into matters that were the sole or predominant concern of sister States.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Title 22, La. Rev. Stat., 1950.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The insurance policy was issued to "The Toni Company, a Division of the Gillette Safety Razor Company . . . ." Gillette is a Delaware Corporation with headquarters in Boston where the contract was negotiated with the Boston office of Employers. The Toni Company manufactures the hair-waving product in Chicago, Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  "12. Action Against Company. No action shall lie against the company unless, as a condition precedent thereto, the insured shall have fully complied with all the terms of this policy, nor until the amount of the insured's obligation to pay shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the insured after actual trial or by written agreement of the insured, the claimant and the company.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Any person or organization or the legal representative thereof who has secured such judgment or written agreement shall thereafter be entitled to recover under this policy to the extent of the insurance afforded by this policy. Nothing contained in this policy shall give any person or organization any right to join the company as a co-defendant in any action against the insured to determine the insured's liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Bankruptcy or insolvency of the insured or of the insured's estate shall not relieve the company of any of its obligations hereunder."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  "The injured person or his or her heirs, at their option, shall have a right of direct action against the insurer within the terms and limits of the policy in the parish where the accident or injury occurred or in the parish where the insured has his domicile, and said action may be brought against the insurer alone or against both the insured and the insurer, jointly and in solido. This right of direct action shall exist whether the policy of insurance sued upon was written or delivered in the State of Louisiana or not and whether or not such policy contains a provision forbidding such direct action, provided the accident or injury occurred within the State of Louisiana.. . . It is the intent of this section that any action brought hereunder shall be subject to all of the lawful conditions of the policy or contract and the defenses which could be urged by the insurer to a direct action brought by the insured, provided the terms and conditions of such policy or contract are not in violation of the laws of this state." La. Rev. Stat., 1950, &#167; 22:655, as amended by Act 541 of the Louisiana Legislature of 1950. As to the scope of this provision according to Louisiana courts, see &lt;i&gt;Rome&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;London &amp;amp; Lancashire Indemnity Co. of America,&lt;/i&gt; La. App., 169 So. 132.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  "No certificate of authority to do business in Louisiana shall be issued to a foreign or alien liability insurer until such insurer shall consent to being sued by the injured person or his or her heirs in a direct action as provided in Section 655 of this title, whether the policy of insurance sued upon was written or delivered in the State of Louisiana or not, and whether or not such policy contains a provision forbidding such direct action, provided that the accident or injury occurred within the State of Louisiana. The said foreign or alien insurer shall deliver to the Secretary of State as a condition precedent to the issuance of such authority, an instrument evidencing such consent." La. Rev. Stat., 1950, &#167; 22:983, as amended by Act 542 of the Louisiana Legislature of 1950.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  The District Court relied in part on its prior opinions in &lt;i&gt;Mayo&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Zurich General Accident &amp;amp; Liability Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 106 F. Supp. 579; &lt;i&gt;Bayard&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Traders &amp;amp; General Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 99 F. Supp. 343; &lt;i&gt;Bish&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Employers' Liability Assurance Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 102 F. Supp. 343.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  28 U. S. C. &#167; 1254 (2). In addition to noting probable jurisdiction of this cause, we granted certiorari. 347 U. S. 958. Since the case is properly here on appeal, the certiorari is dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Additional protections to both insurer and insured are swept aside under the Louisiana direct action statute. The interest of the insured in the outcome of the litigation decreases, with concomitant reduction in the likelihood of his vigorous cooperation in the insurer's defense. The burden of this same obligation of cooperation becomes increasingly oppressive to a conscientious insured as service on farflung agents of the insurer leads to remote judicial proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  An earlier case expressed, in a jumble of loose generalizations, the assumption that there were some inherent restrictions on a State's power to deal with foreign corporations. &lt;i&gt;Lafayette Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;French,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;How.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 407. Phrases like "natural justice" or "natural reason" or "the principles of the social compact" were in fashion at that time for stating intrinsic limitations on the exercise of all political power. More recently, the power of this Court to strike down legislation has been more acutely analyzed and less loosely expressed. Rhetorical generalizations have not been deemed sufficient justification for invalidating legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Whatever the survival value of &lt;i&gt;Frost &amp;amp; Frost Trucking Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Railroad Comm'n,&lt;/i&gt; 271 U. S. 583, cf. &lt;i&gt;Stephenson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Binford,&lt;/i&gt; 287 U. S. 251, it is significant that, while it was there held that to subject a private carrier to a common carrier's liabilities as a condition of permitting a local trucking company to use the highways was violative of due process, the opinion did not even advert to the earlier case of &lt;i&gt;Pierce Oil Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Phoenix Rfg. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 259 U. S. 125, in which the imposition of a common carrier's liabilities on a private oil carrier was upheld as a condition on the entry of the foreign corporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Thus it has been held that a State may, as a condition of admission, require compliance with local antitrust policy, &lt;i&gt;Waters-Pierce Oil Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Texas,&lt;/i&gt; 177 U. S. 28, even as to the operations of foreign corporations in another State, &lt;i&gt;Hammond Packing Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arkansas,&lt;/i&gt; 212 U. S. 322. It may require the assumption by a private carrier of some of the duties of a common carrier, &lt;i&gt;Pierce Oil Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Phoenix Rfg. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 259 U. S. 125; and it may impose methods of substituted service on foreign corporations which, if applied to individuals, would be violative of due process, &lt;i&gt;Washington&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Superior Court,&lt;/i&gt; 289 U. S. 361.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  Such cases as &lt;i&gt;St. Louis Cotton Compress Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arkansas,&lt;/i&gt; 260 U. S. 346, and &lt;i&gt;Fidelity &amp;amp; Deposit Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tafoya,&lt;/i&gt; 270 U. S. 426, invalidating state statutes which attempted to prevent or penalize acts outside of the forum State are not pertinent. In these cases a State was seeking to assert its power over the happenings in another State. And so, likewise, a State may not tax property within the taxing jurisdiction of another State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;No. 33.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued November 16, 1954.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided January 10, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Charles K. Rice&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Holland, Ellis N. Slack, A. F. Prescott&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fred E. Youngman.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Francis B. Kavanagh&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for Oravitz, respondent. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Israel Freeman.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE MINTON delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case involves the relative priority between an attachment lien and the liens of the United States for unpaid taxes. The District Court found the attachment &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*212&lt;/span&gt; lien prior to the liens of the United States, and the Court of Appeals affirmed without opinion. We granted certiorari, 347 U. S. 973.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 11, 1948, the United States filed suit in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio to collect unpaid income taxes for the years 1942-1946 against one Acri and his wife. Acri was at the time in the penitentiary for the murder of one Oravec, whose personal representative, Oravitz, had, on August 6, 1947, in Mahoning County, Ohio, filed an action against Acri for wrongful death. On the same date, certain cash and bonds of Acri, which were in his safety deposit box in the Dollar Savings and Trust Company, were attached by Oravitz. The box was not opened until September 11, 1948, after the bank had been made guardian of Acri, at which time an inventory was filed. The personal representative, Oravitz, and the bank, as guardian of Acri, were made parties to the Government's suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 19, 1949, the personal representative of the murdered man recovered judgment against Acri in the sum of $18,500. In the meantime, on November 18, 1947, after the issuance of the writ of attachment, but more than a year before the judgment in the main action for wrongful death, the assessment lists for unpaid income taxes of Acri and his wife for the years 1942-1946 were received in the office of the Collector of Internal Revenue. On November 19, 1947, demand for payment was mailed to Acri. On November 21, 1947, a notice of the tax liens was filed in the office of the Recorder in Mahoning County, Ohio, which is the residence of the defendants and the location of the Acris' property, and the place where the action for wrongful death was begun. Notice and levy of the tax liens were served upon the Dollar Bank. It was stipulated that the only question involved was the relative priority of the attachment lien of the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*213&lt;/span&gt; personal representative and the tax liens of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue here is identical with that in &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Security Trust Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 340 U. S. 47. There the question was stated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The question presented here is whether a tax lien of the United States is prior in right to an attachment lien where the federal tax lien was recorded subsequent to the date of the attachment lien but prior to the date the attaching creditor obtained judgment." 340 U. S., at 48.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our answer here is the same as in the &lt;i&gt;Security Trust Company&lt;/i&gt; case and for the same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relative priority of the lien of the United States for unpaid taxes is, as we said in &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Waddill Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 323 U. S. 353, 356, 357; &lt;i&gt;Illinois&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Campbell,&lt;/i&gt; 329 U. S. 362, 371; &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Security Trust Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 340 U. S. 47, 49, always a federal question to be determined finally by the federal courts. The state's characterization of its liens, while good for all state purposes, does not necessarily bind this Court. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Waddill Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 323 U. S. 353, at 357; &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gilbert Associates,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 361. Therefore, the fact that the Ohio courts had designated an attachment lien "an execution in advance," &lt;i&gt;Rempe &amp;amp; Son&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ravens,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;68&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ohio St.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;113&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 67 N. E. 282, and treated it as a perfected lien at the time of attachment, does not bind this Court. We must look at the circumstances as we did in the &lt;i&gt;Waddill&lt;/i&gt; case, where he Virginia court had held a landlord's lien was fixed, specific, and not inchoate. This Court, after examining the facts, found otherwise. In &lt;i&gt;Gilbert Associates,&lt;/i&gt; the New Hampshire court had held that the assessment of a tax was a judgment and the United States' lien for taxes was not valid against the tax assessment made by the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*214&lt;/span&gt; town within the meaning of &#167; 3672 of the Internal Revenue Code.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; We held that although New Hampshire might treat its tax assessments as judgments for state purposes, the assessment of the tax was not a judgment within the meaning of &#167; 3672. We hold here that the attachment lien in Ohio is for federal tax purposes an inchoate lien because, at the time the attachment issued, the fact and the amount of the lien were contingent upon the outcome of the suit for damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In argument it was pointed out that the statute of California involved in the &lt;i&gt;Security Trust&lt;/i&gt; case was different because California courts had held an attachment lien to be inchoate and a mere notice of a more perfect lien to come, while Ohio courts had held it to be an execution in advance and a lien perfected as of the time of attachment. This distinction is immaterial for purposes of federal law. This case is not to be distinguished from &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Security Trust Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 340 U. S. 47, and the judgment is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]  "Such lien shall not be valid as against any mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser, or judgment creditor until notice thereof has been filed by the collector . . ." etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Argued November 16, 1954.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided January 10, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Charles K. Rice&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Holland, Ellis N. Slack, A. F. Prescott&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fred E. Youngman.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Searcy L. Johnson&lt;/i&gt; for the Liverpool &amp;amp; London &amp;amp; Globe Insurance Co., Ltd., and &lt;i&gt;Arthur S. Goldberg&lt;/i&gt; for the Sunnyland Wholesale Furniture Co., respondents, submitted on briefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE MINTON delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a case involving priority of federal tax liens and a lien of garnishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 8, 1952, fire destroyed certain property of Adams, engaged in a furniture business in Temple, Bell County, Texas. Respondent insurance company and another were the insurers. The insurance companies agreed on the amount of the loss, and they were to share &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*216&lt;/span&gt; the payment equally. Before the insurance money was paid, a creditor of Adams, the Sunnyland Wholesale Furniture Company, on April 8, 1952, sued Adams on an open account. At the same time, a writ of garnishment was issued and served upon the Liverpool &amp;amp; London &amp;amp; Globe Insurance Company, attaching the insurance funds due and owing Adams. On April 21, 1952, the assessment lists covering the unpaid federal taxes of Adams and his wife for 1948 and 1950 were received in the office of the Collector of Internal Revenue for Texas. On April 26, 1952, notice of tax liens was filed in the office of the county clerk of Bell County, Texas, in favor of the United States for $10,417.57, with interest. Notice of the tax liens with warrants of distraint and notice of levy were served on the respondent insurance company. On June 20, 1952, judgment was entered against Adams in favor of Sunnyland for $2,516.70, with interest and costs. When the garnishee, the respondent insurance company, answered, it named the United States an additional party defendant and requested a determination of priorities of the garnisher and the United States, and asked for reasonable attorney's fees. The amendment was allowed, and the United States was served with process to appear in the state court. On petition of the United States the inter-pleader action was removed to the Northern District of Texas, and the United States was dismissed as a party defendant and permitted to file its complaint for foreclosure of its tax liens. The respondent insurance company paid $7,500.39 into the registry of the court and asked for an attorney's fee of $500. The District Court held the lien of the garnisher superior to the liens of the United States for taxes and allowed the garnishee $500 for attorney's fees. 107 F. Supp. 405. The Court of Appeals affirmed, one judge dissenting. 209 F. 2d 684. We granted certiorari, 347 U. S. 973.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*217&lt;/span&gt; The question of priorities is identical with that of &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Acri, ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 211, and &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Security Trust Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 340 U. S. 47. On the authority of those cases we hold the tax liens of the United States superior to the lien of the garnisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to the attorney's fee allowed the garnishee insurance company, Rule 677, Vernon's Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Where the garnishee is discharged upon his answer, the costs of the proceeding, including a reasonable compensation to the garnishee, shall be taxed against the plaintiff; where the answer of the garnishee has not been controverted and the garnishee is held thereon, such costs shall be taxed against the defendant and included in the execution provided for in this section; where the answer is contested, the costs shall abide the issue of such contest."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Court evidently found there was no contest between the insurance company and the other parties, and that the insurance company should be discharged with costs and allowance of a reasonable attorney's fee of $500. It, therefore, ordered the clerk to issue a check to the insurance company, payable out of the funds paid into the court by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the garnishment lien is not prior to the Government liens, and we have held that it is not, certainly fees allowed in that proceeding are not prior to the Government liens, and the authorization of the payment of the attorney's fees prior to the Government liens was error. The costs and fees should be adjudged against the defendant, as provided by Rule 677.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE&lt;br&gt;
v.&lt;br&gt;
ESTATE OF STERNBERGER, CHASE NATIONAL BANK OF NEW YORK, EXECUTOR.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;No. 24.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued October 19-20, 1954.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided January 10, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Melva M. Graney&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With her on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Holland, Ellis N. Slack&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Robert N. Anderson.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Edward S. Greenbaum&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Maurice C. Greenbaum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Charles E. Heming.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue here is whether, in determining a net estate for federal estate tax purposes, a deduction may be made on account of a charitable bequest that is to take effect &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*188&lt;/span&gt; only if decedent's childless 27-year-old daughter dies without descendants surviving her and her mother. For the reasons hereafter stated, we hold that it may not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louis Sternberger died testate June 25, 1947. His federal estate tax return discloses a gross estate of $2,406,541.71 and, for the additional estate tax, a net estate of $2,064,346.55. It includes assets owned by him at his death and others held by the Chase National Bank, respondent herein, under a revocable trust created by him. As the revocable trust makes provisions for charity that are, for our purposes, identical with those in the will, this opinion applies to both dispositions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The will places the residuary estate in trust during the joint lives of decedent's wife and daughter and for the life of the survivor of them. Upon the death of such survivor, the principal of the trust fund is payable to the then living descendants of the daughter. However, if there are no such descendants, one-half of the residue goes to certain collateral relatives of decedent and the other half to certain charitable corporations. If none of the designated relatives are living, the entire residue goes to the charitable corporations.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At decedent's death, his wife and daughter survived him. His wife was then 62 and his daughter 27. The latter married in 1942, was divorced in 1944, had not remarried and had not had a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the estate tax return, decedent's executor, respondent herein, deducted $179,154.19 from the gross estate as the present value of the conditional bequest to charity of one-half of the residue. Respondent claimed no deduction for the more remote charitable bequest of the other half of the residue. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the deduction and determined a tax &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*189&lt;/span&gt; deficiency on that ground. The Tax Court reversed the Commissioner. 18 T. C. 836. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the Tax Court, 207 F. 2d 600, on the authority of &lt;i&gt;Meierhof&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Higgins,&lt;/i&gt; 129 F. 2d 1002. To resolve the resulting conflict with the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in &lt;i&gt;Newton Trust Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 160 F. 2d 175, we granted certiorari, 347 U. S. 932.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controlling provisions of the Revenue Code are in substantially the same terms as when they were first enacted in 1919&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; and are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"SEC. 812. NET ESTATE.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"For the purpose of the tax the value of the net estate shall be determined . . . by deducting from the value of the gross estate&#151;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;.....&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(d) TRANSFERS FOR PUBLIC, CHARITABLE, AND RELIGIOUS USES.&#151;The amount of all bequests, legacies, devises, or transfers . . . to or for the use of any corporation organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes . . . ." I. R. C.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commissioner concedes that the corporations named in the will qualify as charitable corporations under the statute. There is no doubt, therefore, that if the bequest to them had been immediate and unconditional, its value would be deductible. The question before us is what, if any, charitable deduction may be made despite (1) the deferment of the effective date of the charitable bequest until the deaths of both decedent's wife and daughter and (2) the conditioning of the bequest upon a lack of descendants of decedent's daughter surviving &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*190&lt;/span&gt; at that time. We find the answer in the Treasury Regulations, which are of long standing and strengthened by reenactments of I. R. C., &#167; 812 (d), since their promulgation.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;i&gt;Section 81.44 of Treasury Regulations 105 would permit the deduction of the present value of the bequest if it were an outright bequest, merely deferred until the deaths of decedent's wife and daughter.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their earliest form, the predecessors of these regulations, in 1919, recognized, in plain language, the propriety of the deduction of the present value of a deferred, but assured, bequest to charity.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; Section 81.44 (d) of Treasury Regulations 105 does so with inescapable specificity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"&#167; 81.44 &lt;i&gt;Transfers for public, charitable, religious, etc., uses.&lt;/i&gt; . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;.....&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(d) If a trust is created for both a charitable and a private purpose, deduction may be taken of the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*191&lt;/span&gt; value of the beneficial interest in favor of the former only insofar as such interest is presently ascertainable, and hence severable from the interest in favor of the private use. &#167; 81.10 indicates the principles to be applied in the computation of the present worth of deferred uses, but such computation will not be made by the Commissioner on behalf of the executor. &lt;i&gt;Thus, if money or property is placed in trust to pay the income to an individual during his life, or for a term of years, and then to pay or deliver the principal to the charitable corporation, or to apply it to a charitable purpose, the present value of the remainder is deductible.&lt;/i&gt; To determine the present value of such remainder, use the appropriate factor in column 3 of Table A or B of &#167; 81.10. &lt;i&gt;If the present worth of a remainder bequeathed for a charitable use is dependent upon the termination of more than one life, or in any other manner rendering inapplicable Table A or B of&lt;/i&gt; &#167; &lt;i&gt;81.10, the claim for the deduction must be supported by a full statement, in duplicate, of the computation of the present worth made, in accordance with the principle set forth in&lt;/i&gt; &#167; &lt;i&gt;81.10, by one skilled in actuarial computations.&lt;/i&gt;" (Emphasis supplied.) 26 CFR.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very explicitness of the above provisions emphasizes their restriction to "the computation of the present worth" of &lt;i&gt;assured&lt;/i&gt; bequests such as are the subject of each of the illustrations and cross references in the section. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*192&lt;/span&gt; The statute restricts charitable deductions to bequests to corporations "organized and &lt;i&gt;operated exclusively&lt;/i&gt; for. . . charitable . . . purposes."&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; (Emphasis supplied.) Likewise, the above section of the regulations requires that the deductible value of "the beneficial interest in favor of" the designated charitable purpose be "severable from the interest in favor of the private use." There is no suggestion in the statute or in &#167; 81.44 of a deduction of funds other than those later to be used exclusively for charitable purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;i&gt;Section 81.46 of Treasury Regulations 105 permits no deduction for a conditional bequest to charity "unless the possibility that charity will not take is so remote as to be negligible."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, also, the regulations in their earliest form, in 1919, were unequivocally restrictive.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; It was only after court &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*193&lt;/span&gt; decisions had demonstrated the need for doing so&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; that the restrictions were restated so as expressly to permit deductions of bequests assured in fact but conditional in form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 81.46 now provides expressly that no deduction is allowable for a conditional bequest to charity "unless the possibility that charity will not take is so remote as to be negligible." The whole section is significant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"&#167; 81.46 &lt;i&gt;Conditional bequests.&lt;/i&gt; (a) &lt;i&gt;If as of the date of decedent's death the transfer to charity is dependent upon the performance of some act or the happening of a precedent event in order that it might become effective, no deduction is allowable unless the possibility that charity will not take is so remote as to be negligible.&lt;/i&gt; If an estate or interest has passed to or is vested in charity at the time of decedent's death and such right or interest would be defeated by the performance of some act or the happening of some event which appeared to have been highly improbable at the time of decedent's death, the deduction is allowable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(b) If the legatee, devise, donee, or trustee is empowered to divert the property or fund, in whole or in part, to a use or purpose which would have rendered it, to the extent that it is subject to such power, not deductible had it been directly so bequeathed, devised, or given by the decedent, deduction will be limited to that portion, if any, of the property or fund which is exempt from an exercise of such power." (Emphasis supplied.) 26 CFR.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sections 81.44 and 81.46 fully implement &#167; 812 (d) of the code. In their early forms they were obviously mutually &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*194&lt;/span&gt; exclusive and easily reconcilable. The predecessor of &#167; 81.46 confined charitable deductions to outright, unconditional bequests to charity. It expressly excluded deductions for charitable bequests that were subject to conditions, either precedent or subsequent. While it encouraged assured bequests to charity, it offered no deductions for bequests that might never reach charity. Subsequent amendments have clarified and not changed that principle. Section 81.46 (a) today yields to no condition unless the possibility that charity will not take is "negligible" or "highly improbable." Section 81.46 (b) is equally strict. It relates to provisions whereby funds may be diverted in whole or in part to noncharitable uses, and it limits the tax deduction to that portion of each fund that cannot be so diverted. Where the principal of a bequest to charity thus may be invaded for private purposes, it is only the ascertainable and assured balance of the bequest to charity that is recognized for a tax deduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent concedes that the chance that charity will not take is much more than negligible. Therefore, if &#167; 81.46 (a) applies to the instant case, no charitable deduction is permissible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent claims, however, that &#167; 81.44 covers this case. In doing so, it reads &#167;&#167; 81.44 and 81.46 together and, instead of confining them to their mutually exclusive subjects, makes them overlap. It applies &#167; 81.44 to some deferred &lt;i&gt;conditional&lt;/i&gt; bequests. It does so in any case where it can compute, on approved actuarial standards, the degree of possibility that charity will receive the conditional bequest. Respondent then computes the present value of a corresponding percentage of the entire deferred bequest. In short, respondent claims an immediate tax deduction equal to the present value of whatever fraction of the bequest corresponds, actuarially, to the chance that charity may benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*195&lt;/span&gt; This Court considered a somewhat comparable proposal in 1928. In &lt;i&gt;Humes&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 276 U. S. 487, a taxpayer sought a charitable deduction based on a bequest to charity that was conditional upon the death of decedent's 15-year-old niece, without issue, before reaching the age of 40. To sustain the proposal, the taxpayer sought to establish actuarially a measure of the chance that charity would receive the bequest and to find authority in the Revenue Code for the deduction of the present value of a corresponding percentage of the bequest. Speaking through Mr. Justice Brandeis, this Court found the actuarial computation inadequate. It, however, did not drop the matter there. It made the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"One may guess, or gamble on, or even insure against, any future event. The Solicitor General tells us that Lloyds of London will insure against having twins. But the fundamental question in the case at bar, is not whether this contingent interest can be insured against or its value guessed at, but what construction shall be given to a statute. Did Congress in providing for the determination of the net estate taxable, intend that a deduction should be made for a contingency, the &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; value of which cannot be determined from any known data? Neither taxpayer, nor revenue officer&#151;&lt;i&gt;even if equipped with all the aid which the actuarial art can supply&lt;/i&gt;&#151;could do more than guess at the value of this contingency. &lt;i&gt;It is clear that Congress did not intend that a deduction should be made for a contingent gift of that character.&lt;/i&gt;" (Emphasis supplied.) &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 494.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the above was written, there have been advances in the actuarial art. Today, actuarial estimates are employed more widely than they were then. The computations &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*196&lt;/span&gt; now before us illustrate that advance. They do not, however, lesson the necessity for statutory authorization for such a tax deduction. The scope of the authority required by respondent can best be appreciated if examined in the revealing light of the specific circumstances of the present case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tax Court and the Court of Appeals have approved respondent's actuarial computations as fairly reflecting the present value of one-half of a two-million-dollar residue, reduced in proportion to the chance that charity will receive it. In making this estimate, respondent has computed the present value of the deferred bequest on the basis of 4% interest compounded annually and has used the following actuarial tables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. To determine the joint life expectancy of decedent's wife and daughter, the Combined Experience Mortality Table prescribed in &#167; 81.10 of the estate tax regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. To estimate the probability of remarriage of the daughter, the American Remarriage Table, published by the Casualty Actuarial Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. To estimate the chance of a first child being born to decedent's daughter a specially devised table which has been found by the Tax Court to have been prepared in accordance with accepted actuarial principles upon data derived from statistics published by the Bureau of the Census.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*197&lt;/span&gt; On the basis of these tables, the Tax Court finds that the present value of the charitable remainder at the death of decedent is .18384 on the dollar if computed solely on the chances of his daughter's remarriage;.24094 on the dollar if computed on the chance that a legitimate descendant of his daughter will survive her; and .24058 on the dollar if computed on the chance that any legitimate or illegitimate descendant of his daughter will survive her. It is this last estimate that respondent seeks to apply here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If respondent is successful, it means the allowance of an immediate and irrevocable deduction of over $175,000 from the gross estate of decedent, although respondent admits there is a real possibility that charity will receive nothing. The bequest in fact, offers to the daughter an inducement of about $2,000,000 to remarry and leave a descendant. To the extent that this inducement reduces the actuarially computed average probability that charity will receive this bequest, it further demonstrates the inappropriateness of authorizing charitable tax deductions based upon highly conditional bequests to charity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An even clearer illustration of the effect of respondent's interpretation of the code readily suggests itself. If &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*198&lt;/span&gt; decedent had here conditioned his bequest to charity solely on the death of his daughter before remarriage, the Remarriage Table would then fix the present value of the charitable remainder at .18384 on the dollar. The taxpayer would at once receive a substantial charitable deduction on that basis. The daughter, however, would have a $2,000,000 inducement to remarry. If she did so, her action would cancel the possibility that charity would receive anything from the bequest, but it would not cancel the tax seduction already allowed to the estate. To whatever extent any person can defeat the fulfillment of any condition upon which a benefit to charity depends, to that extent the actuarial estimate that such benefit will reach charity is less dependable. The allowance of such a tax reduction as is here sought would open a door to easy abuse. The result might well be not so much to encourage gifts inuring to the benefit of charity as to encourage the writing of conditions into bequests which would assure charitable tax deductions without assuring benefits to charity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find no suggestion of authority for such a deduction in &#167; 812 (d). That section remains substantially the same as it was when &lt;i&gt;Humes&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, supra,&lt;/i&gt; 276 U. S. 487, was decided. We also find no authorization for the deduction wither in &#167; 81.46 or &#167; 81.44 of the regulations, as thus far discussed. This relegates respondent to the following words now in &#167; 81.44 (d):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If the present worth of a remainder bequeathed for a charitable use is dependent upon the termination of more than one life, or &lt;i&gt;in any other manner rendering inapplicable Table A or B of&lt;/i&gt; &#167; &lt;i&gt;81.10,&lt;/i&gt; the claim for the deduction must be supported by a full statement, in duplicate, of the computation of the present worth made, in accordance with the principle set forth in &#167; 81.10, by one skilled in actuarial computations." (Emphasis supplied.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*199&lt;/span&gt; In view of the statutory emphasis upon outright bequests and the long-standing exclusion of conditional bequests by &#167; 81.46 of the regulations (and its predecessors), we do not regard the above sentence as now invading the domain of &#167; 81.46 by extending the deduction to conditional bequests in a manner readily open to abuse. we regard the sentence as restricted to computations of deferred but assured, bequests. Section 81.10 (i) now deals at length with the valuation of remainders and reversionary interests and gives many examples of such computations. Every example, however, is one of the valuation of an assured bequest. The additional language in &#167; 81.44 (d), quoted above, does not authorize the deduction, and &#167; 81.46 prohibits it. Such specific and established administrative interpretation of the statute is valid and "should not be overruled except for weighty reasons." &lt;i&gt;Commissioner&lt;/i&gt; v, &lt;i&gt;South Texas Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 333 U. S. 496, 501.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Court has not specifically faced the issue now before us since &lt;i&gt;Humes&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; but we see no reason to retreat from the views there stated. This Court finds no statutory authority for the deduction from a gross estate of any percentage of a conditional bequest to charity where there is no assurance that charity will receive the bequest or some determinable part of it. Where the amount of a bequest to charity has not been determinable, the deduction properly has been denied. &lt;i&gt;Henslee&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Union Planters Bank,&lt;/i&gt; 335 U. S. 595, 598-600; &lt;i&gt;Merchants Bank&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 320 U. S. 256, 259-263; and see &lt;i&gt;Robinette&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Helvering,&lt;/i&gt; 318 U. S. 184, 189. Where the amount has been determinable the deduction has, with equal propriety, been allowed where the designated charity has been sure to benefit from it. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Provident Trust Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 291 U. S. 272; &lt;i&gt;Ithaca Trust Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 279 U. S. 151.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the lower courts have squarely met the instant problem and denied the deduction. For example, the deduction &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*200&lt;/span&gt; was denied in the First Circuit where the court found that "it is not certain that the charity will takes 50% of the corpus; only that it has a 50-50 chance of getting all or nothing." &lt;i&gt;Newton Trust Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 160 F. 2d 175, 181. See also, &lt;i&gt;Graff&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Smith,&lt;/i&gt; 100 F. Supp. 42; &lt;i&gt;Hoagland&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kavanagh,&lt;/i&gt; 36 F. Supp. 875; &lt;i&gt;Wood&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 20 F. Supp. 197. The administrative practice, as evidenced here by the action of the Commissioner, has been to deny the deduction. See further, Paul, Federal Estate and Gift Taxation (1946 Supp.), 426-427.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is reversed and the cause remanded for action in conformity with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE REED, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facts are fully and fairly stated in the Court's opinion. Its statement of the legal issues accords with our understanding of the case, to wit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The question before us is what, if any, charitable deduction may be made despite (1) the deferment of the effective date of the charitable bequest until the deaths of both decedent's wife and daughter and (2) the conditioning of the bequest upon a lack of descendants of decedent's daughter surviving at that time."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for dissenting, at some length, is that the Court's conclusion seems to disregard the words of the statute in question and to subvert the purpose of Congress in its enactment, that purpose admittedly being to encourage testamentary gifts to corporations organized for certain objects considered highly desirable for the good of our people.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; There is a certain hesitation in dissenting &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*201&lt;/span&gt; from an interpretation of a tax statute remediable by Congress, but as the Court's decision springs, we think, from an overemphasis on regulations, a protest may have usefulness as a counterweight against future extensions of such treatment to statutory language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;First.&lt;/i&gt; The statute, 26 U. S. C. &#167; 812 (d), allows as deductions from the gross estate the "amount of all bequests, legacies, devises, or transfers . . . to or for the use of any corporation organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes . . . ." There is no legislative history explanatory of its meaning.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; If we read the quoted portion of &#167; 812 alone, could there be any doubt that the Sternberger bequest is deductible? We think not. It says "all bequests"&#151;whatever the charity takes under the will. There is not a word that limits the deduction of bequests to what assuredly goes to the institution. It is the "amount" of the bequest that is deductible&#151;its presently ascertainable value. The statute plainly allows deferred charitable bequests. It does not require assured enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Court's interpretation, if a child were bequeathed his father's estate for life with remainder in default of issue to the recognized institutions, the full estate tax would have to be paid. On the other hand, if the estate were left simply to the child for life and then to the same institutions, the estate would be free from the tax on the present value of the remainder. Such a differentiation is not found in the statute. The Congress said that charitable bequests should be deductible. The valuation of the charitable interest in one instance would be greater than in the other; the tax less. But in each case the net estate would be reduced only by the present actuarial value of the charitable bequest. While particular &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*202&lt;/span&gt; estates would secure tax advantages under our interpretation, in the aggregate the charitable deductions should substantially equal the amount received by the tax-recognized institutions. This would surely fairly carry out the congressional purpose. To view respondent's contention as urging a possible over-all tax windfall for estates is to deny the mathematical law of averages.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our interpretation of the statute has support in the language of Treasury Regulation 105, &#167; 81.44. After referring to the valuation of bequests whose value is presently ascertainable, the regulation adds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If the present worth of a remainder bequeathed for a charitable use is dependent upon the termination of more than one life, or in any other manner rendering inapplicable Table A or B of &#167; 81.10, the claim for the deduction must be supported by a full statement, in duplicate, of the computation of the present worth made, in accordance with the principle set forth in &#167; 81.10, by one skilled in actuarial computations."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tables refer to a remainder contingent on the termination of one life only. Section 81.44 alone would allow, in the light of the statutory language, a deduction for a contingent bequest, uncertain as to ultimate receipt. See the Court's opinion, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; pp. 198 and 199. The Court does not follow this language of the Regulations because of &#167; 81.46 and because of "statutory emphasis upon &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*203&lt;/span&gt; outright bequests." We find no such emphasis. The purpose of the statute leads us to the contrary result.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court agrees, however, with the Government's contention that "it is immaterial whether the charity's contingent possibility of receipt can be valued as of the decedent's death." It holds that it is only when ultimate receipt must follow that &#167; 812 (d) allows a deduction. Although the Government asserts its conclusion is upheld by our decisions, we do not think they so hold. In this Court five cases have touched upon the problem. Three of them were disposed of because of the failure to introduce, or the impossibility of making, a valuation upon sound actuarial principles.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; None of them held that bequests are not deductible although the ultimate taking by the charitable beneficiary was uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two&#151;&lt;i&gt;Ithaca Trust Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 279 U. S. 151, and &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Provident Trust Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 291 U. S. 272&#151; allowed a deduction for conditional charitable bequests. The former because a right to invade the corpus was fixed by a standard capable of being stated in money and, as the income of the estate was ample for the needs of the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*204&lt;/span&gt; life beneficiary, there was no uncertainty sufficient to justify a refusal of the deduction for the charitable remainder. The latter is, on its face, a decision that would decide the issue, simplicity, of the deducibility of contingent bequests. Neither is here controlling, however, since in both the charity was held to be assured of taking. The &lt;i&gt;Provident Trust&lt;/i&gt; case is worth a moment's examination. Property was left by will in trust for the deceased's daughter for life; upon her death the corpus was to pass to her lawful issue; but should she die without issue, the estate was to be distributed among various charitable organizations. Prior to the death of the testator, an operation had rendered the daughter incapable of childbearing, assuring the vesting of the charitable remainder. This Court did not apply the then existing regulations (the predecessor to &#167; 81.46 (d))&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; which would have denied a deduction. It ignored the regulation, apparently believing it in conflict with the purpose of the statute, and allows the deduction, thus requiring the amendment of the regulation to its present form. The Court stated the relevant inquiry to be follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The sole question to be considered is&#151;What is the value of the interest to be saved from the tax? That is a practical question, not concluded by the presumption invoked but to be determined by ascertaining in terms of money what the property constituting that interest would bring in the market, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*205&lt;/span&gt; subject to such uncertainty as ordinarily attaches to such an inquiry. See &lt;i&gt;Ithaca Trust Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; . . ." 291 U. S., at 286.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our conclusion is that the purpose of &#167; 812 was to allow a deduction for charitable bequests that are capable of valuation at the time of death, although it is not certain that the gift will ultimately fall to the contingent beneficiary. See in accord &lt;i&gt;Meierhof&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Higgins,&lt;/i&gt; 129 F. 2d 1002, a case in conflict with &lt;i&gt;Newton Trust Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 160 F. 2d 175, which ultimately led to the allowance of this certiorari. The purpose of &#167; 812 and its background forbid, we think, a conclusion that Congress intended to exclude a deduction in those cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Second.&lt;/i&gt; The Government asserts and this Court agrees that although it is clear that &#167; 812 allows a deduction for some contingent bequests, &#167; 81.46 of the regulations limits those contingencies to instances where the "possibility that charity will not take is so remote as to be negligible." Clearly the possibility here is not "remote." The chances are against the charity taking. It is quite true that &#167; 81.46 has survived reenactment of I. R. C., &#167; 812, and that it can be interpreted as a limitation upon the deducibility of contingent remainders. However, we do not think such a ruling would be consistent with the purpose of Congress, manifested by I. R. C., &#167; 812.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the Regulations are written into the Estate Tax law by reenactment or are merely indicative of congressional purpose,&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; the deduction section and the regulations are to be interpreted in the light of the congressional purpose. Whether may be the varying views as to the desirability of testamentary gifts of moneys or business &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*206&lt;/span&gt; to public or private charitable foundations, congress has sanctioned such provisions, vested or with certain degrees of contingency, by the deduction section of the Estate Tax.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; The policy has brought munificent gifts to the chosen institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it were not for the reenactment of &#167; 812 after the promulgation of &#167; 81.46, we would have no hesitation in declaring it in conflict with the statute. Even in interpreting statutes when isolated provisions would produce results "plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole," we follow the purpose rather than the literal words. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Trucking Assns.,&lt;/i&gt; 310 U. S. 534, 543. That rule is applicable here. Regulations do not have the safeguards of federal statutory enactments. Interested parties outside the Internal Revenue Service perhaps may not be heard. Reports explaining the action are not available. Public discussion, such as happens in Congress, does not take place. In short, we think that reenactment of a statute after the due adoption of a regulation does not make the regulation a part of the statute. It is only an indication of congressional purpose to be weighed in the context and circumstances of the statutory language. In this instance the congressional purpose to encourage gifts to charity should not be frustrated by the issuance of a regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the foregoing reasons we would affirm the judgment of the Second Circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  These provisions appear mote fully in &lt;i&gt;Estate of Sternberger&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 18 T. C. 836, 837-838.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Originally &#167; 403 (a) (3) of the Revenue Act of 1918, 49 Stat. 1098. See also, Griswold, Cases and Materials on Federal Taxation (3d ed.), 679 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; 1 Paul, Federal Estate and Gift Taxation, 638 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Its latest reenactment is in &#167; 2055 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 68A Stat. 390. The purpose of the deduction is to encourage gifts to the named uses. &lt;i&gt;Edwards&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Slocum,&lt;/i&gt; 264 U. S. 61, 63; 13 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 198, 201; 28 Va. L. Rev. 387-388. Like other tax deductions, however, it must rest on more than a doubt or ambiguity. See &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Stewart,&lt;/i&gt; 311 U. S. 60, 71, and also &lt;i&gt;Commissioner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jacobson,&lt;/i&gt; 336 U. S. 28, 49.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 408 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 949, added to I. R. C., &#167; 812 (d), the so-called "disclaimer provision," whereby, under certain conditions, the renunciation of a private bequest which effectuates a gift to charity earns a charitable deduction from the decedent's gross estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  "ART. 53. Public, charitable, and similar bequest.&#151;. . . It does not prevent seduction . . . that the property placed in trust is also subject to another trust for a private purpose. Thus, where money or property is placed in trust to pay the income to an individual during life, and then to pay or deliver the same to a charitable corporation, or apply the principal to a charitable purpose, the charitable bequest or devise forms the basis for a deduction. The amount of the deduction, in such case, is the value, at the date of the decedent's death, of the remainder interest in the money or property which is devised or bequeathed to charity. For the manner of determining the value of such remainder interest, see Article 20." 21 T. D. 783-784.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 20 prescribed methods of determining the present worth of a remainder subject to a single life interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  Congressional insistence upon the actual use of the funds &lt;i&gt;exclusively&lt;/i&gt; for charitable purposes appears in the following provisions describing the bequest that are deductible:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The amount of all bequests . . . to or for the use of any corporation organized and &lt;i&gt;operated exclusively&lt;/i&gt; for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes . . . &lt;i&gt;no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual&lt;/i&gt;. . . or to a trustee or trustees, or a fraternal society, order, or association operating under the lodge system, but &lt;i&gt;only if&lt;/i&gt; such contributions or gifts are to be &lt;i&gt;used&lt;/i&gt; . . . &lt;i&gt;exclusively&lt;/i&gt; for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes . . . ." (Emphasis supplied.) I. R. C., &#167; 812 (d).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  "ART. 56. Conditional bequests.&#151;Where the bequest, legacy, devise, or gift is dependent upon the performance of some act, or the happening of some event, in order to become effective it is necessary that the performance of the act or the occurrence of the event shall have taken place before the deduction can be allowed. Where, by the terms of the bequest devise or gift, it is subject to be defeated by a subsequent act or event, no deduction will be allowed." 21 T. D. 785.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Provident Trust Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 291 U. S. 272. See also, &lt;i&gt;Hoagland&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kavanagh,&lt;/i&gt; 36 F. Supp. 875; &lt;i&gt;Ninth Bank &amp;amp; Trust Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 15 F. Supp. 951.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  Despite the conclusion of the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals to the contrary, the Government contends here that the proposed actuarial value of the conditional remainder to charity does not support the deduction. We do not reach that issue, but the facts material to are so follows: The Remarriage Table is based on a study of American experience conducted by a Committee of the Casualty Actuarial Society, 19 Proceedings of the Casualty Actuarial Society (1933), 279-349. The table is based solely upon the remarriage experience of windows who, through the deaths of their husbands, become beneficiaries under workmen's compensation laws in states where they lose compensation benefits upon remarriage. The reports relied upon cover experience for policy years 1921 to 1929, inclusive. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 286-288, 298. See also, Myers further Remarriage Experience 36 Proceedings of the Casualty Actuarial Society (1949), 73 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; The specially devised table as to the probability of issue is based upon statistics, for white women in 47 states and the District of Columbia, indicating the degree of probability that such women, after they are 27 years old, will marry and have first-born children. See the following Bureau of the Census publications for 1940; Vital Statistics of the United States, Pt. II, 89; Nativity and Parentage of the White Population&#151;General Characteristics 110; Types of Families 9. The instant computation assumes that such a child will survive its mother. 18 T. C. 836, 837-838.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  See note 3 of the Court's opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  See note 2 of the Court's opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  As the Court states the actuarial method and assumes by not reaching it, note 8 of the opinion, the correctness of the computation of the value of the conditional remainder to charity, we will merely add that this position accords with the conclusion of the Tax Court, 18 T. C. 836, and the Court of Appeals, 207 F. 2d 600, through its reliance on &lt;i&gt;Meierhof&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Higgins,&lt;/i&gt; 129 F. 2d 1002, 1003, a case also involving the multiple-decrement theory. See Jordan, Life Contingencies, 251.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  See &lt;i&gt;Meierhof&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Higgins,&lt;/i&gt; 129 F. 2d 1002, holding that the predecessors to &#167;&#167; 81.44 and 81.46 are to be read together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  &lt;i&gt;Humes&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 276 U. S. 487. It was there said:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Court of Claims did not find that the present value of the contingent bequests to the charities can be determined by the calculations of actuaries based upon experience tables. . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If all the facts stated had been embodied in findings, no legal basis would be laid for the deduction claimed. the volume and character of the experience upon which the conclusions drawn from these two tables are based, differ from the volume and character of the experience embodied in standard mortality tables, almost as widely as possibility from certainty." 276 U. S., at 492-493.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tables were based on the limited experience of male and female members of the Scotch peerage. &lt;i&gt;Merchants Bank&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 320 U.

Where, by the terms of the bequest, devise or gift, it is subject to be defeated by a subsequent act or event, no deduction will be allowed." Treas. Reg. 37, Art. 56.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued November 16, 1954.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided January 10, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF SOUTH CAROLINA.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;John R. Benney&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Holland, Ellis N. Slack, A. F. Prescott&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fred E. Youngman.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;J. D. Todd, Jr.&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE MINTON delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case involves the relative priority of a landlord's distress for rent under the laws of South Carolina and a lien for unpaid taxes due the United States. The landlord, herein referred to as respondent, on April 7, 1952, filed in the Court of Common Pleas for Greenville County, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*219&lt;/span&gt; South Carolina, an affidavit setting forth that Dan Tassey, Inc., was indebted to him for rent and requesting a distress warrant which issued. The master's report shows only that the landlord for past due rent "proceeded on the 7th day of April, 1952 to distress upon the assets of said corporation for said rent in arrears." The record does not disclose what was actually done in the distress proceedings. South Carolina Code Annotated, 1952, &#167; 41-151, provides when the affidavit of a landlord is filed the magistrate may issue his distress warrant naming the amount due with costs and deliver the warrant to an officer for service. The officer shall forthwith demand payment (&#167; 41-153), and if not paid, he shall distrain sufficient property on the rented premises to pay the amount, giving a list of property distrained together with a copy of the distress warrant to the tenant. The distress must be reasonable as to amount of property distrained, on penalty of action for damages (&#167;&#167; 41-158, 41-159). The tenant has five days in which to put up bond and free the property from the lien of distraint (&#167; 41-160).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, April 8, 1952, a receiver was appointed for the corporate taxpayer-tenant as an insolvent. All of the assets of the corporation passed to the receiver, who sold them and realized therefrom the fund over which this contest is waged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nonpayment of taxes due, the Collector of Internal Revenue received the proper assessment lists in his office on March 19, 1951, May 24, 1951, August 29, 1951, December 3, 1951, February 23, 1952, and February 28, 1952, and notice of these liens thereafter was filed in the proper office in Greenville County, South Carolina, on April 10, 1952. Section 3671 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that the lien for such unpaid taxes attaches when the assessment lists are received by the Collector. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*220&lt;/span&gt; Therefore, long before the landlord obtained a distress warrant the Government's liens for taxes had attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court of South Carolina held that, since the distress warrant was perfected before the receiver was appointed, the landlord's distress lien was superior to the United States' priority created by &#167; 3466, Revised Statutes, 31 U. S. C. &#167; 191. 224 S. C. 233, 78 S. E. 2d 277. We granted certiorari. 347 U. S. 974. However, we find it unnecessary to pass upon the effect of that section. We hold that the Government must prevail because of its liens under &#167; 3670, Internal Revenue Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landlord had a lien other than a mortgage, pledge, or judgment lien. As to all other liens, such as the distress lien in the instant case, &#167; 3672 of the Internal Revenue Code affords no protection. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Security Trust Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 340 U. S. 47, 51 (concurring opinion). Cf. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gilbert Associates, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 361, 362-365. Moreover, the distress lien was not perfected in the federal sense at the time the Government's liens were filed. Such perfection is, of course, a matter of federal law. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Waddill Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 323 U. S. 353; &lt;i&gt;Illinois&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Campbell,&lt;/i&gt; 329 U. S. 362, 371. The five-day period specified by &#167; 41-160 of the South Carolina Code had not elapsed. During this time the tenant-taxpayer could have reacquired any interest the landlord may have had in his property by posting bond as provided by the Code. Therefore, such a lien was only a caveat of a more perfect lien to come, as we have so often held in other cases. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Security Trust Co., supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gilbert Associates, Inc., supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Waddill Co., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 357-359; &lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maclay,&lt;/i&gt; 288 U. S. 290.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was decided in the trial court and argued here that the landlord was a purchaser within the meaning of &#167; 3672 of the Internal Revenue Code and, therefore, that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*221&lt;/span&gt; the Government lien was invalid as to him. A purchaser within the meaning of &#167; 3672 usually means one who acquires title for a valuable consideration in the manner of vendor and vendee. Obviously, the landlord was not a purchaser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Decided January 10, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Douglas D. Batchelor&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;David W. Dyer.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jacob Rassner&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main question presented in this case is whether an action under the Jones Act survives the death of the tortfeasor. In &lt;i&gt;Nordquist&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States Trust Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 188 F. 2d 776, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit answered this question in the affirmative. In the instant case the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit answered it in the negative, but allowed recovery on the basis of state law, 210 F. 2d 76. We granted certiorari in order to resolve this conflict. 347 U. S. 1009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*208&lt;/span&gt; Jim Dean was employed as a seaman on the M. V. &lt;i&gt;Wingate,&lt;/i&gt; owned and operated by Captain H. C. Farrington and Sid Cox, citizens of the United States and residents of Florida. The &lt;i&gt;Wingate&lt;/i&gt; sailed on or about December 22, 1949, from Matanzas, Cuba, and while on the high seas foundered and was lost. Captain Farrington's body was washed ashore on the Cuban coast, but no trace was found of Dean or the vessel. Sid Cox died in January 1951 of causes bearing no relation to the disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 1952, the respondent, as the administrator of the estate of Jim Dean, brought this action against the petitioners in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The complaint, brought under the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U. S. C. &#167; 688, alleged that Dean was a member of the crew of the &lt;i&gt;Wingate&lt;/i&gt; and had lost his life through the negligence of its owners. The petitioners Cox and Thompson are the administrators of the estate of Sid Cox, while Henrietta and Howard Farrington are the distributes of H. C. Farrington. The estates of Cox and Farrington had been probated and that of Farrington closed before this action was filed. Respondent filed no notice of claim in either estate proceeding within the 8-month period required by &#167; 733.16 of the Florida statutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary difficulty in this case stems from the fact that Congress, in passing the Jones Act, did not specifically enumerate the rights of seamen, but merely extended to them the same rights granted to railway employees by the Federal Employers' Liability Act. While the latter Act contained no clause specifically providing for the survival of actions against deceased tortfeasors, it did provide that the claim of the employee could be prosecuted against "the receiver or receivers or other persons or corporations charged with the duty of the management and operation of the business of a common carrier." 35 Stat. 66, 45 U. S. C. &#167; 57. Since railroads are rarely, if ever, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*209&lt;/span&gt; owned by individuals, and since they are subject to various regulations which prevent their discontinuing business, a clause permitting suit against the personal representative of the individual owner of a railroad was unnecessary. See 41 Stat. 477, 49 U. S. C. &#167; 1 (18). Congress fully provided for the corporate analogous of death when it provided that suit might continue against the receiver or successor corporation of the railroad. But where seamen covered by the Jones Act work aboard vessels owned by individuals, literal application of the words of the FELA would result in the denial of recovery against the personal representative of the tortfeasor. This, we feel, would frustrate the congressional purpose of "the benefit and protection of seamen who are peculiarly the wards of admiralty," &lt;i&gt;The Arizona&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Anelich,&lt;/i&gt; 298 U. S. 110, 123. The Jones Act, in providing that a seaman should have the same right of action as would a railroad employee, does not mean that the very words of the FELA must be lifted bodily from their context and applied mechanically to the specific facts of maritime events. Rather, it means that those contingencies against which Congress has provided to ensure recovery to railroad employees should also be met in the admiralty setting. Applying such a rule here, we conclude that Congress, having provided that railroad employees could recover regardless of the "survival" of the tortfeasor railroad, intended that the death of the tortfeasor should not defeat recovery under the Jones Act. As the Court said in &lt;i&gt;Markham&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cabell,&lt;/i&gt; 326 U. S. 404, 409, "The policy as well as the letter of the law is a guide to decision. Resort to the policy of a law may be had to ameliorate its seeming harshness or to qualify its apparent absolutes . . . . The process of interpretation also misses its high function if a strict reading of a law results in the emasculation or deletion of a provision which a less literal reading would preserve."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*210&lt;/span&gt; The extreme harshness of the old common-law rule abating actions on the death of the tortfeasor flies in the face of the expressed congressional purpose to provide for "the welfare of seamen." The Jones Act "As welfare legislation . . . is entitled to a liberal construction to accomplish its beneficent purposes." &lt;i&gt;Cosmopolitan Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McAllister,&lt;/i&gt; 337 U. S. 783, 790. Since the decision here is confined to an interpretation of the Jones Act, there is no need to consider the "slender basis" for the general admiralty rule against such survivorship of actions. See &lt;i&gt;Just&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chambers,&lt;/i&gt; 312 U. S. 383, 387, n. 4. Nevertheless, in considering the harshness of the rule sought to be imposed under the Jones Act, we do note that advancing civilization and social progress have brought 43 of our States to include in their general law the principle of the survival of causes of action against deceased tortfeasors, and that such recovery, rather than being exceptional, has now become the rule in almost every common-law jurisdiction. See the discussion by Roscoe Pound on death statutes as part of the general law, 13 NACCA L. J. 188-189 (May 1954).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners make the further claim that even if the Jones Act is interpreted to allow an action to proceed against the personal representatives of the tortfeasors, this suit must fail because respondent did not comply with the Florida statute governing the distribution of decedents' estates. The short answer to this is that Congress, within its constitutional power, decreed a 3-year statute of limitations uniformly throughout the Nation, &lt;i&gt;Panama R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Johnson,&lt;/i&gt; 264 U. S. 375, 392, and no state statute can diminish this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;No. 37.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued October 20-21, 1954.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided December 6, 1954.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*123&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sumner M. Redstone&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Peyton Ford&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioners. With them on the brief were &lt;i&gt;H. D. Reed&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Frank A. Bruno.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Marvin E. Frankel&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Holland, Ellis N. Slack&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Joseph F. Goetten.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*124&lt;/span&gt; MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners, husband and wife, stand convicted under &#167; 145 of the Internal Revenue Code&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; of an attempt to evade and defeat their income taxes for the year 1948. The prosecution was based on the net worth method of proof, also in issue in three companion cases.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; and a number of other decisions here from the Courts of Appeals of nine circuits. During the past two decades this Court has been asked to review an increasing number of criminal cases in which proof of tax evasion rested on this theory. We have denied certiorari because the cases involved only questions of evidence and, in isolation, presented no important questions of law. In 1943 the Court did have occasion to pass upon an application of the net worth theory where the taxpayer had no records. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Johnson,&lt;/i&gt; 319 U. S. 503.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, however, tax-evasion convictions obtained under the net worth theory have come here with increasing frequency and left impressions beyond those of the previously unrelated petitions. We concluded that the method involved something more than the ordinary use of circumstantial evidence in the usual criminal case. Its bearing, therefore, on the safeguards traditionally &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*125&lt;/span&gt; provided in the administration of criminal justice called for a consideration of the entire theory. At our last Term a number of cases arising from the Courts of Appeals brought to our attention the serious doubts of those courts regarding the implications of the net worth method. Accordingly, we granted certiorari in these four cases and have held others to await their decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a typical net worth prosecution, the Government having concluded that the taxpayer's records are inadequate as a basis for determining income tax liability, attempts to establish an "opening net worth" or total net value of the taxpayer's assets at the beginning of a given year. It then proves increases in the taxpayer's net worth for each succeeding year during the period under examination and calculates the difference between the adjusted net values of the taxpayer's assets at the beginning and end of each of the years involved. The taxpayer's nondeductible expenditures, including living expenses, are added to these increases, and if the resulting figure for any year is substantially greater than the taxable income reported by the taxpayer for that year, the Government claims the excess represents unreported taxable income. In addition, it asks the jury to infer willfulness from this understatement, when taken in connection with direct evidence of "conduct, the likely effect of which would be to mislead or to conceal." &lt;i&gt;Spies&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 317 U. S. 492, 499.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before proceeding with a discussion of these cases, we believe it important to outline the general problems implicit in this type of litigation. In this consideration we assume, as we must in view of its widespread use, that the Government deems the net worth method useful in the enforcement of the criminal sanctions of our income tax laws. Nevertheless, careful study indicates that it is so fraught with danger for the innocent that the courts must closely scrutinize its use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*126&lt;/span&gt; One basic assumption in establishing guilt by this method is that most assets derive from a taxable source, and that when this is not true the taxpayer is in a position to explain the discrepancy. The application of such an assumption raises serious legal problems in the administration of the criminal law. Unlike civil actions for the recovery of deficiencies, where the determinations of the Commissioner have &lt;i&gt;prima facie&lt;/i&gt; validity, the prosecution must always prove the criminal charge beyond a reasonable doubt. This has led many of our courts to be disturbed by the use of the net worth method, particularly in its scope and the latitude which it allows prosecutors. &lt;i&gt;E. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Demetree&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 207 F. 2d 892, 894 (1953); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Caserta,&lt;/i&gt; 199 F. 2d 905, 907 (1952); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fenwick,&lt;/i&gt; 177 F. 2d 488.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the net worth method has not grown up overnight. It was first utilized in such cases as &lt;i&gt;Capone&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 51 F. 2d 609 (1931) and &lt;i&gt;Guzik&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 54 F. 2d 618 (1931), to corroborate direct proof of specific unreported income. In &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Johnson, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; this Court approved of its use to support the inference that the taxpayer, owner of a vast and elaborately concealed network of gambling houses upon which he declared no income, had indeed received unreported income in a "substantial amount." It was a potent weapon in establishing taxable income from undisclosed sources when all other efforts failed. Since the &lt;i&gt;Johnson&lt;/i&gt; case, however, its horizons have been widened until now it is used in run-of-the-mine cases, regardless of the amount of tax deficiency involved. In each of the four cases decided today the allegedly unreported income comes from the same disclosed sources as produced the taxpayer's reported income and in none is the tax deficiency anything like the deficiencies in &lt;i&gt;Johnson, Capone&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Guzik.&lt;/i&gt; The net worth method, it seems, has evolved from the final volley to the first shot in the Government's &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*127&lt;/span&gt; battle for revenue, and its use in the ordinary income-bracket cases greatly increases the chances for error. This leads us to point out the dangers that must be consciously kept in mind in order to assure adequate appraisal of the specific facts in individual cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Among the defenses often asserted is the taxpayer's claim that the net worth increase shown by the Government's statement is in reality not an increase at all because of the existence of substantial cash on hand at the starting point. This favorite defense asserts that the cache is made up of many year's savings which for various reasons were hidden and not expended until the prosecution period. Obviously, the Government has great difficulty in refuting such a contention. However, taxpayers too encounter many obstacles in convincing the jury of the existence of such hoards. This is particularly so when the emergence of the hidden savings also uncovers a fraud on the taxpayer's creditors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this connection, the taxpayer frequently gives "leads" to the Government agents indicating the specific sources from which his cash on hand has come, such as prior earnings, stock transactions, real estate profits inheritances, gifts, etc. Sometimes these "leads" point back to old transactions far removed from the prosecution period. Were the Government required to run down all such leads it would face grave investigative difficulties; still its failure to do so might jeopardize the position of the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. As we have said, the method requires assumptions, among which is the equation of unexplained increases in net worth with unreported taxable income. Obviously such an assumption has many weaknesses. It may be that gifts, inheritances, loans and the like account for the newly acquired wealth. There is great danger that the jury may assume that once the Government has established the figures in its worth computations, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*128&lt;/span&gt; the crime of tax evasion automatically follows. The possibility of this increases where the jury, without guarding instructions, is allowed to take into the jury room the various charts summarizing the computations; bare figures have a way of acquiring an existence of their own, independent of the evidence which gave rise to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Although it may sound fair to say that the taxpayer can explain the "bulge" in his net worth, he may be entirely honest and yet unable to recount his financial history. In addition, such a rule would tend to shift the burden of proof. Were the taxpayer compelled to come forward with evidence, he might risk lending support to the Government's case by showing loose business methods or losing the jury through his apparent evasiveness. Of course, in other criminal prosecutions juries may disbelieve and convict the innocent. But the courts must minimize this danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. When there are no books and records, willfulness may be inferred by the jury from that fact coupled with proof of an understatement of income. But when the Government uses the net worth method, and the books and records of the taxpayer appear correct on their face, an inference of willfulness from net worth increases alone might be unjustified, especially where the circumstances surrounding the deficiency are as consistent with innocent mistake as with willful violation. On the other hand, the very failure of the books to disclose a proved deficiency might indicate deliberate falsification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. In many cases of this type, the prosecution relies on the taxpayer's statements, made to revenue agents in the course of their investigation, to establish vital links in the Government's proof. But when a revenue agent confronts the taxpayer with an apparent deficiency, the latter may be more concerned with a quick settlement than an honest search for the truth. Moreover, the prosecution may pick and choose from the taxpayer's statement, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*129&lt;/span&gt; relying on the favorable portion and throwing aside that which does not bolster its position. The problem of corroboration, dealt with in the companion cases of &lt;i&gt;Smith&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 147, and &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Calderon, post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 160, therefore becomes crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. The statute defines the offense here involved by individual years. While the Government may be able to prove with reasonable accuracy an increase in net worth over a period of years, it often has great difficulty in relating that income sufficiently to any specific prosecution year. While a steadily increasing net worth may justify an inference of additional earnings, unless that increase can be reasonably allocated to the appropriate tax year the taxpayer may be convicted on counts of which he is innocent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we cannot say that these pitfalls inherent in the net worth method foreclose its use, they do require the exercise of great care and restraint. The complexity of the problem is such that it cannot be met merely by the application of general rules. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Universal Camera Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Labor Board,&lt;/i&gt; 340 U. S. 474, 489. Trial courts should approach these cases in the full realization that the taxpayer may be ensnared in a system which, though difficult for the prosecution to utilize, is equally hard for the defendant to refute. Charges should be especially clear, including, in addition to the formal instructions, a summary of the nature of the net worth method, the assumptions on which it rests, and the inferences available both for and against the accused. Appellate courts should review the cases, bearing constantly in mind the difficulties that arise when circumstantial evidence as to guilt is the chief weapon of a method that is itself only an approximation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these considerations as a guide, we turn to the facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*130&lt;/span&gt; The indictment returned against the Hollands embraced three counts. The first two charged Marion L. Holland, the husband, with attempted evasion of his income tax for the years 1946 and 1947. He was found not guilty by the jury on both of these counts. The third count charged Holland and his wife with attempted evasion in 1948 of the tax on $19,736.74 not reported by them in their joint return. The jury found both of them guilty. Mrs. Holland was fined $5,000, while her husband was sentenced to two years' imprisonment and fined $10,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government's opening net worth computation shows defendants with a net worth of $19,152.59 at the beginning of the indictment period. Shortly thereafter, defendants purchased a hotel, bar and restaurant, and began operating them as the Holland House. Within three years, during which they reported $31,265.92 in taxable income, their apparent net worth increased by $113,185.32.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; The Government's evidence indicated that, during 1948, the year for which defendants were convicted, their net worth increased by some $32,000, while the amount of taxable income reported by them totaled less than one-third that sum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;Use of Net Worth Method Where Books Are Apparently Adequate.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have previously noted, this is not the first net worth case to reach this Court. In &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Johnson, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; the Court affirmed a tax-evasion conviction on evidence showing that the taxpayer's expenditures had exceeded his "available declared resources." Since Johnson and his concealed establishments had destroyed &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*131&lt;/span&gt; the few records they had, the Government was forced to resort to the net worth method of proof. This Court approved on the ground that "to require more . . . would be tantamount to holding that skilful concealment is an invincible barrier to proof," 319 U. S., at 517-518. Petitioners ask that we restrict the &lt;i&gt;Johnson&lt;/i&gt; case to situations where the taxpayer has kept no books. They claim that &#167; 41 of the Internal Revenue Code,&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; expressly limiting the authority of the Government to deviate from the taxpayer's method of accounting, confines the net worth method to situations where the taxpayer has no books or where his books are inadequate. Despite some support for this view among the lower courts (see &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Riganto,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/vaed/9kQK/united-states-v-riganto/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;121&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;158&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 161, 162; &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Williams,&lt;/i&gt; 208 F. 2d 437, 437-438; &lt;i&gt;Remmer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 205 F. 2d 277, 286, judgment vacated on other grounds, 347 U. S. 227), we conclude that this argument must fail. The provision that the "net income shall be computed . . . in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the books of such taxpayer," refers to methods such as the cash receipts or the accrual method, which allocate income and expenses between years. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Can Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 280 U. S. 412, 419. The net worth technique as used in this case, is not a method of accounting different from the one employed by defendants. It is not a method of accounting at all, except insofar as it calls upon taxpayers to account for their unexplained income. Petitioners' accounting system was appropriate &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*132&lt;/span&gt; for their business purposes; and, admittedly, the Government did not detect any specific false entries therein. Nevertheless, if we believe the Government's evidence, as the jury did, we must conclude that the defendants' books were more consistent than truthful, and that many items of income had disappeared before they had even reached the recording stage. Certainly Congress never intended to make &#167; 41 a set of blinders which prevents the Government from looking beyond the self-serving declarations in a taxpayer's books. "The United States has relied for the collection of its income tax largely upon the taxpayer's own disclosures . . . . This system can function successfully only if those within and near taxable income keep and render true accounts." &lt;i&gt;Spies&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 317 U. S., at 495. To protect the revenue from those who do not "render true accounts," the Government must be free to use all legal evidence available to it in determining whether the story told by the taxpayer's books accurately reflects his financial history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;Establishing a Definite Opening Net Worth.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We agree with petitioners that an essential condition in cases of this type is the establishment, with reasonable certainty, of an opening net worth, to serve as a starting point from which to calculate future increases in the taxpayer's assets. The importance of accuracy in this figure is immediately apparent, as the correctness of the result depends entirely upon the inclusion in this sum of all assets on hand at the outset. The Government's net worth statement included as assets at the starting point stock costing $29,650 and $2,153.09 in cash.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; The Hollands claim that the Government failed to include in its opening net worth figure an accumulation of $113,000 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*133&lt;/span&gt; in currency and "hundreds and possibly thousands of shares of stock" which they owned at the beginning of the prosecution period. They asserted that the cash had been accumulated prior to the opening date, $104,000 of it before 1933, and the balance between 1933 and 1945. They had kept the money, they claimed, mostly in $100 bills and at various times in a canvas bag, a suitcase, and a metal box. They had never dipped into it until 1946, when it became the source of the apparent increase in wealth which the Government later found in the form of a home, a ranch, a hotel and other properties. This was the main issue presented to the jury. The Government did not introduce any direct evidence to dispute this claim. Rather it relied on the inference that anyone who had had $104,000 in cash would not have undergone the hardship and privation endured by the Hollands all during the late 20's and throughout the 30's. During this period they lost their cafe business; accumulated $35,000 in debts which were never paid; lost their household furniture because of an unpaid balance of $92.20; suffered a default judgment for $506.66; and were forced to separate for some eight years because it was to their "economical advantage." During the latter part of this period, Mrs. Holland was obliged to support herself and their son by working at a motion picture house in Denver while her husband was in Wyoming. The evidence further indicated that improvements to the hotel, and other assets acquired during the prosecution years, were bought in installments and with bills of small denominations, as if out of earnings rather than from an accumulation of $100 bills. The Government also negatived the possibility of petitioners' accumulating such a sum by checking Mr. Holland's income tax returns as far back as 1913, showing that the income declared in previous years was insufficient to enable defendants to save any appreciable &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*134&lt;/span&gt; amount of money. The jury resolved this question of the existence of a cache of cash against the Hollands, and we believe the verdict was fully supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to the stock, Mr. Holland began dabbling in the stock market in a small way in 1937 and 1938. His purchases appear to have been negligible and on borrowed money. His only reported income from stocks was in his tax returns for 1944 and 1945 when he disclosed dividends of $1,600 and $1,850 respectively. While the record is unclear on this point, it appears that during the period from 1942 to 1945 he pledged considerable stock as collateral for loans. There is no evidence, however, showing what portions of this stock Mr. Holland actually owned at any one time, since he was trading in shares from day to day. And, even if we assume that he owned all the stock, some 4,550 shares, there is evidence that Mr. Holland's stock transactions were usually in "stock selling for only a few dollars per share." In this light, the Government's figure of approximately $30,000 is not out of line. In 1946 Holland reported the sale of about $50,000 in stock, but no receipt of dividends; nor were dividends reported in subsequent years. It is reasonable to assume that he sold all of his stock in 1946. In fact, Holland stated to the revenue agents that he had not "fooled with the stock market" since the beginning of 1946; that he had not owned any stocks for two or three years prior to 1949; that he had saved about $50,000 from 1933 to 1946, and that in 1946 he had $9,000 in cash with the balance of his savings in stocks.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; The Government's evidence, bolstered by the admissions of petitioners, provided &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*135&lt;/span&gt; convincing proof that they had no stock other than the amount included in the opening net worth statement. By the same token, the petitioners' argument that the Government failed to account for the proceeds of stock sold by them before the starting date must also fail. The Government's evidence fully justified the jury's conclusion that there were no proceeds over and above the amount credited to petitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Government's Investigation of Leads.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So overwhelming, indeed, was the Government's proof on the issue of cash on hand that the Government agents did not bother to check petitioners' story that some of the cash represented proceeds from the sales of two cafes in the 20's; and that in 1933 an additional portion of this $113,000 in currency was obtained by exchanging some $12,000 in gold at a named bank. While sound administration of the criminal law requires that the net worth approach&#151;a powerful method of proving otherwise undetectable offenses&#151;should not be denied the Government, its failure to investigate leads furnished by the taxpayer might result in serious injustice. It is, of course, not for us to prescribe investigative procedures,&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; but it is within the province of the courts to pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence to convict. When the Government rests its case solely on the approximations and circumstantial inferences of a net worth computation, the cogency of its proof depends upon its effective negation of reasonable explanations by the taxpayer inconsistent with guilt. Such refutation might fail when the Government does not track down relevant leads furnished by the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*136&lt;/span&gt; taxpayer&#151;leads reasonably susceptible of being checked, which, if true, would establish the taxpayer's innocence. When the Government fails to show an investigation into the validity of such leads, the trial judge may consider them as true and the Government's case insufficient to go to the jury. This should aid in forestalling unjust prosecutions, and have the practical advantage of eliminating the dilemma, especially serious in this type of case, of the accused's being forced by the risk of an adverse verdict to come forward to substantiate leads which he had previously furnished the Government. It is a procedure entirely consistent with the position long espoused by the Government, that its duty is not to convict but to see that justice is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the Government's detailed investigation was a complete answer to the petitioners' explanations. Admitting that in cases of this kind it "would be desirable to track to its conclusion every conceivable line of inquiry," the Government centered its inquiry on the explanations of the Hollands and entered upon a detailed investigation of their lives covering several states and over a score of years. The jury could have believed that Mr. Holland had received moneys from the sale of cafes in the twenties and that he had turned in gold in 1933 and still it could reasonably have concluded that the Hollands lacked the claimed cache of currency in 1946, the crucial year. Even if these leads were assumed to be true, the Government's evidence was sufficient to convict. The distant incidents relied on by petitioners were so remote in time and in their connection with subsequent events proved by the Government that, whatever petitioners' net worth in 1933, it appears by convincing evidence that on January 1, 1946, they had only such assets as the Government credited to them in its opening net worth statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*137&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Net Worth Increases Must be Attributable to Taxable Income.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also requisite to the use of the net worth method is evidence supporting the inference that the defendant's net worth increases are attributable to currently taxable income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government introduced evidence tending to show that although the business of the hotel apparently increased during the years in question, the reported profits fell to approximately one-quarter of the amount declared by the previous management in a comparable period;&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; that the cash register tapes, on which the books were based, were destroyed by the petitioners; and that the books did not reflect the receipt of money later withdrawn from the hotel's cash register for the personal living expenses of the petitioners and for payments made for restaurant supplies. The unrecorded items in this latter category totaled over $12,500 for 1948. Thus there was ample evidence that not all the income from the hotel had been included in its books and records. In fact, the net worth increase claimed by the Government for 1948 could have come entirely from the unreported income of the hotel and still the hotel's total earnings for the year would have been only 73% of the sum reported by the previous owner for the comparable period in 1945.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But petitioners claim the Government failed to adduce adequate proof because it did not negative all the possible nontaxable sources of the alleged net worth increases&#151;gifts, loans, inheritances, etc. We cannot agree. The Government's proof, in our view, carried with it the negations the petitioners urge. Increases in net &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*138&lt;/span&gt; worth, standing alone, cannot be assumed to be attributable to currently taxable income. But proof of a likely source, from which the jury could reasonably find that the net worth increases sprang, is sufficient. In the &lt;i&gt;Johnson&lt;/i&gt; case, where there was no direct evidence of the source of the taxpayer's income, this Court's conclusion that the taxpayer "had large, unreported income was reinforced by proof . . . that [for certain years his] private expenditures . . . exceeded his available declared resources." This was sufficient to support "the finding that he had some unreported income which was properly attributable to his earnings . . . ." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Johnson,&lt;/i&gt; 319 U. S., at 517. There the taxpayer was the owner of an undisclosed business capable of producing taxable income; here the disclosed business of the petitioners was proven to be capable of producing much more income than was reported and in a quantity sufficient to account for the net worth increases. Any other rule would burden the Government with investigating the many possible nontaxable sources of income, each of which is as unlikely as it is difficult to disprove. This is not to say that the Government may disregard explanations of the defendant reasonably susceptible of being checked. But where relevant leads are not forthcoming, the Government is not required to negate every possible source of nontaxable income, a matter peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant. See &lt;i&gt;Rossi&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 289 U. S. 89, 91-92.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Burden of Proof Remains on the Government.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor does this rule shift the burden of proof. The Government must still prove every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt though not to a mathematical certainty. The settled standards of the criminal law are applicable to net worth cases just as to prosecutions for other crimes. Once the Government has established its &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*139&lt;/span&gt; case, the defendant remains quiet at his peril. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Yee Hem&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 268 U. S. 178, 185. The practical disadvantages to the taxpayer are lessened by the pressures on the Government to check and negate relevant leads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;Willfulness Must be Present.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final element necessary for conviction is willfulness. The petitioners contend that willfulness "involves a specific intent which must be proven by independent evidence and which cannot be inferred from the mere understatement of income." This is a fair statement of the rule. Here, however, there was evidence of a consistent pattern of underreporting large amounts of income, and of the failure on petitioners' part to include all of their income in their books and records. Since, on proper submission, the jury could have found that these acts supported an inference of willfulness, their verdict must stand. &lt;i&gt;Spies&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 499-500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Charge to the Jury.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners press upon us, finally, the contention that the instructions of the trial court were so erroneous and misleading as to constitute grounds for reversal. We have carefully reviewed the instructions and cannot agree. But some require comment. The petitioners assail the refusal of the trial judge to instruct that where the Government's evidence is circumstantial it must be such as to exclude every reasonable hypothesis other than that of guilt. There is some support for this type of instruction in the lower court decisions, &lt;i&gt;Garst&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;180&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;339&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 343; &lt;i&gt;Anderson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 30 F. 2d 485-487; &lt;i&gt;Stutz&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 47 F. 2d 1029, 1030; &lt;i&gt;Hanson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 208 F. 2d 914, 916, but the better rule is that where the jury is properly instructed on the standards for reasonable doubt, such an additional instruction &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*140&lt;/span&gt; on circumstantial evidence is confusing and incorrect, &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Austin-Bagley Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 31 F. 2d 229, 234, cert. denied, 279 U. S. 863; &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Becker,&lt;/i&gt; 62 F. 2d 1007, 1010; 1 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.), &#167;&#167; 25-26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circumstantial evidence in this respect is intrinsically no different from testimonial evidence. Admittedly, circumstantial evidence may in some cases point to a wholly incorrect result. Yet this is equally true of testimonial evidence. In both instances, a jury is asked to weigh the chances that the evidence correctly points to guilt against the possibility of inaccuracy or ambiguous inference. In both, the jury must use its experience with people and events in weighing the probabilities. If the jury is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, we can require no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more insistent is the petitioners' attack, not made below, on the charge of the trial judge as to reasonable doubt. He defined it as "the kind of doubt . . . which you folks in the more serious and important affairs of your own lives might be willing to act upon." We think this section of the charge should have been in terms of the kind of doubt that would make a person hesitate to act, see &lt;i&gt;Bishop&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 71 App. D. C. 132, 137-138, 107 F. 2d 297, 303, rather than the kind on which he would be willing to act. But we believe that the instruction as given was not of the type that could mislead the jury into finding no reasonable doubt when in fact there was some. A definition of a doubt as something the jury would act upon would seem to create confusion rather than misapprehension. "Attempts to explain the term `reasonable doubt' do not usually result in making it any clearer to the minds of the jury," &lt;i&gt;Miles&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 103 U. S. 304, 312, and we feel that, taken as a whole, the instructions correctly conveyed the concept of reasonable doubt to the jury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*141&lt;/span&gt; Petitioners also assign as error the refusal of the trial judge to give instructions on the wording of the criminal statute under which they were indicted, even though the judge fully and correctly instructed the jury on every element of the crime. The impossibility of pointing to any way in which defendants' rights were prejudiced by this, assuming it was error, is enough to indicate that the trial judge was correct, see &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Center Veal &amp;amp; Beef Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 162 F. 2d 766, 771. There is here no question of the jury's duty to apply the law to the facts. That operation implies the application of a general standard to the specific physical facts as found by the jury. The meanings of standards such as willfulness were properly explained by the trial judge in no greater particularity than necessary, and thus the jury's function was not invaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the light of these considerations the judgment is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This is a civil antitrust action brought by the Government in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Named as defendants are Lee Shubert,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; Jacob J. Shubert, Marcus Heiman, and three corporations controlled by them.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; The defendants are principally engaged in the business of producing legitimate theatrical attractions,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; booking legitimate attractions in theatres throughout the United States,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and operating approximately 40 theatres in eight states for the presentation of legitimate attractions.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="fn5_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; The Government's complaint charges that the defendants, in the course of this business, have violated &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6" id="fn6_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; On the defendants' motion, after this Court's decision in Toolson v.

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p2"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Government's complaint, which is summarized in an appendix to this opinion, describes the interstate phases of the defendants' theatrical business in considerable detail. It concludes that the business of producing, booking, and presenting legitimate attractions requires&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p3"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'a constant, continuous stream of trade and commerce between      the States of the United States, consisting of the assemblage      of personnel and property for rehearsals, the transportation      of said personnel and property to various cities throughout      the United States, the making and performing of contracts      under which attractions are routed and presented in various      States of the United States, and the transmission of      applications, letters, memoranda, communications,      commitments, contracts, money, checks, drafts and other media      of exchange across State lines.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p4"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The complaint alleges that the defendants have restrained this trade and commerce, and have monopolized certain phases of it, through a conspiracy (a) to compel other producers to book their legitimate attractions exclusively through the defendants, (b) to exclude others from booking legitimate attractions, (c) to prevent competition in the presentation of legitimate attractions, (d) to discriminate in favor of their own productions with respect to booking and presentation, and (e) to combine their power in booking and presentation in order to maintain and strengthen their domination in each of these fields. The main relief sought by the Government is the divorcement of the booking and presentation branches of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p5"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The allegations of the complaint, on a motion to dismiss, must of course be taken as true. And the defendants do not deny that the allegations state a cause of action if their business is subject to the Sherman Act. The question presented is thus a narrow one: whether the business of producing, booking, and presenting legitimate attractions on a multistate basis constitutes 'trade or commerce' that is 'among the several States' within the meaning of those terms in the Sherman Act.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

A similarly liberal construction has been given the requirement of &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 1 and 2 that the 'trade or commerce' be 'among the several States.' Thus, in the South-Eastern Underwriters case (&lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wVg/united-states-v-south-eastern-underwriters-assn/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;322&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;533&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 64 S.Ct. 1167), the requirement was satisfied by a 'continuous and indivisible stream of intercourse among the states' involving the transmission of large sums of money and communications by mail, telephone, and telegraph. Cf. Electric Bond &amp;amp; Share Co. v. Securities and Exchange Commission, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wBG/electric-bond-co-v-commn/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;303&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;419&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 432&amp;#8212;433, 58 S.Ct. 678, 681&amp;#8212;682, 82 L.Ed. 936; North American Co. v.

In the Associated Press case, the requirement was satisfied by the interstate dissemination of news. See also Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xcj/lorain-journal-co-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;342&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;143&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 72 S.Ct. 181, 96 L.Ed. 162. And in the motion picture cases, the requirement was satisfied by the interstate transportation of films, Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, supra, even though the actual 'showing of motion pictures is of course a local affair.' United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., supra, 323 U.S. at page 183, 65 S.Ct. at page 259, 89 L.Ed. 160. See also Hart v. B. F. Keith Vaudeville Exchange, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/vMU/hart-v-bf-keith-vaudeville-exchange/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;262&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;271&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn8" id="fn8_ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; 43 S.Ct. 540, 67 L.Ed. 977.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p7"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;These decisions, apart from Federal Base Ball and Toolson, make it clear beyond question that the allegations of the Government's complaint bring the defendants within the scope of the Sherman Act, even though the actual performance of a legitimate stage attraction 'is of course a local affair.' The defendants contend, however, that Federal Base Ball and Toolson have already established their immunity under the Act. While conceding, as they must, that the motion picture industry is subject to the antitrust laws, they insist that all other businesses built around the performance of local exhibitions are exempt.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn9" id="fn9_ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt; We believe that Federal Base Ball and Toolson afford no basis for such a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p8"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In Federal Base Ball, the Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Holmes, was dealing with the business of baseball and nothing else. The Court considered the nature of the game, its history and league organization, the necessity of arranging games between cities in different states, and the resulting travel across state lines. The travel, the Court concluded, was 'a mere incident, not the essential thing.' On that basis, the Court held that 'the restrictions by contract that prevented the plaintiff from getting players to break their bargains and the other conduct charged against the defendants were not an interference with commerce among the States.' (259 U.S. 209, 42 S.Ct. 466.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p9"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;At the very next Term, in Hart v. B. F. Keith Vaudeville Exchange, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/vMU/hart-v-bf-keith-vaudeville-exchange/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;262&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;271&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 43 S.Ct. 540, 67 L.Ed. 977, the Court was directly concerned with the effect of the Federal Base Ball decision on the status of the theatrical business under the Sherman Act. The complaint in the Hart case, much like the complaint here under review, alleged a conspiracy to control the booking and presentation of vaudeville acts in theatres throughout the country. The district court, like the district court in the instant case, dismissed the complaint on the authority of Federal Base Ball. This Court, again speaking through Mr. Justice Holmes, unanimously reversed.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn10" id="fn10_ref"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; The Court took note of the plaintiff's argument (263 U.S. 271, 43 S.Ct. 541) 'that in the transportation of vaudeville acts the apparatus sometimes is more important than the performers' and concluded that the complaint, at least to that extent, sufficiently alleged a violation of the Act to permit the case to go to trial. The Court distinguished Federal Base Ball on the ground that 'what in general is incidental, in some instances may rise to a magnitude that requires it to be considered independently.' The Court thus established, contrary to the defendants' argument here, that Federal Base Ball did not automatically immunize the theatrical business from the antitrust laws.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p10"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In Toolson, where the issue was the same as in Federal Base Ball, the Court was confronted with a unique combination of circumstances. For over 30 years there had stood a decision of this Court specifically fixing the status of the baseball business under the antitrust laws and more particularly the validity of the so-called 'reserve clause.' During this period, in reliance on the Federal Base Ball precedent, the baseball business had grown and developed. Compare Helvering v. Hallock, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wGU/helvering-v-hallock/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;309&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;106&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 110, 60 S.Ct. 444, 446, 84 L.Ed. 604. And Congress, although it had actively considered the ruling, had not seen fit to reject it by amendatory legislation. Against this background, the Court in Toolson was asked to overrule Federal Base Ball on the ground that it was out of step with subsequent decisions reflecting presentday concepts of interstate commerce. The Court, in view of the circumstances of the case, declined to do so. But neither did the Court necessarily reaffirm all that was said in Federal Base Ball. Instead, '(w)ithout re-examination of the underlying issues,' the Court adhered to Federal Base Ball 'so far as that decision determines that Congress had no intention of including the business of baseball within the scope of the federal antitrust laws.' (&lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xga/toolson-v-new-york-yankees-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;346&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;356&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 74 S.Ct. 79) In short, Toolson was a narrow application of the rule of stare decisis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p11"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The defendants would have us convert this narrow application of the rule into a sweeping grant of immunity to every business based on the live presentation of local exhibitions, regardless of how extensive its interstate phases may be. We cannot do so. If the Toolson holding is to be expanded&amp;#8212;or contracted&amp;#8212;the appropriate remedy lies with Congress. See United States v. South Eastern Underwriters Association, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wVg/united-states-v-south-eastern-underwriters-assn/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;322&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;533&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 561, 64 S.Ct. 1162, 1178, 88 L.Ed. 1440. Moreover, none of the considerations which led to the decision in Toolson are present here. This Court has never held that the theatrical business is not subject to the Sherman Act. On the contrary, less than a year after the Federal Base Ball decision, the Court in the Hart case put the theatrical business on notice that Federal Base Ball could not be relied upon as a basis for exemption from the antitrust laws. The rule of stare decisis undoubtedly embodies a policy of basic importance, but the rule cannot help the defendants here. If it is to be applied, Hart and the motion picture cases&amp;#8212;not Federal Base Ball and Toolson&amp;#8212;are the controlling decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p12"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;We are not yet called upon to determine whether the defendants have in fact violated the Sherman Act or if they have what relief would be appropriate. We hold only that the allegations of the complaint state a cause of action and that the Government is entitled to an opportunity to prove those allegations. The judgment of the court below is reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p13"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p14"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Justice BURTON, retaining the views expressed in his dissent in the Toolson case, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xga/toolson-v-new-york-yankees-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;346&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;356&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 357, 74 S.Ct. 78, 98 L.Ed. 64, joins the opinion and judgment of the Court in this case. Mr. Justice REED joins in this concurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p15"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Justice MINTON agrees with the judgment in this case because, as it comes here on the pleadings, it is controlled by the Hart case. Whether the Government can prove its case now to the satisfaction of present courts, which the plaintiff could not do in the Hart case, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca2/8D1f/hart-v-bf-keith-vaudeville-exchange/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;341&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class="center"&gt;APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p16"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The defendants state at page 3 of their brief: 'The allegations of the compaint are summarized adequately at pages 5 to 11 of the Government's brief.' That portion of the Government's brief is set out below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p17"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Production of a legitimate theatrical attraction involves (1) assembling of its component elements, including a script, financial backing, actors, stage hands, designers, advertising agents, scenery, costumes, lighting, and music; (2) rehearsals to weld the parts into an attraction suitable for presentation; (3) arranging for the booking and presentation of the attraction in a try-out town or towns, in New York City, and in road-show towns; and (4) transporting the entire cast and scenery to try-out towns, to New York City, and to road-show towns throughout the United States to fulfill these bookings and presentation arrangements (par. 24, R. 4). At the present time the cost of producing a play runs from $60,000 to $100,000, and of a musical from $200,000 to $300,000 (par. 25, R. 4). Persons other than the producer usually supply the necessary financing (ibid.). Frequently the production is incorporated and shares of stock are sold to investors, or the producer organizes a limited partnership (ibid.). All the appellees invest in legitimate attractions (pars. 3&amp;#8212;7, R. 1&amp;#8212;3).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p18"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;After the production has been assembled and rehearsals have been completed, the attraction is presented in one or more 'try-out' towns for the purpose of judging audience reaction and correcting observed deficiencies (pars. 20, 26, R. 4, 5). Audience reaction in try-out towns is important in gauging subsequent financial success in New York City and on the road (par. 26, R. 5). The attraction is then presented in New York City (par. 27, R. 5). If the run there is successful, the attraction is sent on tour to 'roadshow' towns throughout the United States (ibid.). This road-show tour is an 'integral part of the exploitation of the attraction' and is the source of a 'substantial part' of its profits (ibid.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p19"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;With the exception of a few cities, a legitimate attraction ordinarily cannot profitably play in a road-show town for more than a limited period of time, seldom exceeding two weeks. The producer of a play must therefore obtain playing dates in a number of suitable road-show towns, arranged so as to minimize lay-offs and travel between engagements. Successful operation of a theatre in a road-show town requires scheduling legitimate attractions so as to keep the theatre as continuously occupied as possible during the theatrical season. Playing dates of a road-show town must therefore be arranged so as to meet the needs of both the producer and the theatre operator. (Par. 29, R. 5.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p20"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;UBO acts as middleman between producers and operators of theatres in tryout and road-show towns, but is regarded as the agent of the theatre operators and usually receives, as compensation for its services, five per cent of the operator's share of the theatre's gross receipts (par. 28, R. 5). Each year UBO enters into or renews agreements with theatre operators to act as their booking agent (par. 30, R. 5). After negotiation with the producer of an attraction, UBO tentatively schedules it at various theatres throughout the United States, and contracts covering presentation at these theatres are subsequently executed (id., R. 5&amp;#8212;6). The booking of legitimate attractions involves the cross-country routing of attractions in a constant stream to and from theatres in various cities throughout the United States (par. 28, R. 5).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p21"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The individual appellees control the booking of legitimate attractions in tryout and road-show towns in the United States (par. 37, R. 7). Apart from Select and a subsidiary thereof, UBO is the only concern in the country which books legitimate attractions throughout the United States (par. 5, R. 2). From 1932 to 1946, UBO followed a policy of entering into franchise agreements with theatre operators making UBO the exclusive booking agent for their theatres (par. 40, R. 8&amp;#8212;9). About 1946, UBO discontinued formal franchise agreements and adopted in lieu thereof a system of listings which, as tacitly understood by the parties, continued the previous contract arrangements (id., R. 9).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p22"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The appellees operate or participate in the operation of approximately forty theatres in eight states (par. 42, R. 9). They operate or control all the theatres in 'virtually all' key try-out towns, and in several important road-show towns (par. 41, R. 9).&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn-s" id="fn-s_ref"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt; Approximately fifty per cent of all the theatres in New York City are owned or operated by the Shubert appellees (pars. 15, 41, R. 3, 9).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p23"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In producing, booking, and presenting legitimate attractions, there is a constant, continuous stream of trade and commerce between the various states, consisting of assemblage of personnel and property for rehearsals, transportation of such personnel and property to various cities, making and performing contracts under which attractions are routed and presented in various states, and transmission of applications, letters, memoranda, communications, contracts, money, checks, drafts, and other media of exchange across state lines (par. 49, R. 12).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p24"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The substantial elements of appellees' conspiracy to restrain and monopolize, attempted monopolization, and monopolization have been that the appellees, by concert of action: (a) compel producers to book their legitimate attractions exclusively through appellees; (b) exclude others from booking legitimate attractions; (c) prevent competition in presentation of these attractions; (d) discriminate in favor of their own productions with respect to booking and presentation; and (e) combine their power in booking and presentation in order to maintain and strengthen their domination in each of these fields (par. 51, R. 13).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p25"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The means which the appellees have used in carrying out the foregoing acts have included the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p26"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;(1) Conditioning their investments in ligitimate attractions produced by others, and conditioning the booking of legitimate attractions in try-out towns and in New York City, upon agreement by the producers to book these attractions exclusively through appellees (pars. 52(a), (d), (e), R. 13).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p27"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;(2) Forcing producers to book their legitimate attractions for an entire theatrical season exclusively through appellees; (par. 52(c), R. 13).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p28"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;(3) Coercing producers who had booked through others to pay penalties or to accept discriminatory booking terms, as a condition of obtaining booking through them (par. 52(f), R. 13).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p29"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;(4) Entering into agreements with theatre operators whereby the operators agree to present only attractions booked through appellees, and appellees agree not to book for competing theatre operators (par. 52(g), R. 13).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Some of the effects of appellees' concerted actions have been that producers have been forced to book exclusively with appellees on non-competitive terms; persons have been denied the right to engage in the business of operating a booking office; operators of independent theatres competing with those of appellees have been systematically excluded from obtaining legitimate attractions and, in many cities have been forced out of business; in cities in which the appellees operate theatres, persons have been denied the right to engage in the business of presenting legitimate attractions, and the public has been deprived of access to legitimate attractions and the benefits which flow from open competition; and interstate commerce in production, booking, and presentation has been unreasonably restrained, and in booking and presentation has been monopolized (par. 53, R. 14).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The corporations are the United Booking Office, Inc. ('UBO'), Select Theatres Corporation ('Select'), and L.A.B. Amusement Corporation ('L.A.B.'). Since the filing of the complaint, L.A.B. has been dissolved and its assets vested in Marcus Heiman personally.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The complaint defines 'legitimate attractions' as 'stage attractions performed in person by professional actors' including 'plays, musicals, and operettas' but not ordinarily including 'stock company attractions, vaudeville, burlesque, bands, individual dancers, dance groups, concerts, and vocal or instrumental presentations.' The complaint alleges that a play costs approximately $60,000 to $100,000 to produce, whereas a musical generally requires from $200,000 to $300,000. As much as one-third of the cost, according to the complaint, may be attributable to expenditures for scenery, props, and related items and services.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn4"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; 'Booking' is defined in the complaint as 'the arrangements, generally made through a booking office, between producers and operators for the routing and presentation of legitimate attractions and the fixing of playing dates.' The complaint alleges that UBO, apart from Select and a subsidiary thereof, is the only concern in the country that books legitimate attractions throughout the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; The complaint defines 'presentation' as 'the operation of a theatre or theatres and the exhibition of legitimate attractions therein.' The defendants, according to the complaint, operate or control all the theatres in virtually all key 'tryout' cities (including Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore), all the theatres in several important 'road-show' cities (including Baltimore, Boston, cincinnati, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia), almost all the theatres in other important 'road-show' cities (Chicago and Detroit), and approximately half of the theatres in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&amp;#167; 1. * * * Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal * * *.

        &lt;p&gt;Section 4, 15 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 4, confers jurisdiction on the district courts 'to prevent and restrain violations of sections 1 7 of this title' in equity proceedings instituted under the direction of the Attorney General.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; The court issued the following order:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'In principle, I can see no valid distinction between the facts of this case and those which were before the Supreme Court in the Cases of Federal Base Ball Club of Baltimore v.

New York Yankees, decided by the Supreme Court on November 9, 1953.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Upon the authority of these adjudications the complaint in the above entitled action will be dismissed.' 120 F.Supp. 15, 16.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; Moreover, once interstate commerce is established, the Sherman Act may be applied even to 'local' restraints on that commerce. E.g., Mandeville Island Farms v. American Crystal Sugar Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x5E/mandeville-island-farms-inc-v-american-crystal-sug/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;334&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;219&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 68 S.Ct. 996, 92 L.Ed. 1328; United States v.

        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn9_ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The defendants seek to distinguish the motion picture cases on the ground that the product of the motion picture industry is 'an article of trade * * * an inanimate thing&amp;#8212;a reel of photographic film in a metal box&amp;#8212;which moves into interstate commerce like any other manufactured product'; on the other hand, according to this argument, a legitimate theatrical attraction is 'intangible and evanescent, unique and individual * * * an experience of living people.' Compare United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wVg/united-states-v-south-eastern-underwriters-assn/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;322&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;533&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 546, 64 S.Ct. 1162, 1170, 88 L.Ed. 1440: '* * * Congress can regulate traffic though it consist of intangibles.' And see Hart v. B. F. Keith Vaudeville Exchange, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/vMU/hart-v-bf-keith-vaudeville-exchange/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;262&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;271&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 43 S.Ct. 540, 67 L.Ed. 977.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That other segments of the entertainment business, besides the motion picture industry, may constitute interstate commerce is well established. See, e.g., Federal Radio Commission v. Nelson Bros. Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wmb/federal-radio-commn-v-nelson-brothers-bond-mortgag/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;289&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;266&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 279, 53 S.Ct. 627, 633, 77 L.Ed. 1166 (radio).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn10"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn10_ref"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; On remand, the trial court understood the Holmes opinion as authorizing a later dismissal if the plaintiff's evidence failed to establish that the transportation was more than 'incidental.' On that basis, the trial court dismissed the action and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 2 Cir., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca2/8D1f/hart-v-bf-keith-vaudeville-exchange/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;341&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 47 A.L.R. 775. This Court denied certiorari. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;273&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;703&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 47 S.Ct. 97, 71 L.Ed. 849. But, as the defendants admit, a denial of certiorari does not constitute an expression on the merits. Brown v. Allen, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xeC/brown-v-allen/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;344&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;443&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 489&amp;#8212;497, 73 S.Ct. 397, 437&amp;#8212;441, 97 L.Ed. 469. That rule is particularly appropriate where the decision sought to be reviewed is essentially a factual determination. Compare Graver Tank &amp;amp; Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x76/graver-tank-mfg-co-inc-et-al-v-linde-air/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;336&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;271&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 274&amp;#8212;275, 69 S.Ct. 535, 537, 93 L.Ed. 672.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For lower court decisions holding the theatrical business to be subject to the Sherman Act, see Judge Learned Hand in Marienelli v. United Booking Offices of America, D.C.S.D.N.Y., &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;227&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;165&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and Judge Charles Clark in Ring v.

But cf. San Carlo Opera Co. v.

        &lt;p&gt; The appellees control or operate the only theatre in Baltimore, the six theatres in Boston, seven of the nine theatres in Chicago, the only theatre in Cincinnati, the only theatre in Los Angeles, and the four theatres in Philadelphia (par. 42, R. 9 10). They have an interest in two of the three theatres in Detroit (par. 42 E, R. 10). The only theatre in New Haven is operated under a five-year agreement with a subsidiary of Select, which provides that the operator will accept only attractions booked through this subsidiary (par. 43, R. 11). UBO has exclusive booking rights for the only theatre in Toledo, Ohio (par. 45, R. 11).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The 'key' try-out towns are Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New Haven (par. 26, R. 4). (Footnote in original.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued November 17, 1954.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided December 6, 1954.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lynell G. Skarda&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dee C. Blythe&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Edward W. Napier&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. with him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Howard F. Houk.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a suit for treble damages, 38 Stat. 731, 15 U. S. c. &#167; 15, brought for violations of &#167; 2 (a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 49 Stat. 1526, 15 U. S. C. &#167; 13 (a),and of &#167; 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U. S. C. &#167; 13a. The jury found for petitioner; the Court of Appeals reversed, 208 F. 2d 777; and we &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*116&lt;/span&gt; granted certiorari, 347 U. S. 1012, because of the importance of the question of law presented.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner was engaged in the backery business at Santa Rosa, New Mexico, none of his activities being interstate in character. Respondent is a corporation in the baking business at Clovis, New Mexico. It is one of several corporations having interlocking ownership and managements, all in the Mead family and associates. These corporations maintain plants at Lubbock and Big Spring, Texas, and at Hobbs, Roswell, and Clovis, New Mexico. they all market their bread under the name "Mead's Fine Bread" and promote the product through a common advertising program. These corporations purchase their flour and bread wrappers as a unit. Respondent sells bread in Farwell, Texas, a town which it serves with a bread truck operating out of Clovis, New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some months, petitioner and respondent were in competition in Santa Rosa. There is evidence that, on the threat of petitioner to move his backery to another town, the local Santa Rosa merchants agreed to purchase petitioner's products exclusively. Respondent, labeling that action a boycott, cut the wholesale price of bread in Santa Rosa from 14 cents to 7 for a pound loaf and from 21 cents to 11 cents for a pound-and-a-half loaf. The Mead companies did not cut the prices of bread in &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*117&lt;/span&gt; any other town; and respondent did not cut its prices of bread in Farwell, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price war continued from September 1948 to April 1949, and as a result petitioner was forced to close his business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment for petitioner on the ground that the injury resulting from the price cutting was to a purely local competitor whose business was in no way related to interstate commerce. "If competition was lessened or a monopoly created," said the Court of Appeals, it was purely local in its scope and effect and in no way related to or affected interstate commerce." 208 F. 2d 777, 780.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U. S. C. &#167; 13 (a), provides in part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, or resale within the United States . . . and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them . . . ."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U. S. C. &#167; 13a, provides in part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, . . . to sell . . . goods in any part of the United States at prices lower than those exacted by said person elsewhere &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*118&lt;/span&gt; in the United States for the purpose of destroying competition, or eliminating a competitor in such part of the United States; or, to sell . . . goods at unreasonably low prices for the purpose of destroying competition or eliminating a competitor."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those sections on their face seem to cover the instant case. Respondent is engaged in commerce, selling bread both locally and interstate. In the course of such business, it made price discriminations, maintaining the price in the &lt;i&gt;interstate&lt;/i&gt; transactions and cutting the price in the &lt;i&gt;intrastate&lt;/i&gt; sales. The destruction of a competitor was plainly established, as required by the amended &#167; 2 (a) of the Clayton Act; and the evidence to support a finding of purpose to eliminate a competitor, as required by &#167; 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act, was ample.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals read the antitrust laws as reaching local transactions only where: (1) the local restraint has an effect on the free flow of interstate trade or commerce (&lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wickard&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Filburn,&lt;/i&gt; 317 U. S. 111); or (2) the restraint on or the monopoly of local trade is effected through the utilization of interstate mechanisms (&lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lorain Journal Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 342 U. S. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*119&lt;/span&gt; 143); or (3) local prices are fixed by the use of interstate commercial transactions (&lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Frankfort Distilleries,&lt;/i&gt; 324 U. S. 293); or (4) the discriminatory sales are to purchasers who compete in interstate commerce (&lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Corn Products Refining Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Federal Trade Commission,&lt;/i&gt; 324 U. S. 726); or (5) interstate commerce is in some other way used to destroy competition or is injured or impaired as a result of unlawful acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think that the practices in the present case are also included within the scope of the antitrust laws. We have here an interstate industry increasing its domain through outlawed competitive practices. The victim, to be sure, is only a local merchant; and no interstate transactions are used to destroy him. But the beneficiary is an interstate business; the treasury used to finance the warfare is drawn from interstate, as well as local, sources which include not only respondent but also a group of interlocked companies engaged in the same line of business; and the prices on the interstate sales, both by respondent and by the other Mead companies, are kept high while the local prices are lowered. If this method of competition were approved, the pattern for growth of monopoly would be simple. As long as the price warfare was strictly intrastate, interstate business could grow and expand with impunity at the expense of local merchants. The competitive advantage would then be with the interstate combines, not by reason of their skills or efficiency but because of their strength and ability to wage price wars. The profits made in interstate activities would underwrite the losses of local price-cutting campaigns. No instrumentality of interstate commerce would be used to destroy the local merchant and expand the domain of the combine. But the opportunities afforded by interstate commerce would be employed to injure local trade. Congress, as guardian of the Commerce Clause, certainly &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*120&lt;/span&gt; has power to say that those advantages shall not attach to the privilege of doing an interstate business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of price cutting was held to be "foreign to any legitimate commercial competition" even prior to the Robinson-Patman Act. See &lt;i&gt;Porto Rican American Tobacco Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Tobacco Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 30 F. 2d 234, 237. It seems plain to us that Congress went al least that far in the Robinson-Patman Act. As we have shown, the facts charged and found read upon the words of the statute. And the history off the Act shows it was designed to have the reach now claimed for it by petitioner. Congressman Utterback, manager of the bill in the House, included this type of case in the price cutting that he claimed was outlawed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Where, however, a manufacturer sells to customers both within the State and beyond the State, he may not favor either to the disadvantage of the other; he may not use the privilege of interstate commerce to the injury of his local trade, nor may he favor his local trade to the injury of his interstate trade. The Federal power to regulate interstate commerce is the power both to limit its employment to the injury of business within the State, and to protect interstate commerce itself from injury by influences within the State." 80 Cong. Rec. 9417.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, we think clear that Congress by the Clayton Act and Robinson-Patman Act barred the use of interstate business to destroy local business, outlawing the price cutting employed by respondent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other points are pressed on us by respondent in support of the judgment off the Court of Appeals. But we have examined them and found them not substantial. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and affirm the judgment of the District Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;So ordered.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The case first reached the court of Appeals on from a dismissal of the action at the close of plaintiff's case. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the suit was precluded by petitioner's own illegal acts which initiated the alleged price discrimination. 184 F. 2d 338. We granted a petition for certiorari, vacated that judgment, and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for further consideration in light of &lt;i&gt;Kiefer-Stewart Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Joseph E. Seagram &amp;amp; Sons,&lt;/i&gt; 340 U. S. 211. See &lt;i&gt;Moore&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mead Service Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 340 U. S. 944. On reconsideration, the Court of Appeals receded from its former position, reversed the judgment dismissing the complaint, and remanded the case for trial. 190 F. 2d 540.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Respondent contends that the so-called boycott justified its price cutting. In &lt;i&gt;Kiefer-Stewart Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Seagram &amp;amp; Sons,&lt;/i&gt; 340 U. S. 211, 214, we said, "If petitioner and others were guilty of infractions of the antitrust laws, they could be held responsible in appropriate proceedings brought against them by the Government or by injured private persons. The alleged illegal conduct of petitioner, however, could not legalize the unlawful combination by respondents nor immunize them against liability to those they injured." We need not pursue the matter, for respondent obtained a charge on this phase of the case as to which it cannot complain. The District Court charged the jury that respondent would not be liable if the price cutting was "for the purpose of regaining its own market or of reestablishing competition and not to destroy competition or to eliminate a competitor."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;No. 18.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued October 20, 1954.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided December 6, 1954.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Robert N. Gorman&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Stanley A. Silversteen. Jas. W. Hengelbrok&lt;/i&gt; entered an appearance for petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*143&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Assistant Attorney General Holland&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Marvin E. Frankel, Ellis N. Slack&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;David L. Luce.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second in the group of four cases involving income tax prosecutions under the net worth method of proof. In this case petitioner was indicted for the years 1944 through 1947, and convicted on all counts except the first, covering the year 1944.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the discussion in &lt;i&gt;Holland&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 121, is dispositive of some of the more general problems raised by this type of prosecution, petitioner here directs his fire specifically at the sufficiency of the evidence as to his opening net worth. To highlight his contention that the Government had not properly accounted for an alleged hoard of cash and bonds on hand at the beginning of the indictment period, petitioner has stipulated virtually every other net worth issue out of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although petitioner's testimony as to this cash on hand vacillated,&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; we conclude from a careful examination of the testimony that the largest amount claimed at the starting point was "far in excess" of $60,000. The Government's evidence, as in &lt;i&gt;Holland,&lt;/i&gt; did not directly dispute this, but it did painstakingly trace the Friedbergs' finances from 1922 through the prosecution years. It pointed unmistakably to the conclusion that petitioner had no such hoard of cash at the starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*144&lt;/span&gt; This evidence, briefly outlined, was as follows: Petitioner filed no tax return for 1922, paid nominal taxes for 1923, 1924 and 1925, and, except for 1926, 1927, 1930 and 1937, when he filed nontaxable returns, he filed no returns from 1926 through 1937. He borrowed small sums of money on three occasions in 1931. In 1934, when he failed to pay $30 a month on a real estate mortgage, the mortgagee brought a foreclosure suit and petitioner was unable to meet the modest compromise terms offered him by the court. In 1936 and 1940, levies on a judgment for $13.76 were returned &lt;i&gt;nulla bona.&lt;/i&gt; A mortgage on his former home was foreclosed in 1937, and a deficiency judgment entered for over $3,500. The writ of execution was returned "nothing found" in 1939, and petitioner then settled the judgment by paying $100 to the mortgagee in return for release form liability. In 1939, petitioner stated in an application for a loan that his total assets were $9,200, including $150 cash on hand, while his liabilities were $500. The tailoring business in which petitioner had worked since 1922 for an average pay of $50 a week was dissolved in 1941 because it could not meet its bills, and petitioner bought its assets for $650.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet it was during these years, from the 1920's until 1941, that petitioner claimed to have accumulated "far in excess" of $60,000. We think the jury could readily have concluded that petitioner had saved no such reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner's other objections can be disposed of quickly. First, he contends it was error for the special agent, a witness for the Government, to give his "personal opinion" that petitioner had no cash on hand at the starting point. But this distorts what actually happened. The agent was asked on cross-examination to give a "yes or no" answer to whether in his net worth statement he had credited petitioner with any cash on hand for 1941. The agent said "there was no evidence available to show there was cash." After defense counsel's insistence that the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*145&lt;/span&gt; witness answer "did you or didn't you" give credit for any cash, the court allowed the agent to explain his answer. He explained that his investigation disclosed no evidence which would permit him to credit petitioner with cash on hand in 1941 and on redirect examination he elaborated, pointing out the foreclosures and the other evidence which has been detailed above. From this, he said, he "could see no reason why [he] should . . . include" any cash on hand at the starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was hardly a "conclusion of the witness," which is an "ultimate issue to be decided by the jury," as petitioner claims. The agent, upon petitioner's insistence, was testifying to a negative fact: he had not included cash because he had found no evidence of cash. The evidence which he then summarized on redirect was only that which had already been introduced at the trial. It is difficult to see how he invaded the province of the jury; nor do we see how petitioner's question could have been answered otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, error is asserted in the trial judge's final instruction to the jury, which was given some three to four hours after it had begun its deliberations. Petitioner contends that the instruction called upon the jury to compromise the issues.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; It may be that "compromise" in its literal sense, if used alone, would leave improper connotations. Though its use here was unfortunate, we do not think it misled the jury. We note that no objection was made &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*146&lt;/span&gt; to any of the instructions, nor was any of petitioner's oral argument devoted to them a week later on motion for a new trial. In fact, petitioner specifically disclaimed any intent to make the instruction now attacked a ground for a new trial. This is persuasive evidence that he did not originally consider this section of the charge prejudicial; and since the remaining instructions were fair and negatived any inference that a compromise verdict was permissible, we are inclined to agree. In the face of this record, we can hardly conclude that this error is sufficient ground for reversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Both Friedberg and his wife testified that he had "far in excess" of $50,000 by 1936; at another point he swore he had between $50,000 and $100,000 by that time; by 1938 he claimed "far in excess" of $60,000; and finally, he stated that he had "substantially" $100,000 by 1947.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The instruction was:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Court will stand in recess until one-thirty. The Court may say to the jury at this time that I want you to make an honest and sincere effort to reach an agreement as to the merits of this case. I do not want you to shirk your duty. I want you to be fair to the Government, the United States, and the defendant. Nevertheless, this case has taken many days to try, and I hope you will make a sincere effort to compromise and adjust your differences and reach a verdict, if possible."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a civil antitrust action brought by the Government in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The defendants&#151;three corporations and two individuals&#151;are engaged in the business of promoting professional championship boxing contests.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The Government's complaint charges that the defendants, in the course of this business, have violated &#167;&#167; 1 and 2 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*238&lt;/span&gt; of the Sherman Act.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; After this Court's decision in &lt;i&gt;Toolson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York Yankees,&lt;/i&gt; 346 U. S. 356, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. The District Court granted the motion in reliance upon the &lt;i&gt;Toolson&lt;/i&gt; decision and &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;National League of Professional Baseball Clubs,&lt;/i&gt; 259 U. S. 200.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; The case, together with &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Shubert, ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 222, is here on direct appeal under the Expediting Act, 15 U. S. C. &#167; 29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government's complaint alleges that promoters of professional championship boxing contests&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"make a substantial utilization of the channels of interstate trade and commerce to:&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(a) negotiate contracts with boxers, advertising agencies, seconds, referees, judges, announcers, and other personnel living in states other than those in which the promoters reside;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(b) arrange and maintain training quarters in states other than those in which the promoters reside;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*239&lt;/span&gt; "(c) lease suitable arenas, and arrange other details for boxing contests, particularly when the contests are held in states other than those in which the promoters reside;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(d) sell tickets to contests across state lines;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(e) negotiate for the sale of and sell rights to make and distribute motion pictures of boxing contests to the 18,000 theatres in the United States;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(f) negotiate for the sale of and sell rights to broadcast and telecast boxing contests to homes through more than 3,000 radio stations and 100 television stations in the United States; and&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(g) negotiate for the sale of and sell rights to telecast boxing contests to some 200 motion picture theatres in various states of the United States for display by large-screen television."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promoter's receipts from the sale of television, radio, and motion picture rights to championship matches, according to the complaint, represent on the average over 25% of the promoter's total revenue and in some instances exceed the revenue derived from the sale of admission tickets.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; The complaint alleges that the defendants have restrained and monopolized this trade and commerce&#151; "the promotion, exhibition, broadcasting, telecasting, and motion picture production and distribution of professional championship boxing contests in the United States"&#151; through a conspiracy to exclude competition in their line of business. The conspiracy, it is claimed, began in 1949 with an agreement among the defendants and Joe Louis, then heavyweight champion of the world, that Louis would resign his title, that he would procure exclusive &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*240&lt;/span&gt; rights to the services of the four leading title contenders in a series of elimination contests which would result in the recognition of a new heavyweight champion, that he would also obtain exclusive rights to broadcast, televise, and film these contests, and that he would assign all such exclusive rights to the defendants. The defendants have allegedly sought to maintain and effectuate this conspiracy by the following means: by eliminating the "leading competing promoter" of championship matches; by acquiring the exclusive right to promote professional boxing contests in all the "principal arenas" where championship matches can be successfully presented; and by requiring each title contender to agree, as a condition of fighting for the championship, that if he wins he would, for a period of three (and sometimes five) years, take part only in title contests promoted by the defendants. As a consequence of these acts, the complaint alleges, the defendants have promoted, or participated in the promotion of, all but two of the 21 championship matches held in the United States between June 1949 and the filing of the complaint in March 1952.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These allegations must of course be taken as true at this stage of the proceeding. And the defendants do not deny that the allegations state a cause of action if their business is subject to the Sherman Act. The question thus presented is whether the defendants' business as described in the complaint&#151;the promotion of professional championship boxing contests on a multistate basis, coupled with the sale of rights to televise, broadcast, and film the contests for interstate transmission&#151;constitutes "trade or commerce among the several States" within the meaning of the Sherman Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is perhaps a novel one in that this Court has never before considered the antitrust status of the boxing business. Yet, if it were not for &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Toolson,&lt;/i&gt; we think that it would be too clear for dispute &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*241&lt;/span&gt; that the Government's allegations bring the defendants within the scope of the Act. A boxing match&#151;like the showing of a motion picture (&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Crescent Amusement Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 323 U. S. 173, 183) or the performance of a vaudeville act (&lt;i&gt;Hart&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;B. F. Keith Vaudeville Exchange,&lt;/i&gt; 262 U. S. 271) or the performance of a legitimate stage attraction (&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Shubert, ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 222)&#151;"is of course a local affair." But that fact alone does not bar application of the Sherman Act to a business based on the promotion of such matches, if the business is itself engaged in interstate commerce or if the business imposes illegal restraints on interstate commerce. Apart from &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Toolson,&lt;/i&gt; it would be sufficient, we believe, to rest on the allegation that over 25% of the revenue from championship boxing is derived from interstate operations through the sale of radio, television, and motion picture rights.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; Compare &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Yellow Cab Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 332 U. S. 218, 225-226; &lt;i&gt;Times-Picayune Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 594, 602, n. 11; &lt;i&gt;Mandeville Island Farms&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Crystal Sugar Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 334 U. S. 219, 227-235; &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Frankfort Distilleries,&lt;/i&gt; 324 U. S. 293, 297-298; &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Women's Sportswear Mfrs. Assn.,&lt;/i&gt; 336 U. S. 460, 464; &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Employing Plasterers Assn.,&lt;/i&gt; 347 U. S. 186, 189; and cases collected in the &lt;i&gt;Shubert&lt;/i&gt; opinion. See also &lt;i&gt;Currin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wallace,&lt;/i&gt; 306 U. S. 1, 10; &lt;i&gt;Wickard&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Filburn,&lt;/i&gt; 317 U. S. 111, 127-128.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding these decisions, the defendants contend that they are exempt from the Sherman Act under the rule of &lt;i&gt;stare decisis.&lt;/i&gt; They, like the defendants in the &lt;i&gt;Shubert&lt;/i&gt; case, base this contention on &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Toolson.&lt;/i&gt; But they would be content with a more &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*242&lt;/span&gt; restrictive interpretation of &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Toolson&lt;/i&gt; than the defendants in the &lt;i&gt;Shubert&lt;/i&gt; case. The &lt;i&gt;Shubert&lt;/i&gt; defendants argue that &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Toolson&lt;/i&gt; immunized all businesses built around the live presentation of local exhibitions. The defendants in the instant case argue that &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Toolson&lt;/i&gt; immunized only such businesses as involve exhibitions of an athletic nature. We cannot accept either argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the reasons stated in the &lt;i&gt;Toolson&lt;/i&gt; opinion and restated in &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Shubert, ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 222, &lt;i&gt;Toolson&lt;/i&gt; neither overruled &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball&lt;/i&gt; nor necessarily reaffirmed all that was said in &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball.&lt;/i&gt; Instead, "[w]ithout re-examination of the underlying issues," the Court adhered to &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball&lt;/i&gt; "so far as that decision determines that Congress had no intention of including the business of baseball within the scope of the federal antitrust laws." 346 U. S., at 357. We have held today in the &lt;i&gt;Shubert&lt;/i&gt; case that &lt;i&gt;Toolson&lt;/i&gt; is not authority for exempting other businesses merely because of the circumstance that they are also based on the performance of local exhibitions. That ruling is fully applicable here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, none of the factors underlying the &lt;i&gt;Toolson&lt;/i&gt; decision are present in the instant case. At the time the Government's complaint was filed, no court had ever held that the boxing business was not subject to the antitrust laws.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; Indeed, this Court's decision in the &lt;i&gt;Hart&lt;/i&gt; case, less than a year after the &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball&lt;/i&gt; decision, clearly established that &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball&lt;/i&gt; could not be relied upon as a basis of exemption for other segments of the entertainment business, athletic or otherwise. Surely there is &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*243&lt;/span&gt; nothing in the Holmes opinion in the &lt;i&gt;Hart&lt;/i&gt; case to suggest, even remotely, that the Court was drawing a line between athletic and nonathletic entertainment. Nor do we see the relevance of such a distinction for the purpose of determining what constitutes "trade or commerce among the several States." The controlling consideration in &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Hart&lt;/i&gt; was, instead, a very practical one&#151;the degree of interstate activity involved in the particular business under review. It follows that &lt;i&gt;stare decisis&lt;/i&gt; cannot help the defendants here; for, contrary to their argument, &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball&lt;/i&gt; did not hold that all business based on professional sports were outside the scope of the antitrust laws. The issue confronting us is, therefore, not whether a previously granted exemption should continue, but whether an exemption should be granted in the first instance. And that issue is for Congress to resolve, not this Court. See &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;South-Eastern Underwriters Assn.,&lt;/i&gt; 322 U. S. 533, 561.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue was, in fact, before Congress only recently. In 1951, four identical bills were introduced in Congress&#151; three in the House and one in the Senate&#151;forbidding the application of the antitrust laws "to organized professional sports enterprises or to acts in the conduct of such enterprises."&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; Extensive hearings on the three House bills were conducted by the Subcommittee on Study of Monopoly Power of the Committee on the Judiciary; no hearings were held on the Senate bill.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; At the conclusion &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*244&lt;/span&gt; of its hearings, the House Subcommittee unanimously declared its opposition to the four bills. Its report states:&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The requested exemption would extend to all professional sports enterprises and to all acts in the conduct of such enterprises. The law would no longer require competition in any facet of business activity of any sport enterprise. Thus &lt;i&gt;the sale of radio and television rights, the management of stadia,&lt;/i&gt; the purchase and sale of advertising, the concession industry, and many other business activities, as well as the aspects of baseball which are solely related to the promotion of competition on the playing field, would be immune and untouchable. &lt;i&gt;Such a broad exemption could not be granted without substantially repealing the antitrust laws.&lt;/i&gt;" (Italics added.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to baseball, the Subcommittee recommended a postponement of any legislation until the status of &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball&lt;/i&gt; was clarified in the courts.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; No further action was taken on any of the bills; Congress thus left intact the then-existing coverage of the antitrust laws. Yet the defendants in the instant case are now asking this Court for precisely the same exemption which enactment of those bills would have afforded. Their remedy, if they are entitled to one, lies in further resort to Congress, as we have already stated. For we agree that "Such a broad exemption could not be granted without substantially repealing the antitrust laws."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the &lt;i&gt;Shubert&lt;/i&gt; case, we are concerned here only with the sufficiency of the Government's complaint. We hold &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*245&lt;/span&gt; that the complaint states a cause of action and that the Government is entitled to an opportunity to prove its allegations. The judgment of the court below is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BURTON, retaining the views expressed in his dissent in the &lt;i&gt;Toolson&lt;/i&gt; case, 346 U. S. 356, 357, joins the opinion and judgment of the Court in this case. MR. JUSTICE REED joins in this concurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[For dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE MINTON, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 251.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint describes the "Nature of Trade and Commerce Involved" as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. Boxers usually compete in amateur tournaments as a preliminary to becoming professionals. As amateurs they receive no pay and box under the sponsorship of local independent boxing clubs, associations or other organizations. When they become professionals, they contract to box an opponent on a per bout basis for local promoters and receive a fee. If their skill as professional boxers results in an increasing willingness of the public to pay to view their contests, they can demand higher fees and a greater percentage of receipts from the sale of tickets and other rights. If their skill increases, they engage in preliminary and other bouts throughout the United States and eventually participate in major bouts. The fee for a major bout is usually a sum guaranteed by the promoter or a predetermined percentage of the net receipts from the sale of tickets and motion picture, radio and television rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11. The most lucrative asset to a professional boxer is recognition and designation by the various state athletic &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*246&lt;/span&gt; commissions and others as "world champion" in the division in which he competes. These divisions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    flyweight .................... 112 lbs.
    bantamweight ................. 118  "
    featherweight ................ 126  "
    lightweight .................. 135  "
    welterweight ................. 147  "
    middleweight ................. 160  "
    light heavyweight ............ 175  "
    heavyweight .................. All above 175 lbs.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A "world champion" gains his title by defeating the existing champion or by eliminating all contenders, and remains world champion in his division until he is, in turn, defeated by a contender or resigns the title. Such a title affords to its holder financial returns from personal appearances and exhibitions throughout the United States, from endorsements and other activities, as well as a greater percentage of the receipts from his bouts. The promotion of professional championship boxing contests is also more lucrative than the promotion of other boxing contests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12. Of the various "world championships," the heavyweight division is the most important to boxers and promoters, as it returns the greatest financial benefits. The flyweight and bantamweight divisions are not of substantial importance in the United States because very few American boxers are of such light weights. No championship contest has been held in the flyweight division in the United States since 1935; none in the bantamweight division since 1947.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13. The promotion of professional championship boxing contests, in which the winners achieve "world champion" titles, includes negotiating and executing contracts with boxers for the main and preliminary bouts, arranging and maintaining training quarters, leasing suitable arenas, such as stadia or ball parks where substantial numbers of the public may be seated to view the contest, negotiating and executing contracts for the employment of matchmakers, advertising agencies, press agents, seconds, referees, judges, announcers and other personnel; organizing, assembling, and arranging other details necessary to the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*247&lt;/span&gt; exhibition of the contests; selling tickets and rights to make motion pictures of the contests and to distribute them throughout the United States and in foreign countries; and selling rights to transmit the contests by radio or television throughout the United States and foreign countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14. Promoters of professional championship boxing contests make a substantial utilization of the channels of interstate trade and commerce to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(a) negotiate contracts with boxers, advertising agencies, seconds, referees, judges, announcers, and other professional living in states other than those in which the promoters reside;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(b) arrange and maintain training quarters in states other than those in which the promoters reside;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(c) lease suitable arenas, and arrange other details for boxing contests, particularly when the contests are held in the states other than those in which the promoters reside;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(d) sell tickets to contests across state lines;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(e) negotiate for the sale of and sell rights to make and distribute motion pictures of boxing contests to the 18,000 theatres in the United States;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(f) negotiate for the sale of and sell rights to broadcast and telecast boxing contests to homes through more than 3,000 radio stations and 100 television stations in the United States; and&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(g) negotiate for the sale of and sell rights to telecast boxing contests to some 200 motion picture theatres in various states of the United States for display by large-screen television.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15. Motion picture films of professional championship boxing contests are distributed and exhibited in theatres throughout the United States and in foreign countries. Similarly, radio and television broadcasts of such contests are transmitted throughout the United States and radio broadcasts of them are also transmitted to foreign countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16. The 21 major professional championship boxing contests promoted in the United States since June 1949 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*248&lt;/span&gt; have produced a gross income from admissions and the sale of motion picture, radio and television rights of approximately $4,500,000.00. The total such gross income for all professional boxing contests in the United States during this period, including the championship contests, has been approximately $15,000,000.00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 (a). A promoter of a professional championship fight usually derives substantially all of his revenue from two sources: (a) sale of tickets of admission and (b) sale of rights to telecast, broadcast and produce and distribute motion pictures of the fight. In such fights, sale of television, radio and motion picture rights account for a substantial proportion of the promoter's total revenue. Since 1949 sale of these rights has represented, on the average, over 25% of the total revenue derived from championship fights, and has exceeded, in some instances, the revenue received from sale of tickets of admission. With the progressive and continuing expansion of television facilities, the proportion of the promoter's total revenue derived from television, radio and motion pictures, has been on an ascending curve, in relation to revenue derived from sale of tickets of admission. In the Marciano-Walcott heavy-weight championship fight of May 15, 1953, at Chicago, Illinois, promoted by defendants IBC (N. Y.), IBC (Ill.), James D. Norris and Arthur M. Wirtz, the promoters' receipts from sale of tickets of admission were, after federal admission taxes, $253,462.37, while their television, radio and motion picture revenue was approximately $300,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, with whom MR. JUSTICE MINTON joins, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would baffle the subtlest ingenuity to find a single differentiating factor between other sporting exhibitions, whether boxing or football or tennis, and baseball insofar as the conduct of the sport is relevant to the criteria or considerations by which the Sherman Law becomes applicable to a "trade or commerce." &#167; 1, 26 Stat. 209, 15 U. S. C. &#167; 1. Indeed, the interstate aspects of baseball &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*249&lt;/span&gt; and the extent of the exploitation of baseball through mass media are far more extensive than is true of boxing.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; If the intrinsic applicability of the Sherman Law were the issue, no attempt would be made to differentiate the two sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1922, the Court found commercialized baseball outside the scope of the Sherman Law. &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball Club&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;National League,&lt;/i&gt; 259 U. S. 200. Last Term the Court refused to re-examine "the underlying issues" of this adjudication and adhered to it. &lt;i&gt;Toolson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York Yankees, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 346 U. S. 356. What were the "underlying issues"? They were the constituents of baseball in relation to the Sherman Law. By adhering to that decision, the Court refused to depart from a judgment necessarily based on these constituent elements. To my understanding, that is what is meant by "[w]ithout re-examination of the underlying issues." The Court decided as it did in the &lt;i&gt;Toolson&lt;/i&gt; case as an application of the doctrine of &lt;i&gt;stare decisis.&lt;/i&gt; That doctrine is not, to be sure, an imprisonment of reason. But neither is it a whimsy. It can hardly be that this Court gave a preferred position to baseball because it is the great American sport. I do not suppose that the Court would treat the national anthem differently from other songs if the nature of a song became relevant to adjudication. If &lt;i&gt;stare decisis&lt;/i&gt; be one aspect of law, as it is, to disregard it in identic situations is mere caprice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress, on the other hand, may yield to sentiment and be capricious, subject only to due process. As a matter of fact, one of the explicit factors that led to the result in &lt;i&gt;Toolson&lt;/i&gt; was the recognition of congressional refusal to upset &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*250&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball&lt;/i&gt; decision. But as the Government with commendable candor recognizes, Congress was not asked to avert the threat of litigation against baseball by providing a specific exemption of that sport from the provisions of the Sherman Law. The sponsors of this relief did not ask immunity for baseball as such. The "legislation" to which reference was made in the &lt;i&gt;Toolson&lt;/i&gt; case consisted of bills which sought exemption for "organized professional sports enterprises [and] acts in the conduct of such enterprises." (H. R. 4229, 4230, 4231, and S. 1526, 82d Cong., 1st Sess.) Since, in the light of all the circumstances, &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball&lt;/i&gt; was left undisturbed by &lt;i&gt;Toolson,&lt;/i&gt; I cannot bring myself to construe the respect that was thus accorded to &lt;i&gt;stare decisis&lt;/i&gt; to be narrower than that all situations identic with what was passed on in the &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball&lt;/i&gt; case should be covered by it. I cannot translate even the narrowest conception of &lt;i&gt;stare decisis&lt;/i&gt; into the equivalent of writing into the Sherman Law an exemption of baseball to the exclusion of every other sport different not one legal jot or title from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between them, this case and &lt;i&gt;Shubert&lt;/i&gt; illustrate that nice but rational distinctions are inevitable in adjudication. I agree with the Court's opinion in &lt;i&gt;Shubert&lt;/i&gt; for precisely the reason that constrains me to dissent in this case. Within a year after &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball&lt;/i&gt; the Court, again unanimously and through the same writer, found that a bill against the show business based on the Sherman Law was not so frivolous as to call for dismissal. &lt;i&gt;Hart&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;B. F. Keith Vaudeville Exchange,&lt;/i&gt; 262 U. S. 271. For more than 30 years, therefore, these two decisions stood as the law. The &lt;i&gt;Shubert&lt;/i&gt; case plainly falls within the adjudication of &lt;i&gt;Hart.&lt;/i&gt; By the same process of reasoning, boxing falls within &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball,&lt;/i&gt; which this Court revitalized in &lt;i&gt;Toolson&lt;/i&gt; despite all the new factors on which the dissent in &lt;i&gt;Toolson&lt;/i&gt; relied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*251&lt;/span&gt; Whatever unsavory elements there be in boxing contests is quite beside the mark. The States to which these exhibitions are distasteful are possessed of the honorable and effective remedy of self-help. They need not sanction pugilistic exhibitions, or may sanction them only under conditions that safeguard their notions of the public welfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE MINTON, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a case under the Sherman Act, two things among others are essential: (1) there must be trade or commerce; (2) such trade or commerce must be among the States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball&lt;/i&gt; case, 259 U. S. 200, this Court held that baseball was not trade or commerce. It said, "personal effort, not related to production, is not a subject of commerce," and since the baseball game was an exhibition wholly intrastate, there could be no trade or commerce among the States. 259 U. S. 200, 209.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;i&gt;Baseball&lt;/i&gt; case, this Court held that traveling from State to State to play the game and all the details of arrangements were incident to the exhibition. In &lt;i&gt;Toolson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York Yankees,&lt;/i&gt; 346 U. S. 356, we did not overrule the &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball&lt;/i&gt; decision; in fact, we reaffirmed the holding of that case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When boxers travel from State to State, carrying their shorts and fancy dressing robes in a ditty bag in order to participate in a boxing bout, which is wholly intrastate, it is now held by this Court that the boxing bout becomes interstate commerce. What this Court held in the &lt;i&gt;Federal Baseball&lt;/i&gt; case to be incident to the exhibition now becomes more important than the exhibition. This is as fine an example of the tail wagging the dog as can be conjured up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*252&lt;/span&gt; We are not dealing here with the question of whether the appellees have restrained trade in or monopolized the radio and television industries. That is a separate consideration. What others do with pictures they are allowed to take of a wholly local spectacle or exhibition by thereafter using the channels of interstate commerce to exhibit them does not make a package deal. The appellees have nothing to do with the transmission of sound or the pictures. Because these incidents are not directly involved, no effort was made to bring the radio and television companies and the sponsors into the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court says: "The conspiracy, it is claimed, began in 1949 with an agreement among the defendants and Joe Louis, then heavyweight champion of the world, that Louis would resign his title, . . . procure exclusive rights to the services of the four leading title contenders in a series of elimination contests which would result in the recognition of a new heavyweight champion, . . . and . . . assign all such exclusive rights to the defendants." Of course, there was at the time only one champion, Joe Louis. He had a monopoly on that, and while he got it by competition, he did not get it in trade or commerce. I do not suppose that Joe Louis had to go back into the ring and be walloped to a knockout or a decision before he could surrender his championship. And if he arranged with four other fellows to fight it out in elimination contests for the championship and no one else was restrained from doing the same, it is difficult for me to see how there was any conspiracy. If other promoters wanted to start an elimination contest, they were free to do so. Whether they received public acceptance depended upon something other than trade or commerce. What does a boxer or athlete have for sale but "personal effort, not related to production," which, as Justice Holmes said, is not commerce? Such services they may contract about free from any control of the Sherman Act. Suppose the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*253&lt;/span&gt; appellee did, as the Court states, control what the parties called all but two of twenty-one championship contests, what trade or commerce have they restrained?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I see it, boxing is not trade or commerce. There can be no monopoly or restraint of nonexistent commerce or trade. Whether Congress can control baseball and boxing I need not speculate. What I am saying is that Congress has not attempted to do so. If there is a conspiracy, it is not one to control commerce between the States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued November 15, 1954.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided February 7, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Assistant Attorney General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Burger, Oscar H. Davis, Paul A. Sweeney&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Herman Marcuse.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;W. R. Ashburn&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case the United States District Court directed a verdict for respondent because petitioner failed to present evidence of either a breach of contract or resulting damages sufficient to sustain a verdict for petitioner. The &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*297&lt;/span&gt; Court of Appeals, however, affirmed the judgment on the ground that the alleged contract was unenforceable. For the reasons hereafter stated, we agree with the District Court that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the alleged breach of contract. Accordingly, we do not reach or pass upon the other grounds discussed by the Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1948, the crops of Irish potatoes in the United States and Canada were among the largest on record. As a result, the United States, in &#167; 1 (b) of the Agricultural Act of 1948, 62 Stat. 1247, 1248, obligated itself to support the sale of such potatoes at 90% of their parity price. This program was carried out through agreements of the Commodity Credit Corporation to purchase, from eligible growers or dealers in the United States, all Irish potatoes harvested before January 1, 1949, provided such potatoes could not be sold commercially at 90% of parity. As the unsupported Canadian prices were lower than the supported prices in the United States, it became profitable to import Canadian potatoes despite the tariff and freight charges. Recognizing that fact, Congress authorized investigations by the Tariff Commission, under the President's direction, which might lead to imposing quantitative limitations on imports or to increasing import fees. 62 Stat. 1248-1250, 7 U. S. C. &#167; 624.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, without resorting to that procedure, the United States acted through diplomatic channels. Its Acting Secretary of State and the Canadian Ambassador exchanged notes on November 23, 1948, purporting to consummate an executive agreement effective at once. For their text see Appendix, &lt;i&gt;infra,&lt;/i&gt; at 305-309. Of special significance to this litigation are the undertakings made by Canada, in its note, to place its Irish potatoes under export control, to withhold export permits for the movement of table stock potatoes to the United States, and to issue export permits for the shipment of Canadian certified &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*298&lt;/span&gt; seed potatoes to the United States only under specified circumstances. Those circumstances were that the shipments be limited to specified States where there was a legitimate demand for certified seed potatoes and to a short period before the normal seeding time. Permits were to be granted only to exporters having firm orders from legitimate United States users of Canadian seed potatoes, and those exporters were "to have included in any contract into which they might enter with a United States seed potato importer a clause in which the importer would give an assurance that the potatoes would not be diverted or reconsigned for table stock purposes." Appendix, &lt;i&gt;infra,&lt;/i&gt; at 306. The agreement terminated June 20, 1949.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 1948, Guy W. Capps, Inc., a Virginia corporation, respondent herein, bought 48,544 one-hundred-pound bags of Canadian certified Irish seed potatoes from H. B. Willis, Inc., of Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, a Canadian exporter. Before the exporter's shipment of them on the S. S. &lt;i&gt;Empire Gangway&lt;/i&gt; to respondent at Jacksonville, Florida, respondent wired the exporter as follows: "Certified seed potatoes loaded on S. S. &lt;i&gt;Gangway&lt;/i&gt; are for planting in Florida and Georgia." The shipment arrived at Jacksonville January 9, 1949.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; On &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*299&lt;/span&gt; January 11, the potatoes were all invoiced by respondent to the Atlantic Commission Company at Jacksonville as "48,544 Sax Canada No. 1 Seed Potatoes @ $3.35 f. o. b."&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 1951, the United States filed the instant action against respondent in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, claiming that the above circumstances constituted a contract between the exporter and respondent for the benefit of the United States. The complaint alleged further, upon information and belief, that, in January 1949, respondent, in violation of such contract, "sold the 48,544 sacks of seed potatoes for table stock purposes" to the damage of the United States in the amount of approximately $150,486, "in that for each quantity of potatoes so imported from Canada and sold for table stock in the United States, a substantially equivalent quantity of potatoes produced in the United States was offered for sale to the Department of Agriculture, and had to be and was purchased by the Department under the Agricultural Act of 1948."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent's motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted was denied. 100 F. Supp. 30. However, at the close of petitioner's case and after argument of counsel, the court directed a verdict for respondent. Judgment was entered accordingly. The court's findings of fact and conclusions &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*300&lt;/span&gt; of law were contained in its oral opinion. That opinion, which has not been published, included the following highly significant statements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The action here is for breach of contract made between a Canadian exporter and Capps, the American importer, and specifically of a stipulation placed in that contract which the Court has held was for the benefit of the United States.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The expression constituting that stipulation is that certified seed potatoes loaded on the S. S. &lt;i&gt;Gangway&lt;/i&gt; are for planting in Florida and Georgia. Now, assuming that the Court is correct in holding that that stipulation is an agreement within the meaning of the Executive Treaty or an assurance, as it is called in the Executive Treaty, to the effect that the potatoes would not be diverted or reconsigned for table stock purposes&#151;I say assuming that the Court is correct in holding that this provision is an assurance, there is no proof here sufficient to go to the jury that there has been such a diversion or reconsignment, or that there has been a lack of diligence or care on the part of this defendant to see to it that its assurance was carried out.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the first place, the only diversion or reconsignment was from the defendant to the Atlantic Commission Company. Now that was not a diversion or reconsignment for table stock purposes. Nor does it evidence any want of care on the part of the defendant to see that the assurance was kept, because the evidence shows that this defendant had from year to year sold to Atlantic, potatoes exclusively for seed purposes. The evidence does not justify or would not justify the jury in drawing a conclusion that it was a reckless abandonment by the defendant of its obligation to see to the use of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*301&lt;/span&gt; these potatoes because the defendant had the right to rely upon its previous experiences.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"But going further, and assuming that it was incumbent upon the defendant to follow up and see that this reconsignment did not lead to the use of the potatoes for table purposes, we find that the A &amp;amp; P, to whom Atlantic sold, did sell seed potatoes. It is true that it was not its entire trade in potatoes, but it did sell a large amount, described as its secondary function, for seed purposes, and the other sales by Atlantic to wholesalers or to the trade, as it is spoken of, were to firms which used potatoes for seed purposes or disposed of them for seed purposes, so that the sales by the defendant here were equally consistent with the compliance as with the violation of the assurance."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals disagreed with the District Court on the above points.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; However, it affirmed the judgment on the ground that the international agreement, which the contract between respondent and the exporter sought to carry out, was void. The court regarded it as not authorized by Congress and as contravening the provision for procedure through the Tariff Commission. The court also held that the suit must fail because no cause of action had been created by Congress for this type of injury. 204 F. 2d 655, 658-661. We granted certiorari to determine whether the significant constitutional and statutory questions discussed by the Court of Appeals were necessary for the decision of the case and, if so, to give them consideration. 346 U. S. 884.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have first examined the record in order to pass upon the preliminary questions on which the Court of Appeals &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*302&lt;/span&gt; disagreed with the trial court. See &lt;i&gt;Walling&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;General Industries Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 330 U. S. 545, 547, 550, and see also, &lt;i&gt;Story Parchment Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Paterson Parchment Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 282 U. S. 555, 560, 567-568.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent's alleged obligation is stated in its first telegram, which must be read in the light of the above-mentioned correspondence between the United States and Canada. That correspondence recognized that importations of Canadian seed potatoes, as well as of Canadian table stock potatoes, might displace eligible American potatoes in American commercial markets and thus might add to the burden of the American price-support program. The correspondence, nevertheless, did not seek to exclude Canadian seed potatoes. On the contrary, it provided for the continuance of shipments of seed potatoes to specified States in the United States, during a short period immediately prior to the normal seeding time. In addition, Canada agreed to require its exporters to secure assurance from each importer of Canadian seed potatoes that such potatoes would not be diverted or reconsigned for table stock purposes. In effect, this agreement stopped the regular Canadian-American trade in Canadian table stock potatoes, while preserving such trade in Canadian seed potatoes. There was no suggestion that each importer, during the short open season for Canadian seed potatoes, had to take any new or extraordinary affirmative steps to see to it that the ultimate purchasers never ate their seed potatoes, or that each American retailer of Canadian seed potatoes, in its usual course of business, segregated such potatoes from table stock potatoes in any manner not customary in the sale of seed potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The undisputed evidence showed that the entire shipment to Jacksonville was made in containers with markings and tags identifying the potatoes as "Canadian No. 1 seed potatoes." There was no showing that this identification &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*303&lt;/span&gt; was separated from the potatoes at any point short of the ultimate offering of some of the potatoes at retail. There was, in short, no evidence that any of the potatoes were at any time reconsigned or otherwise treated except as had been customary in prior commercial dealings in seed potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Jacksonville the entire shipment was invoiced by respondent to the Atlantic Commission Company as "Canada No. 1 Seed Potatoes." Most of the 10,000 sacks (which, at the time of their delivery to that company in Jacksonville, were resold by it to respondent) were invoiced by respondent to other customers in a like manner.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; The Atlantic Commission Company, in turn, invoiced to its purchasers, in the same manner, the sacks which it received from respondent. Of them, 13,627 sacks were invoiced by the Commission Company to its parent company, the Great Atlantic &amp;amp; Pacific Tea Company, at three points in Florida and one in Georgia, but 1,641 sacks were invoiced to points in Alabama. The Great Atlantic &amp;amp; Pacific Tea Company primarily sold foodstuffs but also dealt in vegetables for planting purposes, such as seed potatoes, onion sets and cabbage sets. It sold seed potatoes not only to home gardeners but to planters of small commercial acreages. The Commission Company invoiced the remaining 24,926 sacks to over 30 separate dealers in Florida and Georgia, but invoiced 2,309 to points in Alabama. All of the consignees were dealers in vegetables and groceries, and the primary volume of their trade was in articles for food. But there was testimony that some of these dealers customarily handled seed potatoes for planting purposes and there was no evidence that any of them did not. Respondent previously had sold seed potatoes to the Atlantic Commission Company and that company had used channels of distribution comparable &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*304&lt;/span&gt; to those used in this instance. There was no evidence of the reconsignment of any of these seed potatoes for table stock, or of the diversion of any of them from the commercial channels theretofore usually used for sales of seed potatoes in this area during the planting season. Exception has not been taken to the States designated or to the times when the sales were to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence also did not support the suggestion that some of these potatoes were unsuitable for planting in the areas designated. It was not enough that one witness said that only 20% of the original shipment consisted of potatoes belonging to the three most popular varieties grown in Florida in that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no evidence of bad faith, neglect or carelessness on the part of respondent in performing its contractual obligations. There was no evidence of any intent of respondent that the potatoes be sold for table use. It freely acknowledged the existence of the international agreement and declared its purpose to cooperate with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was conceded that these potatoes were specially suited for use as seed but also that they were of high-grade edible quality. There was, however, no evidence that any substantial part of these potatoes ultimately was eaten. The most that appeared was that ten pounds of the seed potatoes were sold by a grocery in St. Augustine, Florida, to two women who appeared to be housewives buying for home use. There was also evidence that a few potatoes, probably from the shipment, were sold to customers of the same type by a Jacksonville store and by an A &amp;amp; P market in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, all that respondent did was to sell seed potatoes, labeled as seed potatoes, in seeding time to concerns which normally dealt in seed potatoes. Under these circumstances, the District Court was not clearly in error in making the findings it did or in directing the verdict for respondent on the ground that no breach of contract &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*305&lt;/span&gt; was shown. &lt;i&gt;Walling&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;General Industries Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 330 U. S. 545.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In view of the foregoing, there is no occasion for us to consider the other questions discussed by the Court of Appeals. The decision in this case does not rest upon them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"SIR,
&lt;p&gt;"I have the honour to refer to the discussions which have taken place between the representatives of the Government of Canada and of the Government of the United States of America regarding the problems which would confront the Government of the United States in the operation of its price support and other programmes for potatoes if the imports of Canadian potatoes, during this current crop year, were to continue to be unrestricted. After careful consideration of the various representations which have been made to the Canadian Government on this subject, the Canadian Government is prepared to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"1. Include Irish potatoes in the list of commodities for which an export permit is required under the provisions of the Export and Import Permits Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*306&lt;/span&gt; "2. Withhold export permits for the movement of table stock potatoes to the United States proper, excluding Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"3. Issue export permits for the shipment of Canadian certified seed potatoes to the United States, but only under the following circumstances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(a) Export permits will be issued to Canadian exporters for shipments to specified States in the United States and such permits will only be granted within the structure of a specific schedule. The schedule is designed to direct the shipment of Canadian certified seed potatoes into those States where there is a legitimate demand for certified seed potatoes and only during a short period immediately prior to the normal seeding time. A draft of this schedule is now being jointly prepared by Canadian and United States officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(b) Export permits would only be granted to Canadian exporters who could give evidence that they had firm orders from legitimate United States users of Canadian seed potatoes. Canadian exporters would also be required to have included in any contract into which they might enter with a United States seed potato importer a clause in which the importer would give an assurance that the potatoes would not be diverted or reconsigned for table stock purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(c) The Canadian Government would survey the supply of Canadian certified seed potatoes by class and consider the possibility of giving precedence to the export of Foundation and Foundation A classes of certified seed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(d) The names and addresses of the consignees entered on the export permit would be compiled periodically and this information would be forwarded to the United States Government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In instituting a system which has the effect of restricting exports of Canadian potatoes to the United States, the Canadian Government recognizes a responsibility to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*307&lt;/span&gt; the Canadian commercial grower in certain surplus potato areas and is prepared to guarantee a minimum return on gradable potatoes for which the grower cannot find a sales outlet. Although the details of such a programme have not been finalized, it is anticipated that the Canadian Government will announce, at approximately the same time as potatoes are placed under export control, a floor price which will be effective April 1st, 1949 for certain carlot shipping areas in the East. To implement this programme the Canadian Government would inspect the potato holdings of commercial growers in Prince Edward Island, and several counties of New Brunswick, on or after April 1st and would undertake to pay a fixed price for every hundred pounds of Canada No. 1 potatoes found in the bins. It is not anticipated that any actual payment would be made at that time and it would be understood that if any of the potatoes examined were subsequently sold or used for seed purposes the owner would forfeit any claim for assistance on such potatoes. In other words, the Canadian Government would make no payment on potatoes which move into export trade, or which are used for seed purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It should be noted that the Canadian proposals to institute export permit control on Canadian potatoes and to inaugurate a price support programme are contingent upon assurances from the United States Government that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"a) The United States Government will not hereafter impose any quantitative limitations or fees on Canadian potatoes of the 1948 crop exported to the United States under the system of regulating the movement of potatoes from Canada to the United States outlined herein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"b) The Canadian Government proposal, as outlined herein, to guarantee a floor price to certain commercial growers in the Maritime Provinces would not be interpreted by United States authorities as either a direct or &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*308&lt;/span&gt; indirect subsidy and that in consequence there would be no grounds for the imposition of countervailing duties under Section 303 of the United States Tariff Act of 1930.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If the United States Government in its replying note accepts the Canadian proposals and gives to the Canadian Government the assurances required, as outlined above, this note and the reply thereto will constitute an agreement on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Government of the United States appreciates the assurance of the Government of Canada contained in your note no. 538 of November 23, 1948, that the Government of Canada is prepared, contingent upon the receipt of certain assurances from the Government of the United States, to establish the controls outlined therein over the exportation of potatoes from Canada to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In view of the adverse effect which unrestricted imports of Canadian potatoes would have on the potato programs of the United States and the fact that it is anticipated that the Canadian proposal will substantially reduce the quantity of potatoes which would otherwise be imported into the United States, and in the interest of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*309&lt;/span&gt; international trade between the United States and Canada and other considerations, the United States Government assures the Canadian Government that it will not hereafter impose any quantitative limitations or fees on Canadian potatoes of the 1948 crop imported into the United States under the system of regulating the movement of potatoes to the United States outlined in the Canadian proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Government of the United States also wishes to inform the Canadian Government with respect to that Government's proposal to guarantee a floor price to certain commercial growers in the Maritime Provinces, that in the opinion of the Treasury Department, the operation of such a proposal as outlined by the Canadian Government would not be considered as a payment or bestowal, directly or indirectly, or any bounty or grant upon the manufacture, production, or export of the potatoes concerned and no countervailing duty would, therefore, be levied, under the provisions of Section 303, Tariff Act of 1930, as a result of such operation of the proposal on potatoes imported from Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Have been informed ACCO [Atlantic Commission Company] representative, Jacksonville, Florida, claiming you have special permission from Department to sell Canadian seed for edible use, if no demand for seed. Please advise basis for claim. Account such disposition is contrary to the intent of U. S. Canadian agreement and to Canadian requirement regarding diversion or reconsignment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January 11, 1949, respondent wired in reply: "Have not made such statement. Only put seed [potatoes] Jacksonville for seed purposes" and, later, on the same day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I realize fully the agreement with Canada, its intent and want to and expect to cooperate with the program. I am only bringing in seed for seed purposes. Canadian dealers are now quoting seed same territory I am selling. Have had quotations as low as 365 hundredweight delivered Norfolk, past week."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  "Less 10,000 Sax Canada No. 1 Seed Potatoes @ $3.65 f. o. b." These 10,000 sacks were immediately resold by the Atlantic Commission Company to respondent. Of them, 8,730 were invoiced by respondent on the same day as "Canada No. 1 Seed Potatoes" in seven lots to four separate dealers in Florida and Georgia, at prices between $3.75 and $4 per cwt. There was no evidence as to the disposition of the remaining 1,270 sacks.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;After serving with the United States Air Force in Korea, Robert W. Toth was honorably discharged. He returned to his home in Pittsburgh and went to work in a steel plant. Five months later he was arrested by military authorities on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder while an airman in Korea.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; At the time of arrest he had no relationship of any kind with the military. He was taken to Korea to stand trial before a court-martial under authority of a 1950 Act of Congress.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; The Court of Appeals, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 28, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/cadc/2cKc/talbott-v-united-states-ex-rel-toth/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;215&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, sustained the Act, rejecting the contention that civilian ex-servicemen like Toth could not constitutionally be subjected to trial by court-martial. We granted certiorari to pass upon this important constitutional question. United States ex rel. Toth v. Talbott, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xiY/united-states-of-america-ex-rel-audrey-m-toth/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;348&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;809&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 75 S.Ct. 39.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p2"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The 1950 Act cannot be sustained on the constitutional power of Congress 'To raise and support Armies', 'To declare War', or to punish 'Offenses against the Law of Nations.' Art. 1, &amp;#167; 8.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; And this assertion of military authority over civilians cannot rest on the President's power as commander-in-chief, or on any theory of martial law. See Ex parte Milligan, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 124&amp;#8212;127, 18 L.Ed. 281. The Government's contention is that the Act is a valid exercise of the power granted Congress in Article I of the Constitution 'To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces', as supplemented by the Necessary and Proper Clause.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="fn5_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p3"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This Court has held that the Article I clause just quoted authorizes Congress to subject persons actually in the armed service to trial by court-martial for military and naval offenses.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6" id="fn6_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; Later it was held that court-martial jurisdiction could be exerted over a dishonorably discharged soldier then a military prisoner serving a sentence imposed by a prior court-martial.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn7" id="fn7_ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; It has never been intimated by this Court, however, that Article I military jurisdiction could be extended to civilian ex-soldiers who had severed all relationship with the military and its institutions.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn8" id="fn8_ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; To allow this extension of military authority would require an extremely broad construction of the language used in the constitutional provision relied on. For given its natural meaning, the power granted Congress 'To make Rules' to regulate 'the land and naval Forces' would seem to restrict court-martial jurisdiction to persons who are actually members or part of the armed forces. There is a compelling reason for construing the clause this way: any expansion of court-martial jurisdiction like that in the 1950 Act necessarily encroaches on the jurisdiction of federal courts set up under Article III of the Constitution where persons on trial are surrounded with more constitutional safeguards than in military tribunals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p4"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Article III provides for the establishment of a court system as one of the separate but coordinate branches of the National Government. It is the primary, indeed the sole business of these courts to try cases and controversies between individuals and between individuals and the Government. This includes trial of criminal cases. These courts are presided over by judges appointed for life, subject only to removal by impeachment. Their compensation cannot be diminished during their continuance in office. The provisions of Article III were designed to give judges maximum freedom from possible coercion or influence by the executive or legislative branches of the Government. But the Constitution and the Amendments in the Bill of Rights show that the Founders were not satisfied with leaving determination of guilt or innocence to judges, even though wholly independent. They further provided that no person should be held to answer in those courts for capital or other infamous crimes unless on the presentment or indictment of a grand jury drawn from the body of the people. Other safeguards designed to protect defendants against oppressive governmental practices were included. One of these was considered so important to liberty of the individual that it appears in two parts of the Constitution. Article III, &amp;#167; 2, commands that the 'Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury * * *.' And the Sixth Amendment provides that 'In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed * * *.' This right of trial by jury ranks very high in our catalogue of constitutional safeguards.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn9" id="fn9_ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p5"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;We find nothing in the history or constitutional treatment of military tribunals which entitles them to rank along with Article III courts as adjudicators of the guilt or innocence of people charged with offenses for which they can be deprived of their life, liberty or property. Unlike courts, it is the primary business of armies and navies to fight or be ready to fight wars should the occasion arise. But trial of soldiers to maintain discipline is merely incidental to an army's primary fighting function. To the extent that those responsible for performance of this primary function are diverted from it by the necessity of trying cases, the basic fighting purpose of armies is not served. And conceding to military personnel that high degree of honesty and sense of justice which nearly all of them undoubtedly have, it still remains true that military tribunals have not been and probably never can be constituted in such way that they can have the same kind of qualifications that the Constitution has deemed essential to fair trials of civilians in federal courts. For instance, the Constitution does not provide life tenure for those performing judicial functions in military trials. They are appointed by military commanders and may be removed at will. Nor does the Constitution protect their salaries as it does judicial salaries. Strides have been made toward making courts-martial less subject to the will of the executive department which appoints, supervises and ultimately controls them. But from the very nature of things, courts have more independence in passing on the life and liberty of people than do military tribunals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p6"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Moreover, there is a great difference between trial by jury and trial by selected members of the military forces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p7"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It is true that military personnel because of their training and experience may be especially competent to try soldiers for infractions of military rules. Such training is no doubt particularly important where an offense charged against a soldier is purely military, such as disobedience of an order, leaving post, etc. But whether right or wrong, the premise underlying the constitutional method for determining guilt or innocence in federal courts is that laymen are better than specialists to perform this task. This idea is inherent in the institution of trial by jury.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p8"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Juries fairly chosen from different walks of life bring into the jury box a variety of different experiences, feelings, intuitions and habits.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn10" id="fn10_ref"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; Such juries may reach completely different conclusions than would be reached by specialists in any single field, including specialists in the military field.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn11" id="fn11_ref"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt; On many occasions, fully known to the Founders of this country, jurors&amp;#8212;plain people&amp;#8212;have manfully stood up in defense of liberty against the importunities of judges and despite prevailing hysteria and prejudices.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn12" id="fn12_ref"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt; The acquittal of William Penn is an illustrious example.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn13" id="fn13_ref"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; Unfortunately, instances could also be cited where jurors have themselves betrayed the cause of justice by verdicts based on prejudice or pressures. In such circumstances independent trial judges and independent appellate judges have a most important place under our constitutional plan since they have power to set aside convictions.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn14" id="fn14_ref"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p9"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The 1950 Act here considered deprives of jury trial and sweeps under military jurisdiction over 3,000,000 persons who have become veterans since the Act became effective. That number is bound to grow from year to year; there are now more than 3,000,000 men and women in uniform.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn15" id="fn15_ref"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt; These figures point up what would be the enormous scope of a holding that Congress could subject every ex-serviceman and woman in the land to trial by court-martial for any alleged offense committed while he or she had been a member of the armed forces. Every veteran discharged since passage of the 1950 Act is subject to military trial for any offense punishable by as much as five years' imprisonment unless the offense is now punishable in a civilian court. And one need only glance at the Military Code to see what a vast number and variety of offenses are thus brought under military jurisdiction.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn16" id="fn16_ref"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt; Included within these are crimes such as murder, conspiracy, absence without leave, contempt toward officials, disrespect toward superior officers, willful or neglectful loss, damage, or destruction of government property, making false official statements, dueling, breach of the peace, forgery, fraud, assault, and many others.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn17" id="fn17_ref"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt; It is true that with reference to some of these offenses, very minor ones, veterans cannot now be tried because of a presidential order fixing the punishment for such offenses at less than five years.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn18" id="fn18_ref"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt; But that amelioration of the Military Code may be temporary, since punishment can be raised or lowered at the will of the President. It is also true that under the present law courts-martial have jurisdiction only if no civilian court does. But that might also be changed by Congress. Thus there is no justification for treating the Act as a mere minor increase of congressional power to expand military jurisdiction. It is a great change, both actually and potentially.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p10"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Fear has been expressed that if this law is not sustained discharged soldiers may escape punishment altogether for crimes they commit while in the service. But that fear is not warranted and was not shared by the Judge Advocate General of the Army who made a strong statement against passage of the law.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn19" id="fn19_ref"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt; He asked Congress to 'confer jurisdiction upon Federal courts to try any person for an offense denounced by the (military) code if he is no longer subject thereto. This would be consistent with the fifth amendment of the Constitution.' The Judge Advocate General went on to tell Congress that 'If you expressly confer jurisdiction on the Federal courts to try such cases, you preserve the constitutional separation of military and civil courts, you save the military from a lot of unmerited grief, and you provide for a clean, constitutional method for disposing of such cases.' It is conceded that it was wholly within the constitutional power of Congress to follow this suggestion and provide for federal district court trials of discharged soldiers accused of offenses committed while in the armed services. This concession is justified. U.S.Const. Art. III, &amp;#167; 2; and see, e.g., Jones v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/tBe/jones-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;137&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;202&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 211&amp;#8212;212, 11 S.Ct. 80, 83, 34 L.Ed. 691; United States v. Bowman, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/vJS/united-states-v-bowman/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;260&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;94&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 97&amp;#8212;98, 43 S.Ct. 39, 40&amp;#8212;41, 67 L.Ed. 149; Skiriotes v. Florida, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wLC/skiriotes-v-florida/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;313&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;69&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 73&amp;#8212;74, 61 S.Ct. 924, 927&amp;#8212;928, 85 L.Ed. 1193. There can be no valid argument, therefore, that civilian ex-servicemen must be tried by court-martial or not tried at all. If that is so it is only because Congress has not seen fit to subject them to trial in federal district courts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p11"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;None of the other reasons suggested by the Government are sufficient to justify a broad construction of the constitutional grant of power to Congress to regulate the armed forces. That provision itself does not empower Congress to deprive people of trials under Bill of Rights safeguards, and we are not willing to hold that power to circumvent those safeguards should be inferred through the Necessary and Proper Clause. It is impossible to think that the discipline of the Army is going to be disrupted, its morale impaired, or its orderly processes disturbed, by giving exservicemen the benefit of a civilian court trial when they are actually civilians. And we are not impressed by the fact that some other countries which do not have our Bill of Rights indulge in the practice of subjecting civilians who were once soldiers to trials by courts-martial instead of trials by civilian courts.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn20" id="fn20_ref"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p12"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;There are dangers lurking in military trials which were sought to be avoided by the Bill of Rights and Article III of our Constitution. Free countries of the world have tried to restrict military tribunals to the narrowest jurisdiction deemed absolutely essential to maintaining discipline among troops in active service. Even as late as the Seventeenth Century standing armies and courts-martial were not established institutions in England.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn21" id="fn21_ref"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt; Court-martial jurisdiction sprang from the belief that within the military ranks there is need for a prompt, ready-at-hand means of compelling obedience and order. But Army discipline will not be improved by court-martialing rather than trying by jury some civilian ex-soldier who has been wholly separated from the service for months, years or perhaps decades. Consequently considerations of discipline provide no excuse for new expansion of court-martial jurisdiction at the expense of the normal and constitutionally preferable system of trial by jury.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn22" id="fn22_ref"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p13"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Determining the scope of the constitutional power of Congress to authorize trial by court-martial presents another instance calling for limitation to 'the least possible power adequate to the end proposed.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn23" id="fn23_ref"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt; We hold that Congress cannot subject civilians like Toth to trial by court-martial. They, like other civilians, are entitled to have the benefit of safeguards afforded those tried in the regular courts authorized by Article III of the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p14"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p15"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Justice REED, with whom Mr. Justice BURTON and Mr. Justice MINTON join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p16"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This case presents the question whether or not an honorably discharged exserviceman may be apprehended by military authorities to stand trial by court-martial for a crime alleged to have been committed by him while he was a member of the armed forces of the United States. The answer turns upon the constitutionality and construction of the applicable provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 64 Stat. 108, 50 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 551 et seq., 50 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 551 et seq. under which the United States Air Force acted in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p17"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Whenever an enactment of Congress to cure weaknesses in criminal procedure is declared unconstitutional by this Court on the ground of lack of legislative power, the door is closed for all practical purposes forever on the method that Congress deems effective for correcting crime. Only an overruling of this case can change today's constitutional determination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p18"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The judgment just announced turns loose, without trial or possibility of trial, a man accused of murder. In future similar cases among the military, if Congress enacts the substitute law as the Court suggests, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;350&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 76 S.Ct. 7, the accused must face a jury far removed from the scene of the alleged crime and before jurors without the understanding of the quality and character of a military crime possessed by those accustomed to administer the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Or perhaps those accused will be extradited and tried by foreign law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p19"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;A dissent is justified, I think, if its argument may limit, in some degree, further interpreting limitations by the judiciary on the power granted by the Constitution to Congress: 'To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces' without the jury and venue requirements of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. These requirements are appropriate for civil trials but, by custom, our precedents and express language are inapplicable to 'cases arising in the land or naval forces.'&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Robert W. Toth, after service in the United States Air Force, was honorably discharged on December 8, 1952. On April 8, 1953, formal charges were signed under the procedures required by the Uniform Code of Military Justice charging Toth with premeditated murder and conspiracy to commit murder.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1-1" id="fn1-1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; The specifications under the charges alleged that the offenses were committed by Toth while an Airman First Class, United States Air Force, on September 27, 1952, at an air base in Korea, and the victim was a named Korean national. It was further alleged that Toth was a civilian subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice under Article 3(a) thereof which provides:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p21"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Subject to the provisions of article 43, any person charged      with having committed, while in a status in which he was      subject to this code, an offense against this code,      punishable by confinement of five years or more and for which      the person cannot be tried in the courts of the United States      or any State or Territory thereof or of the District of      Columbia, shall not be relieved from amenability to trial by      courts-martial by reason of the termination of said status.'      64 Stat. 109, 50 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 553(a), 50 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 553(a).&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2-1" id="fn2-1_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;On May 13, 1953, pursuant to orders originally issued by the Acting Secretary of the Air Force on April 30, 1953, and further supplemental orders through appropriate Air Force command channels, Toth was apprehended by Air Force police at his place of employment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. On May 15, 1953, he was flown to Korea where he arrived on May 18, 1953.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p23"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This was the situation when the petition for habeas corpus was filed by the relator. The Government did not question jurisdiction in the District Court and after argument that court ordered the writ to issue.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3-1" id="fn3-1_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; Toth was returned to the United States and produced in court, whereupon the District Court ordered his discharge on the ground that even if the Air Force police had authority to apprehend Toth, they had no legal power to transport him to a distant point for trial or at least to do so without a hearing. The court therefore found it unnecessary to pass on the constitutional objections raised by the petitioner as to the invalidity of Article 3(a). Toth v. Talbott, D.C., 114 F.Supp. 468.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the District Court, discharged the writ and ordered Toth returned to the military authorities. Talbott v. United States ex rel. Toth, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 28, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/cadc/2cKc/talbott-v-united-states-ex-rel-toth/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;215&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The Court of Appeals held that Article 3(a) of the Code was constitutionally valid and that the Code provided the necessary authorization and machinery to apprehend and transport for trial, in the manner here followed, persons in civilian status who were amenable to courtsmartial by reason of the provisions of Article 3(a).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p25"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Code was enacted May 5, 1950, after careful military and congressional study to assure that the military justice of the unified services would be in accordance with the present-day standards of fairness.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4-1" id="fn4-1_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; Article 3(a) was adopted in view of the decision of this Court in United States ex rel. Hirshberg v. Cooke, 1949, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x72/united-states-ex-rel-hirshberg-v-cooke/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;336&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;210&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 69 S.Ct. 530, 93 L.Ed. 621, holding the Articles for the Government of the Navy, then in force, did not allow trial on charges filed subsequent to honorable discharge 'without a grant of congressional authority,' id., 336 U.S. at page 215, 69 S.Ct. at page 533, although the charges arose from acts committed while the defendant was in military service. The near escape from military justice of Army personnel accused of the theft in Germany of the Hesse crown jewels was also in mind.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5-1" id="fn5-1_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; It was thought that a serviceman's discharge should not bar his prosecution in a military court for crimes committed when subject to military discipline.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6-1" id="fn6-1_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p26"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The enactment of Article 3(a) was chosen instead of the alternative of federal district court jurisdiction, although thorough presentations of objections not only on constitutional but also on policy grounds appear in the committee report and the Congressional Record.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn7-1" id="fn7-1_ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; The military were well aware, as was Congress, of possible unfavorable public reaction to extension of the jurisdiction of military courts to discharged veterans for alleged misdeeds during service. The language of Article 3(a) was drawn to cover only the most serious offenses and restricted to those instances in which the guilty would otherwise escape trial or punishment in any American courts. Although Congress, under Art. I, &amp;#167; 8, cl. 14,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn8-1" id="fn8-1_ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; and the Necessary and Proper Clause, doubtless might have authorized the civil courts to try charges arising from violations of the Military Code during former service, even though committed on foreign soil,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn9-1" id="fn9-1_ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt; it chose the method of Article 3(a).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p27"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;No question of accommodating the liberty of the citizen to requirements of the military through the interpretation of an ambiguous Act arises. Compare Ex parte Endo, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wVR/ex-parte-endo/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;323&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;283&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 300, 65 S.Ct. 208, 217, 89 L.Ed. 243. It is not for courts to question the wisdom of the legislation. Its obvious purpose was to assure, insofar as discipline may do so, the proper conduct of our far-flung and numerous military personnel in foreign lands. One need not stress the necessity of orderly conduct by the military on foreign posts for the maintenance of good relations in friendly or vanquished countries. It also seems a reasonable choice that uniform treatment by courts-martial trial of all accused of crimes punishable by the Military Code is preferred for morale and disciplinary purposes to courts-martial trial only for those who remain in the service. This case itself would make a good example of the difficulty of a federal district court trial. We address ourselves to the constitutionality of Article 3(a).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p28"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;(a) The congressional power under Article I of the Constitution to regulate the armed forces is conceded by the Court to embrace the power to provide for trial by court-martial and military punishment for violations of the Military Code. But the Court holds that that power ceases when the serviceman becomes a civilian. Nothing, we think, in the words of Article I or in the history of that congressional power justifies limiting trial and punishment by the military, for crimes committed by members of the armed services, to the period of service. Certainly the power of Congress to provide for a military trial and punishment for a breach of the Military Code on charges brought before the end of enlistment or discharge may continue thereafter.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn10-1" id="fn10-1_ref"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; The crime charged against Toth was one covered by the Code. The circumstance that he was discharged from the service prior to the detection of the alleged crime and prior to being charged with its commission should make no constitutional difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p29"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Courts-martial are deeply rooted in history. War is a grim business, requiring sacrifice of ease, opportunity, freedom from restraint, and liberty of action. Experience has demonstrated that the law of the military must be capable of prompt punishment to maintain discipline. The power to regulate the armed forces must have been granted to Congress so that it would have the authority over its armed forces that other nations have long exercised, subject only to limitations of the Constitution. Dynes v. Hoover, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/rUe/dynes-v-hoover/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;How.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;65&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 78&amp;#8212;79, 15 L.Ed. 838; Ex parte Reed, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/sKQ/ex-parte-reed/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 21, 25 L.Ed. 538. The Government calls our attention to the current provisions for military trial after discharge of other nations with legal background similar to ours. Each of them allows such trials under varying conditions.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn11-1" id="fn11-1_ref"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt; Whether English courts-martial before 1789 exercised jurisdiction over charges preferred after separation from service cannot be categorically asserted in view of the paucity of cases. It would seem, however, that the language of Article I itself properly should be interpreted to empower Congress to authorize courts-martial after separation from the services. The crime charged was committed during service and violated the Military Code. Surely when read with the Necessary and Proper Clause, the conclusion must follow. Article 3(a) bears a reasonable relation to the 'Government and Regulation' of the armed forces; it is appropriate and plainly adapted to that end. McCulloch v. Maryland, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/7LyH/mcculloch-v-maryland/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wheat.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;316&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 419 et seq., 4 L.Ed. 579. That has been the test of congressional power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p30"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This is not an effort to make a civilian subject to military law, in distinction to martial law, as in Ex parte Milligan, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 121, 123, 127, 18 L.Ed. 281. Such an effort would meet condemnation as an invasion of the liberty of the citizen. See Duncan v. Kahanamoku, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wZm/duncan-v-kahanamoku/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;327&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;304&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 66 S.Ct. 606, 90 L.Ed. 688; Ex parte Endo, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wVR/ex-parte-endo/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;323&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;283&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 65 S.Ct. 208, 89 L.Ed. 243. Congress was granted authority to regulate the armed forces in order to enforce obedience by members of the military establishment to military regulation during their service to the end that order may be ensured. Disobedience may occur in nationally critical times. What reason can there be for refusing courts-martial jurisdiction over crimes so committed by a serviceman merely because they passed undiscovered during the service period?&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn12-1" id="fn12-1_ref"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt; Could there now be doubt as to the power of Congress under Art. I to make a draftee subject to courts-martial before actual induction into the armed forces? This Court had none in 1944. Then we said, when considering a habeas corpus for release from military imprisonment after trial by court-martial of a person claiming civilian status:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p31"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'We have no doubt of the power of Congress to enlist the      manpower of the nation for prosecution of the war and to      subject to military jurisdiction those who are unwilling, as      well as those who are eager, to come to the defense of their      nation in its hour of peril.

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Judicial history lends its weight to the conclusion that congressional power to institute criminal proceedings against a military person continues after the accused's discharge. In 1863, the Congress enacted an Act to prevent and punish frauds upon the Government of the United States. It provided that any person in the military forces shall be punished for fraud under military regulation 'as the court-martial may adjudge, save the punishment of death.' 12 Stat. 696&amp;#8212;697, &amp;#167; 1. Under &amp;#167; 2, jurisdiction of the court-martial was extended to dischargees.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn13-1" id="fn13-1_ref"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; The provision for charge and court-martial after discharge was ruled constitutional in 1866 by Attorney General Stanbery.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn14-1" id="fn14-1_ref"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt; The section was held constitutional in 1873. In re Bogart, 3 Fed.Cas.No.1,596, p. 796. See other cases, note 22, infra. It was apparently held unconstitutional in 1946 under Article I in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, although the problem under the Fifth Amendment was also considered. United States ex rel. Flannery v. Commanding General, D.C., 69 F.Supp. 661, 664.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn15-1" id="fn15-1_ref"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p34"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It is also to be noted that the present Uniform Code, Art. 4, 50 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 554, 50 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 554, provides that an officer dismissed by the President may request trial by court-martial after such dismissal. A similar provision was first enacted by Congress in 1865, &amp;#167; 12, 13 Stat. 487, 489; see Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents (2d ed., Reprint 1920), 64, 65.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p35"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Court finds a 'compelling reason' for construing the clause for Army regulation more narrowly than has been done by the Congress and the Executive for many years. This is that trial by Article III judges and juries offers safeguards to military offenders superior to those offered by courts-martial. Under our judicial system the use of juries has been found satisfactory in civil life. The argument for the adoption of civil trials for the military might appeal to Congress, if presented there. But, with due respect to the premise of the majority, the assumed superiority of the civil courts in the trial of service crimes should have no force in the construction of the constitutional power of Congress to enact Article 3(a) of the Code. Belief that an accused has better opportunities to escape conviction in a civil court should not influence a conclusion as to constitutional power. As later appears in this opinion, the Fifth and Sixth Amendments except the land and naval forces from their commands. The advantages and disadvantages of indictment, venue and jury trial for the military have been weighed and determined adversely to the Court's conclusion by the Constitution and the Congress. Certainly the number of former members of the armed services now living is immaterial to the constitutional issue, as are the 'dangers' suggested to be 'lurking in military trials.' The military is in position to give its personnel a fair trial. The only logical ground for declaring Article 3(a) unconstitutional is that military crimes cannot be so punished because such procedure is beyond the reach of the congressional authority to make rules for government of military personnel. Subsequent punishment by military procedures will help discipline during service. Such a conclusion by Congress is not strained or unreasonable but a natural use of its power to make regulations for the armed services. The choice is for Congress, not the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p36"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;36&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;(b) Another constitutional problem arises, i.e., that Article 3(a) is unlawful by reason of the limitations on prosecutions of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn16-1" id="fn16-1_ref"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p37"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;37&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The argument upon the Sixth Amendment requires only summary treatment. The rights to a speedy and public trial, impartiality of the triers, information as to the charge, confrontation, compulsory process for witnesses and assistance of counsel are not in issue. This accused will not have for his trial a jury of the State and district of the crime, previously ascertained by our law. That is an impossibility in the circumstances of this case. Nor can it be that the Sixth Amendment requirements as to jury and place were intended to apply to the 'cases arising in the land or naval forces' which were excepted from the protection of the grand jury by the Fifth. That would abrogate the authority of Congress to govern the military by courts-martial. It was so announced by this Court, unanimously, in Ex parte Milligan, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 122, 18 L.Ed. 281.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn17-1" id="fn17-1_ref"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt; Defendants in cases arising in the armed forces, we think, are not entitled to demand trial by jury, whether the crime was committed on foreign soil or at a place within a State or previously ascertained district.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p38"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;38&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Turning to the Fifth Amendment the critical words are obviously 'cases arising in the land or naval forces.' The events leading to the taking of Toth into custody occurred while he was enlisted. They constituted then and now a violation of the Uniform Code. Relator would limit the quoted words to cases where charges had been filed during service. She stresses the phrase 'when in actual service', but this Court has held and all the history of our courts-martial shows that such phrase has reference only to 'cases arising * * * in the Militia.' Johnson v. Sayre, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/u13/johnson-v-sayre/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;158&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;109&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 114, 15 S.Ct. 773, 775, 39 L.Ed. 914.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p39"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;39&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Fifth, like the other early amendments, arose from the determination to protect the rights of citizens. As the Articles of Confederation, Article 9, granted authority to the central government to make rules for the government and regulation of the armed forces, the Nation was conversant with the problem. In the state conventions for ratification of the Constitution, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Rhode Island suggested words for regulation of the armed forces quite similar to the ones adopted by Congress.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn18-1" id="fn18-1_ref"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt; It will be observed that two employ 'arise.' Three speak of 'cases.' Since the state suggestions were made as the result of consideration of the proposed Constitution, it is quite natural that the language of Article III concerning the judicial power would find an echo in the suggestions, Article III, &amp;#167; 2, reads, 'The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority * * *.' When the Congress considered the Act against military fraud in 1863, note 13, supra, no one suggested that a 'case,' the prosecution for which under the Act did not begin until after discharge of a serviceman, would not be a 'case arising in the land or naval forces.' The concern of Congress was with the liability of contractors, as party of military personnel, under &amp;#167; 1 of the Act, when they had no true military service status.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn19-1" id="fn19-1_ref"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt; Because not service-connected, the contractors' clause has been held unconstitutional. Ex parte Henderson, 11 Fed.Cas.No.6,349, pp. 1067, 1071.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p40"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The word 'case,' of course, might refer to litigation&amp;#8212;a charge or complaint brought in court, here a prosecution. But it seems to us that its meaning, as used in the constitutional clauses under consideration, is a state of facts for judicial action, i.e., the series of events that creates an enforceable right or obligation. The context in which it is used bears on the final definition. Here 'cases arising' is more specific than the word 'case' alone. The Government gives us several citations to cases applying the meaning for which it contends.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn20-1" id="fn20-1_ref"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; Relator does the same.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn21-1" id="fn21-1_ref"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt; Article III uses 'cases arising' under federal law to indicate the extent of possible federal jurisdiction over legal rights or duties created by the laws of the United States. The meaning of 'cases arising' in Article III and the Fifth Amendment must be determined by their purpose. That purpose is similar&amp;#8212;to mark the source of the cause of action that ripens into a civil complaint or criminal charge. However restricted the word 'case' may be, its use with 'arising' points to the source of the litigation. If a case is claimed to exist only after institution of legal proceedings, nevertheless that case has its roots, it arises, in the events that give life to the cause of action. When a case so arises was stated thus in Gully v. First Nat. Bank, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wwK/gully-v-first-nat-bank-in-meridian/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;299&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;109&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 112, 57 S.Ct. 96, 97, 81 L.Ed. 70, in an opinion concerning the removal statute, where removal was asked because the state suit was alleged to have arisen under federal law:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'To bring a case within the statute, a right or immunity      created by the Constitution or laws of the United States must      be an element, and an essential one, of the plaintiff's cause      of action. * * * The right or immunity must be such that it      will be supported if the Constitution or laws of the United      States are given one construction or effect, and defeated if      they receive another. * * *'&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;One of the purposes of the Fifth Amendment by this exception was to preserve the separation of military law from the requirements of civil law. The regulation of the armed forces by Congress under cl. 14 of &amp;#167; 8, Art. I, was to be left for legislative judgment that discipline might be maintained by speedy trial and punishment in accordance with military law. The reasons, set out in our discussion of Article I power to regulate the armed forces, need not be repeated here. We ask ourselves, 'What law is the basis of this prosecution?' The answer is the Military Code. If so, the case arises 'in the land or naval forces.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p43"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;43&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;That conclusion has the support of the weight of the precedents dealing with this phase of the Fifth Amendment. To meet the argument of defendant that jurisdiction must attach before discharge, it was said in the Bogart case, 3 Fed.Cas.No. 1,596, pp. 796, 799:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p44"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;44&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Among the ordinary and most common definitions of the word      'arise,' are 'to proceed, to issue, to spring,' and a case      arising in the land or naval forces upon a fair and      reasonable construction of the whole article, appears to us      to be a case proceeding, issuing or springing from acts in      violation of the naval laws and regulations committed while      in the naval forces or service.' This statement has been strengthened by the accord given the argument by other courts.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn22-1" id="fn22-1_ref"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p45"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;45&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;(c) The Court, of course, does not gainsay the constitutional suthority of Congress to adopt a military code for regulation of members of the armed forces without regard to the generally applicable requirements of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. It holds that where the constitutional safeguards of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments for a citizen's freedom from tyranny are at stake, they should not be withdrawn except through absolute necessity. There is no such necessity here for it would have been possible to have provided a proper civil trial with the full protection of the applicable clauses of the Amendments. But here we are considering an exception to the safeguards offered by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. That exception has been written into the Constitution from the experience of history to protect the discipline of the armed forces. Of course, that exception from the protections of these Amendments should be strictly construed to hold those excluded to the minimum as was done in Ex parte Henderson, supra, 76 S.Ct. 17. Construction of the Constitution, however, should not be allowed to emasculate the natural meaning of language designed to protect the Nation in the regulation of its armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p46"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;46&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;What we have argued in the foregoing pages of this opinion supports our conclusion on this tendered rule of construction. Granting that there are possible means of affording civil trials to persons discharged from the Army for military crimes committed during their service, we think that Congress has power to provide for punishment of these military crimes under the constitutional exceptions discussed. Such punishment, if our analysis of Article I and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments is correct, will be for military crimes of servicemen, not of civilians, and for the maintenance of discipline in the armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p47"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;47&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The relator phrases strongly her argument against Toth's prosecution by courts-martial. To her the issue is 'military dictatorship.' Though she concedes that Congress may have merely desired to bar absolution from crime by discharge from service, such purpose, she argues, should not override the Constitution or be allowed to foreshadow a 'military dictatorship.' She forebodes that every petty crime may be included and limitation of prosecution be extended until all discharged servicemen shall live their lives under fear of the Military. The law still has degrees of harshness and courts and legislatures must act in reason. The possibility of individual abuse of power is ever present even under our Constitution but the probability of obliteration of any such tendency through judicial, executive or legislative action is the citizen's protection under the Constitution. A fear that punishment by courts-martial of servicemen after discharge may bear a threat to the rights and security of citizens is extravagant. It is true today, as it was in the time of the Founding Fathers, that the methods for maintenance of Army discipline should be subject to public opinion as expressed through Congress. If trial of discharged servicemen by courts-martial under the carefully defined provisions of Article 3(a) seems harsh or hurtful to liberty, the door of Congress remains open for amelioration. This decision that a veteran, let out of the military forces before charges, must, by the Constitution, be tried by the civil courts for his military crimes impairs congressional power. Now only another Constitutional Amendment or a reversal of today's judgment will enable Congress to deal consistently with those violating the Uniform Code of Military Justice. We cannot agree that those who adopted the constitutional provisions for the protection of military discipline intended such a result. Toth's alleged accomplices have been convicted by military courts and we see no reason why he should not be tried as proposed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p48"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;48&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The decision below should be affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;I agree with the opinion of Mr. Justice REED, and I would add another reason why I think the judgment should be affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;A civilian not under the jurisdiction of the Military Code has a right to be tried in a civil court for an alleged crime as a civilian. My trouble is that I don't think Toth was a full-fledged civilian. By 50 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 553, 50 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 553, Congress had retained jurisdiction to try Toth for a crime he had committed while a soldier and for which admittedly he could have been tried by court-martial if the United States had discovered his crime one minute before discharge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p52"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;52&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;He was not a full-fledged civilian under his discharge. He was still a soldier to answer in court-martial for the crime he had committed while a soldier. He had a conditional discharge only. The United States clearly reserved the right to charge and try him by court-martial for a crime committed while in the status of a soldier. This is the way Congress had provided for his trial. No other way was provided. That it may have provided another way is not to say the way provided is invalid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p53"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;I know of no reason why Congress could not pass this statute, 50 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 553, 50 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 553, retaining court-martial jurisdiction over Toth to answer for a crime he allegedly committed when he was clearly subject to court-martial. Kahn v. Anderson, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/vD3/kahn-v-anderson/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 41 S.Ct. 224, 65 L.Ed. 469, holds that, even though discharged from service, one convicted and serving sentence for a military offense could still be tried by courtmartial for murder, and conspiracy to commit murder even though the crime was alleged to have been committed within the limits of a state. Congress had made no provision for retention of status in that case as it had in this case, yet the Court implied the continuing military status to warrant the jurisdiction. No implied status is necessary here. It is expressly reserved by statute. Toth remained in that status by virtue of the statute.&lt;/p&gt;

The Declaration of Independence stated as one of the grievances of the colonies that the King of Great Britain had deprived the colonists of the benefits of trial by jury in many cases and that he had 'affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.'

The jurors, and they alone, are to judge of the facts, and weigh the evidence. The law has established this tribunal because it is believed that, from its numbers, the mode of their selection, and the fact that the jurors come from all casses of society, they are better calculated to judge of motives, weigh probabilities, and take what may be called a common sense view of a set of circumstances, involving both act and intent, than any single man, however pure, wise and eminent he may be. This is the theory of the law; and as applied to criminal accusations, it is eminently wise, and favorable alike to liberty and to justice.' People v.

Schiedt, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wqN/dimick-v-schiedt/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;293&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;474&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 485&amp;#8212;486, 55 S.Ct. 296, 300&amp;#8212;301, 79 L.Ed. 603, said, 'The right of trial by jury is of ancient origin, characterized by Blackstone as 'the glory of the English law' and 'the most transcendent privilege which any subject can enjoy' (Bk. 3, p. 379); and, as Justice Story said (2 Story on the Constitution, &amp;#167; 1779), '* * * the Constitution would have been justly obnoxious to the most conclusive objection if it had not recognized and confirmed it in the most solemn terms.' With, perhaps, some exceptions, trial by jury has always been, and still is, generally regarded as the normal and preferable mode of disposing of issues of fact in civil cases at law as well as in criminal cases. Maintenance of the jury as a fact-finding body is of such importance and occupies so firm a place in our history and jurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the right to a jury trial should be scrutinized with the utmost care. Compare Patton v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wc1/patton-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;281&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;276&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 312, 50 S.Ct. 253 (263), 74 L.Ed. 854.'&lt;/p&gt;

Both reports contain the following sentence: 'In the opinion of the committee, the present provisions (Article 3(a)) of this subdivision provide a desirable degree of continuing jurisdiction and at the same time place sufficient limitations on the continuing jurisdiction to prevent capricious actions on the part of military authorities.'

        &lt;p&gt;'(I) Where an offence under this Act has been committed by any person while subject to military law, such person may be taken into and kept in military custody, and tried and punished for such offence, although he, or the corps or battalion to which he belongs, has ceased to be subject to military law in like manner as he might have been&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;taken into and kept in military custody, tried or punished, if he or such corps or battalion had continued so subject:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Provided that where a person has since the commission of an offence ceased to be subject to military law, he shall not be tried for such offence, except in the case of the offence of mutiny, desertion, or fraudulent enlistment, unless his trial commences within three months after he had ceased to be subject to military law, or unless the offence was committed outside the United Kingdom and is an offence which when committed in England is punishable by the law of England, and the Attorney-General consents to the trial * * *.'&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The British Army Act, including the provision in &amp;#167; 158 for court-martial after termination of military service, dates from 1881. 17 Law Reports (Statutes) 44 and 45 Vict. 260, 331.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;See also the Defence Act of Australia, &amp;#167; 103(3), Commonwealth Acts, vol. II (1901&amp;#8212;1950), 1560, 1596; National Defence Act of Canada, 1950, &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 56(2) and (3), and 68(f), Revised Statutes of Canada, 1952, Vol. III, 3814 and 3821. New Zealand has a similar statute (Army Act, &amp;#167; 127(1), New Zealand Statutes, 1950, 283, 370 371).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;At the time of our Constitutional Convention, there had already been held the well-known court-martial of Lord George Sackville for disobedience of orders of his Chief, Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, at the battle of Minden. The trial took place after his dismissal from his command and the service. The King, George II, submitted the question of jurisdiction of the court-martial to the twelve judges composing the Courts of King's Bench, Common Pleas and Exchequer, headed by Lord Mansfield, and received the following advisory answer:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'In obedience to your Majesty's commands, signified to us by a letter * * *, referring to us the following question, 'Whether an officer of the army having been dismissed from his Majesty's service, and having no military employment, is triable by a Court Martial for a military offence lately committed by him while in actual service and pay as an officer?'&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'We have taken the same into consideration, and see no ground to doubt of the legality of the jurisdiction of a Court Martial in the case put by the above question.'&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The judges ended with a reservation of the privilege of changing their minds if the matter were judicially presented, apparently in accordance with the practice in such advisory opinions. See note, 28 Eng.Rep. 941. II Eden's Chancery Reports, App., p. 371. See Trials, Courts Martial&amp;#8212;Sackville, 1760. On conviction the King directed the sentence be recorded in the order book of every regiment, British and American. In view of the prominence of the parties and the subsequent distinguished career of Lord George Sackville, who died in 1785 after having been advanced in 1782 to the peerage as Viscount Sackville for his services in Parliament, the Irish Administration, and as Secretary of State for the Colonies, the case could hardly have escaped the notice of the members of the Constitutional Convention. See VII Dictionary of Nat. Biography 1110; 4 Smollett, History of England, 337; Tytler, Military Law (2d ed.), 113. 8 Op.Attys.Gen. 328.

        &lt;p&gt; It must be noted, however, that a leading military authority is against that view. See Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents (2d ed., Reprint 1920), 105, although he admits the weight of the precedents is against him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;See, however, a comparable authority, Edmund M. Morgan, Court Martial Jurisdiction, 4 Minn.Law Rev. 79, 83 (1920). For further discussion of the problem, see Myers and Kaplan, Crime Without Punishment, 35 Geo.L.J. 303 (1947); Note, Military Jurisdiction over Discharged Servicemen: Constitutionality and Judicial Protection, 67 Harv.L.Rev. 479 (1954); Note, The Amenability of the Veteran to Military Law, 46 Col.L.Rev. 977 (1946).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; 'That any person heretofore called or hereafter to be called into or employed in such forces or service, who shall commit any violation of this act and shall afterwards receive his discharge, or be dismissed from the service, shall, notwithstanding such discharge or dismissal, continue to be liable to be arrested and held for trial and sentence by a court-martial, in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had not received such discharge or been dismissed.'&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This was carried into the Articles of War. Rev.Stat. (1878) Art. 60, p. 235, 10 U.S.C. (1946 Ed.) &amp;#167; 1566, Art. 94, 10 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 1566, amended 62 Stat. 641, and in the Articles for the Government of the Navy, 34 U.S.C.

        &lt;p&gt;In 1848 Attorney General Toucey, in the absence of any applicable rule for the government of the Army, had ruled that a charge of murder could not be brought against an officer already mustered out. 5 Op.Attys.Gen. 55, 58.

        &lt;p&gt; Fifth Amendment: 'No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.'&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sixth Amendment: 'In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining Witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.'&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; 'Another guarantee of freedom was broken when Milligan was denied a trial by jury. The great minds of the country have differed on the correct interpretation to be given to various provisions of the Federal Constitution; and judicial decision has been often invoked to settle their true meaning; but until recently no one ever doubted that the right of trial by jury was fortified in the organic law against the power of attack. It is now assailed; but if ideas can be expressed in words, and language has any meaning, this right&amp;#8212;one of the most valuable in a free country&amp;#8212;is preserved to every one accused of crime who is not attached to the army, or navy, or militia in actual service. The sixth amendment affirms that 'in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury,' language broad enough to embrace all persons and cases; but the fifth, recognizing the necessity of an indictment, or presentment, before any one can be held to answer for high crimes, 'excepts cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service, in time of war or public danger;' and the framers of the Constitution, doubtless, meant to limit the right of trial by jury, in the sixth amendment, to those persons who were subject to indictment or presentment in the fifth.'&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The four who concurred agreed with the majority on this point:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'The Constitution itself provides for military government as well as for civil government. And we do not understand it to be claimed that the civil safeguards of the Constitution have application in cases within the proper sphere of the former.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'What, then, is that proper sphere? Congress has power to raise and support armies; to provide and maintain a navy; to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces; and to provide for governing such part of the militia as may be in the service of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'It is not denied that the power to make rules for the government of the army and navy is a power to provide for trial and punishment by military courts without a jury. It has been so understood and exercised from the adoption of the Constitution to the present time.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Nor, in our judgment, does the fifth, or any other amendment, abridge that power. 'Cases arising in the land and naval forces, or in the militia in actual service in time of war or public danger,' are expressly excepted from the fifth amendment, 'that no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury,' and it is admitted that the exception applies to the other amendments as well as to the fifth.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'We think, therefore, that the power of Congress, in the government of the land and naval forces and of the militia, is not at all affected by the fifth or any other amendment.' 4 Wall., at pages 137&amp;#8212;138.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It was so held as to Haupt, treated as an American citizen in Ex parte Quirin, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/6zny/ex-parte-quirin/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;317&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 20, 24, 40, 44, 63 S.Ct. 2, 7, 9, 16 -19, 87 L.Ed. 3.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'We conclude that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments did not restrict whatever authority was conferred by the Constitution to try offenses against the law of war by military commission, and that petitioners, charged with such an offense not required to be tried by jury at common law, were lawfully placed on trial by the Commission without a jury.' Id., 317 U.S. at page 45, 63 S.Ct. at page 19.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;'The question arises, what is a 'case arising in the land or naval forces of the United States?' There is not any doubt that a soldier or officer who has enlisted in the service of the United States is or may be made subject to martial law. Why is he made subject to martial law? Because, being in the service of the United States, the act committed by him is a case arising in that service. * * * An officer or soldier enters the Army under contract, under an agreement to render this service; and how, I beg to inquire, does the case of a contractor who engages to furnish arms, equipments, or munitions of war to the United States for the same purpose, differ from the case of an officer or soldier who is simply to bear arms and use the materials which the contractor is to furnish?'

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued February 11, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided February 28, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Raymond H. Kierr&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Samuel C. Gainsburgh.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Andrew R. Martinez&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Jos. M. Rault&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;William E. Wright.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;John J. Burns&lt;/i&gt; filed a brief for the American Merchant Marine Institute, Inc., as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae,&lt;/i&gt; urging affirmance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a suit by an American seaman against the owner and operator of an ocean freighter, the &lt;i&gt;Mason Lykes,&lt;/i&gt; on which he was formerly employed. He based his claim for recovery both on negligence and on breach of the warranty of seaworthiness. The case was tried by the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*337&lt;/span&gt; court upon waiver of jury. The District Court found for the plaintiff, holding that the shipowner breached its warranty of seaworthiness and that its officers were negligent. 112 F. Supp. 177. The Court of Appeals reversed, 211 F. 2d 618. We granted certiorari to resolve a seeming conflict between that opinion and &lt;i&gt;Keen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Overseas Tankship Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 194 F. 2d 515, decided by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 348 U. S. 814.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiff was employed in the engine department as an oiler. The ship had a deck maintenance man, named Manuel Gonzales. Plaintiff's injury was inflicted by Gonzales, who, during the course of a night's drinking party, went to plaintiff's room and took a bottle of brandy from under plaintiff's bed. Plaintiff awoke, startled; and Gonzales attacked him with the bottle, causing severe injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Court placed liability for breach of the warranty of seaworthiness on the holding of the &lt;i&gt;Keen&lt;/i&gt; case, where Judge Learned Hand wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The warranty of seaworthiness as to hull and gear has never meant that the ship shall withstand every violence of wind and weather; all it means is that she shall be reasonably fit for the voyage in question. Applied to a seaman, such a warranty is, not that the seaman is competent to meet all contingencies; but that he is equal in disposition and seamanship to the ordinary men in the calling." 194 F. 2d, at 518.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Court found that Gonzales was not "equal in disposition and seamanship to the ordinary men in the calling." 112 F. Supp., at 180.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assault by Gonzales on plaintiff occurred in the early morning of November 25, 1949. This happened during the course of a drinking party on board in which much liquor was consumed, Gonzales drinking nearly a fifth. Gonzales was, indeed, drunk when he assaulted plaintiff. The evidence is disputed; but the District &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*338&lt;/span&gt; Court found that shortly after Gonzales struck plaintiff with the bottle, he returned with a large knife which he also intended to use on him. When plaintiff was taken to the ship's hospital, Gonzales created a disturbance outside &#151;threatening the mate, trying to enter the sick bay, and offering to give blood to plaintiff for a transfusion. Those events followed on the heels of the assault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About six hours after the assault, Gonzales was ordered to the master's cabin, where he refused to make any statement about the assault. Later he was ordered to clean the ship's hospital. Instead of doing that, he left the ship against orders. Early in the afternoon, Gonzales returned to the ship with bottles of liquor, at which time the captain apprehended him, took the bottles away, and placed him in irons&#151;a step which the captain testified he seldom used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, November 26, Gonzales left the vessel without leave and did not return until the morning of November 28, when he was logged for disobedience of orders and fined for being absent without leave. On return of the &lt;i&gt;Mason Lykes&lt;/i&gt; to the United States, Gonzales was discharged by the captain, though, since that time, he has served on respondent's vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the basis of these facts, the District Court found that Gonzales was "a person of dangerous propensities and proclivities" at the time of his assault on plaintiff; that Gonzales was "a person of violent character, belligerent disposition, excessive drinking habits, disposed to fighting and making threats and assaults." 112 F. Supp., at 179.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think the record does not warrant rejection of the District Court's findings and that the findings warrant recovery for breach of the warranty of seaworthiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warranty of seaworthiness is a species of liability without fault. &lt;i&gt;The Osceola,&lt;/i&gt; 189 U. S. 158; &lt;i&gt;Seas Shipping Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sieracki,&lt;/i&gt; 328 U. S. 85, 90-94. Yet it does not &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*339&lt;/span&gt; mean that the shipowner is liable for injuries "resulting from every sailors' brawl," as Judge Learned Hand put it in &lt;i&gt;Jones&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lykes Bros. Steamship Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 204 F. 2d 815, 816. It does not mean that the owner is liable every time a seaman gets drunk and does damage to a member of the crew. It does not mean that the owner is liable for injuries from all the fisticuffs on shipboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"All men are to some degree irascible; every workman is apt to be angry when a fellow complains of his work to their common superior; and some will harbor their resentment and provoke a quarrel over it even after the lapse of several hours. Sailors lead a rough life and are more apt to use their fists than office employees; what will seem to sedentary and protected persons an insufficient provocation for a personal encounter, is not the measure of the `disposition' of `the ordinary men in the calling.' " &lt;i&gt;Jones&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 817.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warranty of seaworthiness does not mean that the ship can weather all storms. It merely means that "the vessel is reasonably fit to carry the cargo." &lt;i&gt;The Silvia,&lt;/i&gt; 171 U. S. 462, 464; &lt;i&gt;The Southwark,&lt;/i&gt; 191 U. S. 1, 9. If it is not, the owner is liable, irrespective of any fault on his part. &lt;i&gt;The Osceola, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seas Shipping Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sieracki, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see no reason to draw a line between the ship and the gear on the one hand and the ship's personnel on the other.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; A seaman with a proclivity for assaulting people &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*340&lt;/span&gt; may, indeed, be a more deadly risk than a rope with a weak strand or a hull with a latent defect. The problem, as with many aspects of the law, is one of degree. Was the assault within the usual and customary standards of the calling? Or is it a case of a seaman with a wicked disposition, a propensity to evil conduct, a savage and vicious nature? If it is the former, it is one of the risks of the sea that every crew takes. If the seaman has a savage and vicious nature, then the ship becomes a perilous place. A vessel bursting at the seams might well be a safer place than one with a homicidal maniac as a crew member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not intimate that Gonzales is a maniac nor that that extreme need be reached before liability for unseaworthiness arises. We do think that there was sufficient evidence to justify the District Court in holding that Gonzales had crossed the line, that he had such savage disposition as to endanger the others who worked on the ship. We think the District Court was justified in concluding that Gonzales was not equal in disposition to the ordinary men of that calling and that the crew with Gonzales as a member was not competent to meet the contingencies of the voyage. We conclude that there was evidence to support the cause of action for breach of the warranty of seaworthiness. Therefore we do not reach the question of negligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE REED concurs in the result on the ground of the negligence of the ship's officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]  Situations involving breach of warranty of seaworthiness by reason of the disposition of a crew member have been presented in several recent decisions. Recovery was allowed in &lt;i&gt;Thompson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Coastal Oil Co.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/njd/c1qr/thompson-v-coastal-oil-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;119&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;838&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (D. C. N. J.), rev'd on other grounds, 221 F. 2d 559. The court followed the &lt;i&gt;Keen&lt;/i&gt; case in holding that a crewman who tried to murder one of his fellows with a meat cleaver was not equal in disposition to those of his calling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Stankiewicz&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United Fruit Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;123&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;714&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (S. D. N. Y.), the court directed a verdict for defendant on a cause of action for breach of warranty of seaworthiness, on the ground that there was no evidence that the assailant was not equal in disposition to men of his calling. As noted, the same result followed in the &lt;i&gt;Jones&lt;/i&gt; case, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; where the court held the test of unseaworthiness had not been met where a crewman assaulted one of his fellows following an earlier argument. And see &lt;i&gt;Kelcey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tankers Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 217 F. 2d 541.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided March 7, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sam Dazzo&lt;/i&gt; for petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Beatrice Rosenberg&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Joseph A. Barry&lt;/i&gt; for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PER CURIAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petition for writ of certiorari is granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that the judgment of the Court of Appeals of October 20, 1954, reversing and remanding this cause with instructions to dismiss the indictment was correct. It is not necessary for us to pass on the question presented under its subsequent judgment of November 17, 1954, directing a new trial. We vacate the latter judgment, which directed the new trial, and we reinstate the former one which instructed the trial court to dismiss the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner was convicted by the jury of a conspiracy to defraud the United States. Petitioner moved for a judgment of acquittal. The District Court denied the motion. On appeal, the Court of Appeals held that that motion should have been granted, as the evidence &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*374&lt;/span&gt; was insufficient to convict. 216 F. 2d 722. It accordingly reversed and remanded the cause with instructions to dismiss the indictment. Later, the Government moved to amend the judgment so as to grant a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. The Court of Appeals granted the motion of the Government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The granting of a new trial after a judgment of acquittal for lack of evidence violated the command of the Fifth Amendment that no person shall "be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correct rule was stated in &lt;i&gt;Kepner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 195 U. S. 100, at 130, "It is, then, the settled law of this court that former jeopardy includes one who has been acquitted by a verdict duly rendered . . . ." If the jury had acquitted, there plainly would be double jeopardy to give the Government another go at this citizen. If, as in the &lt;i&gt;Kepner&lt;/i&gt; case, the trial judge had rendered a verdict of acquittal, the guarantee against double jeopardy would prevent a new trial of the old offense. I see no difference when the appellate court orders a judgment of acquittal for lack of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If petitioner had asked for a new trial, different considerations would come into play, for then the defendant opens the whole record for such disposition as might be just. See &lt;i&gt;Bryan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 338 U. S. 552. And see &lt;i&gt;Trono&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 199 U. S. 521; &lt;i&gt;Stroud&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 251 U. S. 15, 18; &lt;i&gt;Francis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Resweber,&lt;/i&gt; 329 U. S. 459, 462. Moreover, a reversal by the appellate court on grounds of error that infected the trial would also be different, as &lt;i&gt;Palko&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Connecticut,&lt;/i&gt; 302 U. S. 319, shows. But an acquittal on the basis of lack of evidence concludes the controversy, as the &lt;i&gt;Kepner&lt;/i&gt; case holds, and puts it at rest under the protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause, absent a motion by the defendant for a new trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Argued February 10, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided March 7, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oscar H. Davis&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Burger&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Melvin Richter.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Harold B. Finn&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Cletus Keating&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Robert E. Kline, Jr.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*352&lt;/span&gt; MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Renegotiation Act of 1942 as amended sets up departmental and Tax Court procedures to save the United States from the burden of "excessive profits" made by private contractors under war contracts with Government "Departments."&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The question in this case is whether an order entered by the Tax Court under that Act is reviewable by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1941 the Maritime Commission, defined as a "Department" in the Act, was charged with responsibility for aiding the British Government in the transport of war equipment and supplies for use in World War II. Respondent, California Eastern Line, Inc., among others, was asked by the Commission to carry supplies to the Red Sea area for the African campaign. After extensive negotiations respondent agreed with the Commission on detailed contractual terms for the carriage. And it was agreed that respondent would be paid by the Commission out of funds appropriated by Congress under the so-called Lend-Lease Act.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; It was also understood that a written contract embodying only the terms previously agreed on would be executed between the respondent and the British Ministry of Transport. The charter was executed after respondent's boat had already sailed with its war cargo. In accordance with its agreement, the Commission paid the respondent about $351,000 for the carriage. Later the Commission chairman, after conforming with required procedure, determined that respondent should repay $164,000 as "excessive profits." Respondent took the matter to the Tax Court under &#167; 403 (e) (1) of the Act which authorizes that court "to finally determine the amount, if any, of excessive profits" and provides that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*353&lt;/span&gt; "such determination shall not be reviewed or redetermined by any court or agency." But that court made no finding or determination at all about profits. It disposed of the whole case by finding as a fact and holding as a matter of law that the only contract was in the written charter with the British Ministry in which the Commission was not named as a party and that consequently the Commission had made no renegotiable contract within &#167; 403 (e) (1) of the Renegotiation Act. 17 T. C. 1325.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States sought review in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit under the broad grant of jurisdiction in 26 U. S. C. &#167; 1141 which vests Courts of Appeals with "exclusive jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Tax Court . . . ."&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; The Court of Appeals held that &#167; 1141 does authorize review of Tax Court renegotiation orders with the exception of determinations as to profits which &#167; 403 (e) (1) of the Renegotiation Act states shall not be reviewed by any court or agency. Viewing the issue decided by the Tax Court as coming within the nonreviewable category, the Court of Appeals dismissed. 93 U. S. App. D. C. 289, 211 F. 2d 635. The Ninth Circuit has construed &#167; 1141 differently, however, holding that it gives Courts of Appeals no power whatever to review Tax Court renegotiation orders. &lt;i&gt;French&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;War Contracts Price Adjustment Board,&lt;/i&gt; 182 F. 2d 560. Never having passed on this jurisdictional question, we granted certiorari to decide it. 348 U. S. 810.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language of &#167; 1141 is broad enough to justify review of Tax Court renegotiation orders. And we cannot say that because the section was originally passed primarily to authorize review of decisions on revenue matters it &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*354&lt;/span&gt; should be held inapplicable to decisions on other justiciable matters entrusted to the Tax Court by Congress. As long ago as 1946 the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia interpreted &#167; 1141 as authorizing review of renegotiation orders.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; It has followed that interpretation in a number of later cases, including this one.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; All of these cases, however, have recognized that the scope of &#167; 1141 review over renegotiation orders is narrowed by that part of the Renegotiation Act that makes nonreviewable Tax Court determinations of amounts of excess profits, if any. This reconciliation of &#167; 1141 with the Renegotiation Act has a permissible basis, and accordingly we see no reason to upset the review practice that has grown up under it. Under this practice, the particular order here is reviewable under &#167; 1141 unless it is a determination of "the amount, if any, of excessive profits" within the meaning of &#167; 403 (e) (1) of the Act. The Court of Appeals, relying on &lt;i&gt;Macauley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Waterman S. S. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 327 U. S. 540, held that it was. On this point we disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In making determinations as to excess profits the Tax Court must decide at least two separate but interrelated questions: (1) whether a renegotiable contract is involved and (2) the amount if any of excessive profits. We held in the &lt;i&gt;Waterman&lt;/i&gt; case that the Tax Court has primary, exclusive jurisdiction to decide whether a contract is renegotiable. That result was reached because the Act gives the Tax Court exclusive jurisdiction to determine the amount of profits and the existence of a &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*355&lt;/span&gt; renegotiable contract is essential to such a determination. In &lt;i&gt;Waterman,&lt;/i&gt; however, we did not decide any question concerning the reviewability of Tax Court orders entered under the Renegotiation Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language and history of the Renegotiation Act make it pretty clear that the Tax Court was selected to handle excess profits cases because of that Court's special familiarity with all kinds of business and accounting practices in regard to profits, losses, etc. Thus it is easy to understand why Congress in &#167; 403 (e) (1) spelled out with meticulous clarity that Tax Court determinations of the amount of excessive profits, if any, should be final and nonreviewable. We agree that a &#167; 1141 Court of Appeals review should not upset such determinations. But we do not agree that the Tax Court's determination here is in that category. The question of the amount of profits was not even reached by the Tax Court. It simply held, relying largely on common law principles of contract law, that there was no government contract to renegotiate. The existence or nonexistence of profits was wholly irrelevant to the holding. Consequently this is not the kind of determination that &#167; 403 (e) (1) makes final and the Tax Court's decision in this case is therefore subject to the normal type of review authorized by &#167; 1141.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Decided March 14, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*386&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Hayden C. Covington&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;John F. Davis&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Beatrice Rosenberg&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;J. F. Bishop.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner was born in 1927 and was brought up as a Jehovah's Witness by his parents, both of whom were of that faith. He has been identified with the sect since he was 6 years old, "was immersed and became a consecrated servant of Jehovah" at 15, and was ordained when 17 years old. He registered with his local Board in 1948, and, although he worked 44 hours a week for the Railway Express Company, he was first classified as a minister. In 1950, however, petitioner was reclassified for general service and, shortly thereafter, he filed his conscientious objector claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the special form, petitioner included this statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The nature of my claim is that: I am already in the Army of Christ Jesus serving as a soldier of Jehovah's appointed Commander Jesus Christ. (2 Tim. 2:3 &amp;amp; 4). Inasmuch as the war weapons of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*387&lt;/span&gt; the soldier of Jesus Christ are not carnal, I am not authorized by his Commander to engage in carnal warfare of this world. (2 Corinthians 10:3 &amp;amp; 4, Ephesians 6:11-18) Furthermore being enlisted in the army of Jesus Christ, I cannot desert the forces of Jehovah to assume the obligations of a soldier in any army of this world without being guilty of desertion and suffering the punishment meted out to deserters by Almighty God. . . ."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In answer to the question, "Under what circumstances, if any, do you believe in the use of force," he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Only in the interests of defending Kingdom Interests, our preaching work, our meetings, our fellow brethren and sisters and our property against attack. I (as well as all Jehovah's Witnesses) defend those when they are attacked and are forced to protect such interests and scripturally so. Because in doing so we do not arm ourselves or carry carnal weapons in anticipation of or in preparation for trouble or to meet threats. In doing so I try to ward off blows and attacks only in defense. I do not use weapons of warfare in defense of myself or the Kingdom interests. I do not retreat when attacked in my home or at meeting places, but will retreat on public or other property and shake the dust off my feet; so not giving what is holy to dogs and not throwing my pearls before swine. (Matthew 10:14 &amp;amp; 7:6) So I retreat when I can do so and avoid a fight or trouble. Also following the admonition at Acts 24:16; which states `In this respect, indeed, I am exercising myself continually to have a consciousness of committing no offense against God and man.' "&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon a denial of this claim by the local Board, petitioner appealed and his file was referred to the Department of Justice. It appears that the report of the Federal Bureau &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*388&lt;/span&gt; of Investigation contained nothing unfavorable to petitioner's claim, and the hearing officer concluded that petitioner should be classified as a conscientious objector. In advising the Department of Justice, the hearing officer wrote that he "was convinced that [petitioner] has sincere objections to military service by reason of his religious training and beliefs." The Department of Justice, although admitting that the investigation was favorable to petitioner, recommended to the Appeal Board that petitioner's claim be denied on the ground that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"While the registrant may be sincere in the beliefs he has expressed, he has, however, failed to establish that he is opposed to war in any form. As indicated by the statements on his SSS Form No. 150, registrant will fight under some circumstances, namely in defense of his ministry, Kingdom Interests, and in defense of his fellow brethren. He is, therefore, not entitled to exemption within the meaning of the Act."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Appeal Board retained petitioner in his I-A classification, and thereafter, when duly ordered to report, he refused to submit to induction. This prosecution followed and the Seventh Circuit affirmed petitioner's conviction. 213 F. 2d 911. We granted certiorari. 348 U. S. 812.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, unlike &lt;i&gt;Witmer, ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 375, it is admitted that petitioner is sincere; we are therefore relieved of the task of searching the record for basis in fact to support a finding of insincerity. The only question presented in this case is one of law&#151;do the beliefs which petitioner says he holds amount to the conscientious opposition to "participation in war in any form" demanded by Congress as a prerequisite to the conscientious objector deferment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*389&lt;/span&gt; Stated in the light of the background, the question at issue is whether a registrant under the Universal Military Training and Service Act, who is admittedly a sincere Jehovah's Witness and conscientious objector to participation in war, but who believes in the use of force in defending "his ministry, Kingdom interests and . . . his fellow brethren," is entitled to exemption under &#167; 6 (j) of the Act from service in the armed forces. The Government insists that petitioner's statements reveal qualified and varied objection to war&#151;and that "petitioner's willingness to fight in defense of `Kingdom Interests', particularly when those words are considered in the light of the teachings of his sect, . . ." is clearly not opposition to war in any form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government does not contend that the petitioner's belief in the use of force in self-defense, as well as the defense of his home, family and associates, is so inconsistent with his claim of conscientious objection as to serve as a basis for a denial of his claim.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; The question here narrows to whether the willingness to use of force in defense of Kingdom interests and brethren is sufficiently inconsistent with petitioner's claim as to justify the conclusion that he fell short of being a conscientious objector. Throughout his selective service form, petitioner emphasized that the weapons of his warfare were spiritual, not carnal. He asserted that he was a soldier in the Army of Jesus Christ and that "the war weapons of the soldier of Jesus Christ are not carnal." With reference to the defense of his ministry, his brethren and Kingdom interests, he asserted that "we do not arm ourselves or carry carnal weapons . . . . I do not use weapons of warfare in defense. . . of Kingdom interests . . . ." In letters to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*390&lt;/span&gt; the local Board he reiterated these beliefs. On their face, these statements make it clear that petitioner's defense of "Kingdom Interests" has neither the bark nor the bite of war as we unfortunately know it today. It is difficult for us to believe that the Congress had in mind this type of activity when it said the thrust of conscientious objection must go to "participation in war in any form."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Government urges that these statements of petitioner must be taken in the light of the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses. While each case must of necessity be based on the particular beliefs of the individual registrant, it is true that the Congress, by relating the registrant's conscientious objection to his religious training and belief, has made the belief of his sect relevant. Moreover, the petitioner does parenthetically say that his belief in the use of force was "as well . . . [the belief of] all Jehovah's Witnesses." On the other hand, though the Government has appended to its brief a copy of the Watchtower magazine of February 1, 1951, we do not find any such literature in the record. It is not at all clear that we may consider such material outside the record to support an Appeal Board decision, cf. &lt;i&gt;Cox&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 332 U. S. 442, 453-455 (1947), but we need not decide that here because in any event there is no substance to the Government's contention. Granting that these articles picture Jehovah's Witnesses as antipacifists, extolling the ancient wars of the Israelites and ready to engage in a "theocratic war" if Jehovah so commands them, and granting that the Jehovah's Witnesses will fight at Armageddon, we do not feel this is enough. The test is not whether the registrant is opposed to all war, but whether he is opposed, on religious grounds, to &lt;i&gt;participation&lt;/i&gt; in war. As to theocratic war, petitioner's willingness to fight on the orders of Jehovah is tempered by the fact that, so far as we know, their history records &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*391&lt;/span&gt; no such command since Biblical times and their theology does not appear to contemplate one in the future. And although the Jehovah's Witnesses may fight in the Armageddon, we are not able to stretch our imagination to the point of believing that the yardstick of the Congress includes within its measure such spiritual wars between the powers of good and evil where the Jehovah's Witnesses, if they participate, will do so without carnal weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that Congress had in mind real shooting wars when it referred to participation in war in any form&#151;actual military conflicts between nations of the earth in our time&#151;wars with bombs and bullets, tanks, planes and rockets. We believe the reasoning of the Government in denying petitioner's claim is so far removed from any possible congressional intent that it is erroneous as a matter of law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals also rested its decision on the conclusion that petitioner's objection to participation in war was only a facet of his real objection to all governmental authority. We believe, however, that if the requisite objection to participation in war exists, it makes no difference that a registrant also claims, on religious grounds, other exemptions which are not covered by the Act. Once he comes within &#167; 6 (j), he does not forfeit its coverage because of his other beliefs which may extend beyond the exemption granted by Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government also contends, apparently for the first time, that petitioner objects to "participation in war in any form," if in fact he does, not from a feeling that it is wrong to participate in war but because such participation will require time which petitioner feels should be devoted to his religious activities. In its memorandum indicating its lack of opposition to certiorari, the Government gave no hint that it considered such an issue in the case, and it is unnecessary for us to consider it here. The report &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*392&lt;/span&gt; of the Department of Justice to the Appeal Board clearly bases its recommendation on petitioner's willingness to "fight under some circumstances, namely in defense of his ministry, Kingdom Interests, and in defense of his fellow brethren," and we feel that this error of law by the Department, to which the Appeal Board might naturally look for guidance on such questions, must vitiate the entire proceedings at least where it is not clear that the Board relied on some legitimate ground. Here, where it is impossible to determine on exactly which grounds the Appeal Board decided, the integrity of the Selective Service System demands, at least, that the Government not recommend illegal grounds. There is an impressive body of lower court cases taking this position and we believe that they state the correct rule. Cf. &lt;i&gt;United States ex rel. Levy&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cain,&lt;/i&gt; 149 F. 2d 338, 342 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1945); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Balogh,&lt;/i&gt; 157 F. 2d 939, 943-944 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1946), judgment vacated on other grounds, 329 U. S. 692; &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Everngam,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/wvsd/85ZW/united-states-v-everngam/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;102&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (S. D. W. Va. 1951).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision below is therefore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE REED, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not important to the United States military strength that a few people eligible for military service are excused from combat and noncombatant duties as conscientious objectors. It is important to other American citizens that many without such scruples against war must serve while the few continue their assigned tasks with no exposure to danger greater than that of other civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many, by reason of religious training or moral conviction, may be opposed to certain wars declared by the Nation. But they must serve because they do not meet the test of the statute, "conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form." The Court assumes that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*393&lt;/span&gt; Sicurella's conscience permits him to participate in theocratic wars, that is, those approved by Jehovah, such as the blood and flesh wars of the Israelites. Sicurella testified he would use force in defense of "Kingdom Interests." Those words also seem to me to include theocratic wars. Under the assumption of the Court and petitioner's statements, he is not covered by the statutory exemption. His position is inconsistent with his claimed opposition to war. I would require him to serve in the military service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE MINTON, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings and classification made by the Selective Service Board and the Appeal Board are final. 50 U. S. C. App. (1952 ed.) &#167; 460 (b) (3). This Court does not sit as a court of review. It is not our province to substitute our judgment of the facts for that of the Board or to correct the Board's errors of law unless they are so wanton, arbitrary and capricious as to destroy the jurisdiction of the Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Court said in &lt;i&gt;Estep&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 327 U. S. 114, at pp. 122-123:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The provision making the decisions of the local boards `final' means to us that Congress chose not to give administrative action under this Act the customary scope of judicial review which obtains under other statutes. It means that the courts are not to weigh the evidence to determine whether the classification made by the local boards was justified. The decisions of the local boards made in conformity with the regulations are final &lt;i&gt;even though they may be erroneous.&lt;/i&gt; The question of jurisdiction of the local board is reached only if there is no basis in fact for the classification which it gave the registrant." (Emphasis added.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*394&lt;/span&gt; In that case, Estep had claimed that his classification was made arbitrarily and capriciously. This is always a question of jurisdiction. Was the Board acting in wanton disregard of its legal boundaries? If it was not, but made what we might consider an honest mistake in judgment, this Court should not intervene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the instant case, the Court does not say that the Board acted capriciously and arbitrarily or that the judgment of the Board was not an allowable judgment of reasonable men. The Court states that a mistake in advice was made by the Department of Justice to the Appeal Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The report of the Department of Justice . . . clearly bases its recommendation on petitioner's willingness to `fight under some circumstances, namely in defense of his ministry, Kingdom Interests, and in defense of his fellow brethren,' and we feel that this error of law by the Department, to which the Appeal Board might naturally look for guidance on such questions, must vitiate the entire proceedings . . . ."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be noted that the Court says there was error of law not by the Appeal Board but by the Department of Justice, whose recommendation is purely advisory and not binding upon the Appeal Board. 50 U. S. C. App. (1952 ed.) &#167; 456 (j). The Court concludes that the Department of Justice committed an error of law by recommending to the Appeal Board that the petitioner be denied conscientious objector classification because of petitioner's willingness to "fight under some circumstances, namely in defense of his ministry, Kingdom Interests, and in defense of his fellow brethren." The record in this case clearly establishes that this was the position and attitude of the petitioner as a faithful Jehovah's Witness. Petitioner &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*395&lt;/span&gt; says he is opposed to fighting a secular war but is not opposed to fighting a religious war where the interests of his sect are involved. This does not meet the test of the statute, 50 U. S. C. App. (1952 ed.) &#167; 456 (j), which provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Nothing contained in this title [sections 451-454 and 455-471 of this Appendix] shall be construed to require any person to be subject to combatant training and service in the armed forces of the United States who, by reason of religious training and belief, is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petitioner is not opposed to "participation in war in any form." That is the congressional test. On the contrary, he reserves the right to choose the wars in which he will fight. The petitioner refused even to be inducted for any kind of limited service, combatant or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court's opinion gives the impression that the petitioner and his sect would not use force. In petitioner's own statement to the Board, he contradicts such a position. SSS Form No. 150, filled out by the petitioner and submitted to the Board, contains the following question and answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"5. Under what circumstances, if any, do you believe in the use of force?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Only in the interests of defending Kingdom Interests, our preaching work, our meetings, our fellow brethren and sisters and our property against attack. I (as well as all Jehovah's Witnesses) defend those when they are attacked and are forced to protect such interests and scripturally so. Because in doing so we do not arm ourselves or carry carnal weapons in anticipation of or in preparation for trouble or to meet threats."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*396&lt;/span&gt; This answer clearly shows that the petitioner and his sect will fight for Kingdom Interests, whatever that is, preaching work, their meetings, their fellow brethren and sisters, and their property. They do not, they say, carry carnal weapons in anticipation of attack, but they will use them in case of attack. This evidence clearly supports the District Court's finding of guilt; and the conclusion of the Selective Service Board based on such evidence was an allowable one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the Department of Justice might very well have believed petitioner did not meet the test laid down by Congress. By accepting the Department's recommendation, the Board might have been mistaken, but it was an honest mistake. There is not the slightest intimation of arbitrary or capricious conduct on the part of the Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we do not sit to review errors of fact or law unless the latter be so arbitrary and capricious as to destroy the Board's jurisdiction, and because I think the decision of the Appeal Board, even if the Board accepted and relied upon the recommendation of the Department of Justice, was an honest opinion and, therefore, an allowable judgment not arbitrarily and capriciously made, I would affirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]  In &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Taffs,&lt;/i&gt; in which we denied certiorari, 347 U. S. 928, the Government admitted as much in its petition. Its admission here does not extend to the category "brethren" which was not used in &lt;i&gt;Taffs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;No. 164.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued February 1, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided March 14, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*376&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Hayden C. Covington&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;J. F. Bishop&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Olney, John F. Davis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Beatrice Rosenberg.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner, a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses, stands convicted of failing to submit to induction into the armed forces in violation of &#167; 12 (a) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, 62 Stat. 622, 50 U. S. C. App. &#167; 462 (a). On trial, he centered his defense on the contention that he was wrongfully denied exemption as a conscientious objector. This Term, we have been asked to review a relatively large number of criminal prosecutions involving various procedural and substantive problems encountered in effectuating the congressional policy of exempting conscientious objectors from military service. We have granted petitions for certiorari in this and the three following cases to consider certain of the problems recurring in these prosecutions.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 6 (j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, 62 Stat. 612, as amended, 50 U. S. C. App. &#167; 456 (j), provides that no person who, "by reason of religious training and belief, is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form," shall be required to undergo combatant training or service in the armed forces. The conscientious objector, to prove his claim, fills out a questionnaire in which he makes a short statement of his religious beliefs and cites evidence, such as prior public expression of his views, to demonstrate his sincerity. If, on the basis of this and a personal interview, the local &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*377&lt;/span&gt; Board decides that the requisite beliefs are sincerely held, the registrant will be classified a conscientious objector. If the local Board denies the claim, the registrant has a right of appeal to the Appeal Board. That Board, before reaching a final decision, refers the registrant's file to the Department of Justice for "inquiry and hearing." As the first step in this auxiliary procedure, the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigates the registrant's claim and refers its report to a hearing officer of the Department of Justice. The registrant may then appear before this officer to present evidence and witnesses in his behalf. After this, the hearing officer makes a report to his superiors in the Department of Justice, suggesting a disposition of the case. The Department, after reviewing the registrant's file, the FBI report and the report of the hearing officer, writes a short recommendation, stating its reasons and whether it has concurred in or overruled the suggestion of the hearing officer. This recommendation of the Department of Justice is transmitted to the Appeal Board and placed in the registrant's file. The statute provides that "the appeal board shall, in making its decision, give consideration to, but shall not be bound to follow, the recommendation of the Department of Justice . . . ." 62 Stat. 613, 50 U. S. C. App. &#167; 456 (j). The Appeal Board, then, on the basis of the registrant's full file before it, comes to its conclusion, which, in the usual case, is the final determination of the Selective Service System. 62 Stat. 620, 50 U. S. C. App. &#167; 460 (b) (3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no direct judicial review of the actions of the Appeal Boards. Questions concerning the classification of the registrant may be raised either in a petition for habeas corpus or as a defense to prosecution for failure to submit to induction into the armed forces. All four of the cases decided today have arisen through the latter route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*378&lt;/span&gt; On January 31, 1951, Witmer filed his classification questionnaire, together with an explanatory letter stating that he worked 40 hours a week in a hat factory and also cultivated a portion of his father's farm. In the letter, Witmer stated that he intended to bring more of the farm under cultivation and closed, "For this reason I am appealing to you to grant me an agricultural classification as I assure you that I will increase production year after year, and contribute a satisfactory amount for the war effort and civilian use."&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his general questionnaire, Witmer expressly disclaimed any ministerial exemption by writing the phrase, "Does not apply," opposite the line inquiring whether he was a "Minister, or Student Preparing for the Ministry." He did claim to be a conscientious objector, however, although, on the special form for those claiming such classifications, he failed to fill in the specifications supporting his objections to combatant or noncombatant service. On this special form. Witmer wrote "My training and belief in relation to a Supreme Being involves duties superior to those arising from any human relation. This prevents me from turning aside from those superior duties which I owe to a superior Being." Therefore, he wrote, he was required to maintain neutrality in the "combats of this world." and was permitted the use of force only "at the command of Almighty God." Although he inserted a negative answer to the question asking whether he had given public expression to his conscientious objector views, he claimed that he had demonstrated his convictions by studying the Bible and by telling others about God's Kingdom and "of how He will put a stop to all wars."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 21, 1951, the local Board classified Witmer I-A, denying his claims for classification as a farmer &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*379&lt;/span&gt; and a conscientious objector. Eight days later, he wrote the Board advising them that he intended to appeal from their action and requesting classification as "a minister of the gospel." Less than a week after posting this claim, he left his job in the hat factory, and shortly thereafter, at his appearance before the local Board, Witmer presented an affidavit from a local officer of the Jehovah's Witnesses that he had "on many occasions" engaged in the "preaching of the good news or gospel to others." At the same time, he submitted a written statement that he carried Bibles and study aids from door to door, and, further, that one could be ordained as a minister of the Jehovah's Witnesses without attending a seminary or performing funeral or marriage ceremonies. In this statement Witmer wrote, "The work that I now do is of greatest universal importance therefore I could not take part in a conflict of national or even international importance." At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board felt the evidence did not warrant classification as a minister and "informed the registrant his case would be sent up to the Appeal Board following his physical examination."&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*380&lt;/span&gt; The Appeal Board, pursuant to the Act, forwarded the case to the Department of Justice. Apparently, the FBI report contained nothing unfavorable to petitioner and even included statements that he appeared "very religious and very sincere" and that he had said it was wrong to go to war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Department hearing, Witmer asserted that he could not engage in noncombatant service since he felt that "the boy who makes the snow balls is just as responsible as the boy who throws them." On the basis of the entire file, including the FBI report and the interview, the hearing officer suggested a conscientious objector classification. The Department of Justice, however, concluded that Witmer's inconsistent statements, together with his offer to contribute to the war effort, precluded such a classification and recommended to the Appeal Board that Witmer's claim be denied. After consideration, that Board retained petitioner in I-A, and when ordered to report for induction, he refused to submit. This prosecution followed, and Witmer's conviction, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;115&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 213 F. 2d 95. We granted certiorari. 348 U. S. 812.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary question here is whether, under the facts of this case, the narrow scope of review given this Court permits us to overturn the Selective Service System's refusal to grant petitioner conscientious objector status. It is well to remember that it is not for the courts to sit as super draft boards, substituting their judgments on &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*381&lt;/span&gt; the weight of the evidence for those of the designated agencies. Nor should they look for substantial evidence to support such determinations. &lt;i&gt;Dickinson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 346 U. S. 389, 396 (1953). The classification can be overturned only if it has "no basis in fact." &lt;i&gt;Estep&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 327 U. S. 114, 122 (1946). In &lt;i&gt;Dickinson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 346 U. S. 389 (1953), the most recent case in which this Court has applied this standard to the facts of a particular case, we set aside the conviction, holding that the local Board had wrongfully denied the registrant a ministerial classification. The objective facts on which Dickinson based his claim as a full-time minister were undisputed, and they placed him squarely within the terms of the Act. It was not for the Board to say whether he was motivated by sincere religious principles in becoming a minister, or whether his convictions were deep, but merely, as the Act provides, whether he was a "regular or duly ordained minister of religion" as therein defined. The Court therefore held that the local Board's decision was without basis in fact, there being no evidence "incompatible with the registrant's proof of exemption" to rebut his prima facie case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner argues from this that there was no specific evidence here incompatible with his claimed conscientious objector status. But in &lt;i&gt;Dickinson&lt;/i&gt; the registrant made out his prima facie case by means of objective facts&#151; he was a "regular or duly ordained minister of religion." Here the registrant cannot make out a prima facie case from objective facts alone, because the ultimate question in conscientious objector cases is the sincerity of the registrant in objecting, on religious grounds, to participation in war in any form. In these cases, objective facts are relevant only insofar as they help in determining the sincerity of the registrant in his claimed belief, purely a subjective question. In conscientious objector cases, therefore, any fact which casts doubt on the veracity &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*382&lt;/span&gt; of the registrant is relevant. It is "affirmative evidence. . . that a registrant has not painted a complete or accurate picture . . . ." &lt;i&gt;Dickinson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, supra,&lt;/i&gt; p. 396. In short, the nature of a registrant's prima facie case determines the type of evidence needed to rebut his claim. If the issue is the nature of his activities, as in &lt;i&gt;Dickinson,&lt;/i&gt; the evidence providing "basis in fact" must tend to show that his activities are other than as stated. If, as here, the issue is the registrant's sincerity and good faith belief, then there must be some inference of insincerity or bad faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Witmer stated his beliefs with apparent sincerity, and since we find no indication anywhere in the record that his demeanor appeared shifty or evasive or that his appearance was one of unreliability, we must examine the objective facts before the Appeal Board to see whether they cast doubt on the sincerity of his claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We note that when Witmer asked his Board for classification as a farmer, he knew that the land involved in his request had not been cultivated for 23 years, save for a few acres used for family purposes. At that time, he swore that the ministerial classification did not apply to him. Yet in March&#151;after he knew his claim for exemption as a farmer had been denied&#151;he just as fervently claimed he was a full-time minister.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; Furthermore, although he asserted his conscientious objector belief in his first exemption claim, in the same set of papers he promised to increase his farm production and "contribute a satisfactory amount for the war effort." Subsequently, he announced "the boy who makes the snow balls is just as responsible as the boy who throws them." These inconsistent statements in themselves &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*383&lt;/span&gt; cast considerable doubt on the sincerity of petitioner's claim. This is not merely a case of a registrant's claiming three separate classifications; it goes to his sincerity and honesty in claiming conscientious objection to participation in war. It would not be mere suspicion or speculation for the Board to conclude, after denying Witmer's now-abandoned claims of farmer and minister, that he was insincere in his claim of conscientious objection. Even firemen become dubious after two false alarms. Aside from an outright admission of deception&#151;to expect which is pure naivety&#151;there could be no more competent evidence against Witmer's claimed classification than the inference drawn from his own testimony and conduct. There are other indications which, while possibly insignificant standing alone, in this context help support the finding of insincerity. Among these is petitioner's failure to adduce evidence of any prior expression of his allegedly deeply felt religious convictions against participation in war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With due regard for the policy of Congress, which was to make review within the Selective Service System final in all cases where there was conflicting evidence or where two inferences could be drawn from the same testimony, we cannot hold that petitioner was wrongfully denied the conscientious objector classification. In short, there was basis in fact for the Board's decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner also complains of the local Board's action in not formally reopening his case at the March 19, 1951, meeting when he filed his application for reassimilation as a minister. According to the testimony of the clerk of the Board, the Board chairman had stated that the case was out of their hands because petitioner had taken an appeal. The record of this hearing, however, shows that Witmer did offer his proof, and that the Board did discuss the matter. The chairman then told Witmer that the new evidence he submitted did not entitle him to a ministerial &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*384&lt;/span&gt; exemption. It is true that &#167; 1624.2 (b) and (c) of the Selective Services Regulations, 32 CFR (1949 ed.), required that the case be reopened and the registrant reclassified. However, in view of the concurrent findings of the trial judge and the Court of Appeals that there had, in fact, been a reconsideration of Witmer's claims and that he was then personally advised of his continuance in the I-A classification, we think the command of the regulation to &lt;i&gt;reopen&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;reclassify&lt;/i&gt; was honored, even though the Board's action was not tagged with these words. In this state of the record, the contention of Witmer narrows down to mere caviling. No prejudice is claimed from this and we find no error. The judgment is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE MINTON, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the Board's order was an allowable one under the law and not arbitrarily taken, I concur in the result in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Because of the wide divergencies in the problems presented, we shall consider the cases before us in separate opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The record indicates that this farm had not been worked for 23 years, except for a garden tract used for family purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  The minute of the local Board meeting is as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"March 19, 1951&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Re: Order # XX-XX-XX-XX Philip Andrew Witmer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Board met with registrant today. The registrant informed the Board that he left his place of employment on March 3, where he had worked for three years in a hat factory. The Board chairman immediately pointed out that he was classified as 1-A on February 21, which meant he left his position about two weeks later. He then mentioned that his father had a farm which had not been worked as a farm for 23 years but that he felt he was going to start getting this farm in shape. Prior to this time he stated he had gotten a few acres in shape for their own family use so that they would not be dependent upon other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The registrant then pointed out that he was a minister of the Gospel and the only evidence he presented to substantiate this fact was some paraphernalia from the Watchtower Association of the Jehovah Witness [&lt;i&gt;sic&lt;/i&gt;]. The registrant was asked if he was an ordained minister and he said Jehovah [&lt;i&gt;sic&lt;/i&gt;] Witnesses became ordained when they started distributing their literature. The Board felt this was not sufficient evidence to warrant a 4-D Classification and informed the registrant his case would be sent up to the Appeal Board following his physical examination." R. 33-34, 54-55.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Ordinarily the claim of a Jehovah's Witness to exemption as a minister, though unfounded in law, would not reflect adversely on his good faith, since it is the doctrine of the Jehovah's Witnesses that all are ministers.&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF CLAIMS.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*273&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;James Craig Peacock&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Martin W. Meyer, William L. Paul, Jr., John E. Skilling&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;John H. Myers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ralph A. Barney&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Morton&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;John C. Harrington.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefs of &lt;i&gt;amici curiae&lt;/i&gt; were filed on behalf of the States of Idaho, by &lt;i&gt;Robert E. Smylie,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;J. Clinton Peterson,&lt;/i&gt; Assistant Attorney General; New Mexico, by &lt;i&gt;Richard H. Robinson,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;Fred E. Wilson,&lt;/i&gt; Special Assistant Attorney General; and Utah, by &lt;i&gt;E. R. Callister,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case rests upon a claim under the Fifth Amendment by petitioner, an identifiable group of American Indians of between 60 and 70 individuals residing in Alaska, for compensation for a taking by the United States of certain timber from Alaskan lands allegedly belonging to the group.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The area claimed is said to contain over 350,000 acres of land and 150 square miles of water. The Tee-Hit-Tons, a clan of the Tlingit Tribe, brought this suit in the Court of Claims under 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1505. The compensation claimed does not arise from any statutory direction to pay. Payment, if it can be compelled, must be based upon a constitutional right of the Indians to recover. This is not a case that is connected with any phase of the policy of the Congress, continued throughout our history, to extinguish Indian title through negotiation rather than by force, and to grant payments &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*274&lt;/span&gt; from the public purse to needy descendants of exploited Indians. The legislation in support of that policy has received consistent interpretation from this Court in sympathy with its compassionate purpose.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon petitioner's motion, the Court of Claims under its Rule 38 (b)&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; directed a separate trial with respect to certain specific issues of law and any related issues of fact essential to the proper adjudication of the legal issues.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; Only those pertinent to the nature of the petitioner's interest, if any, in the lands are here for review. Substantial &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*275&lt;/span&gt; evidence, largely documentary, relevant to these legal issues was introduced by both parties before a Commissioner who thereupon made findings of fact. The Court of Claims adopted these findings and held that petitioner was an identifiable group of American Indians residing in Alaska; that its interest in the lands prior to purchase of Alaska by the United States in 1867 was "original Indian title" or "Indian right of occupancy." &lt;i&gt;Tee-Hit-Ton Indians&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wC8/united-states-v-klamath-indians/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;128&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ct. Cl.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;82&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 85, 87, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/cc/9cHW/tee-hit-ton-indians-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;120&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;202&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 203-204, 205. It was further held that if such original Indian title survived the Treaty of 1867, 15 Stat. 539, Arts. III and VI, by which Russia conveyed Alaska to the United States, such title was not sufficient basis to maintain this suit as there had been no recognition by Congress of any legal rights in petitioner to the land in question. 128 Ct. Cl., at 92, 120 F. Supp., at 208. The court said that no rights inured to plaintiff by virtue of legislation by Congress. As a result of these conclusions, no answer was necessary to questions 2, 5 and 6. The Tee-Hit-Tons' petition was thereafter dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of general agreement as to the importance of the question of compensation for congressionally approved taking of lands occupied in Alaska under aboriginal Indian use and claim of ownership,&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; and the conflict concerning the effect of federal legislation protecting &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*276&lt;/span&gt; Indian occupation between this decision of the Court of Claims, 128 Ct. Cl., at 90, 120 F. Supp., at 206-207, and the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in &lt;i&gt;Miller&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 159 F. 2d 997, 1003, we granted certiorari, 347 U. S. 1009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Alaskan area in which petitioner claims a compensable interest is located near and within the exterior lines of the Tongass National Forest. By Joint Resolution of August 8, 1947, 61 Stat. 920, the Secretary of Agriculture was authorized to contract for the sale of national forest timber located within this National Forest "notwithstanding any claim of possessory rights."&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; The Resolution defines "possessory rights"&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; and provides for all receipts from the sale of timber to be maintained in a special account in the Treasury until the timber and land rights are finally determined.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; Section 3 (b) of the Resolution provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Nothing in this resolution shall be construed as recognizing or denying the validity of any claims of possessory rights to lands or timber within the exterior boundaries of the Tongass National Forest."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of Agriculture, on August 20, 1951, pursuant to this authority contracted for sale to a private company of all merchantable timber in the area claimed by petitioner. This is the sale of timber which petitioner &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*277&lt;/span&gt; alleges constitutes a compensable taking by the United States of a portion of its proprietary interest in the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem presented is the nature of the petitioner's interest in the land, if any. Petitioner claims a "full proprietary ownership" of the land; or, in the alternative, at least a "recognized" right to unrestricted possession, occupation and use. Either ownership or recognized possession, petitioner asserts, is compensable. If it has a fee simple interest in the entire tract, it has an interest in the timber and its sale is a partial taking of its right to "possess, use and dispose of it." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;General Motors Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 323 U. S. 373, 378. It is petitioner's contention that its tribal predecessors have continually claimed, occupied and used the land from time immemorial; that when Russia took Alaska, the Tlingits had a well-developed social order which included a concept of property ownership; that Russia while it possessed Alaska in no manner interfered with their claim to the land; that Congress has by subsequent acts confirmed and recognized petitioner's right to occupy the land permanently and therefore the sale of the timber off such lands constitutes a taking &lt;i&gt;pro tanto&lt;/i&gt; of its asserted rights in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government denies that petitioner has any compensable interest. It asserts that the Tee-Hit-Tons' property interest, if any, is merely that of the right to the use of the land at the Government's will; that Congress has never recognized any legal interest of petitioner in the land and therefore without such recognition no compensation is due the petitioner for any taking by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I. &lt;i&gt;Recognition.&lt;/i&gt;&#151;The question of recognition may be disposed of shortly. Where the Congress by treaty or other agreement has declared that thereafter Indians were to hold the lands permanently, compensation must be paid &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*278&lt;/span&gt; for subsequent taking.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; The petitioner contends that Congress has sufficiently "recognized" its possessory rights in the land in question so as to make its interest compensable. Petitioner points specifically to two statutes to sustain this contention. The first is &#167; 8 of the Organic Act for Alaska of May 17, 1884, 23 Stat. 24.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; The second is &#167; 27 of the Act of June 6, 1900, which was to provide for a civil government for Alaska, 31 Stat. 321, 330.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; The Court of Appeals in the &lt;i&gt;Miller&lt;/i&gt; case, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; felt that these Acts constituted recognition of Indian ownership. 159 F. 2d 997, 1002-1003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have carefully examined these statutes and the pertinent legislative history and find nothing to indicate any intention by Congress to grant to the Indians any permanent rights in the lands of Alaska occupied by them by permission of Congress. Rather, it clearly appears that what was intended was merely to retain the &lt;i&gt;status quo&lt;/i&gt; until further congressional or judicial action was taken.&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt; There is no particular form for congressional recognition of Indian right of permanent occupancy. It may be established in a variety of ways but there must be &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*279&lt;/span&gt; the definite intention by congressional action or authority to accord legal rights, not merely permissive occupation. &lt;i&gt;Hynes&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Grimes Packing Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 337 U. S. 86, 101.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This policy of Congress toward the Alaskan Indian lands was maintained and reflected by its expression in the Joint Resolution of 1947 under which the timber contracts were made.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;II. &lt;i&gt;Indian Title.&lt;/i&gt;&#151;(a) The nature of aboriginal Indian interest in land and the various rights as between the Indians and the United States dependent on such interest are far from novel as concerns our Indian inhabitants. It is well settled that in all the States of the Union the tribes who inhabited the lands of the States held claim to such lands after the coming of the white man, under what is sometimes termed original Indian title or permission from the whites to occupy. That description means mere possession not specifically recognized as ownership by Congress. After conquest they were permitted to occupy portions of territory over which they had previously exercised "sovereignty," as we use that term. This is not a property right but amounts to a right of occupancy which the sovereign grants and protects against intrusion by third parties but which right of occupancy may be terminated and such lands fully disposed of by the sovereign itself without any legally enforceable obligation to compensate the Indians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This position of the Indian has long been rationalized by the legal theory that discovery and conquest gave the conquerors sovereignty over and ownership of the lands thus obtained. 1 Wheaton's International Law, c. V. The great case of &lt;i&gt;Johnson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McIntosh,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wheat.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;543&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, denied the power of an Indian tribe to pass their &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*280&lt;/span&gt; right of occupancy to another. It confirmed the practice of two hundred years of American history "that discovery gave an exclusive right to extinguish the Indian title of occupancy, either by purchase or by conquest." P. 587.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We will not enter into the controversy, whether agriculturists, merchants, and manufacturers, have a right, on abstract principles, to expel hunters from the territory they possess, or to contract their limits. Conquest gives a title which the Courts of the conqueror cannot deny, whatever the private and speculative opinions of individuals may be, respecting the original justice of the claim which has been successfully asserted." P. 588.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Frequent and bloody wars, in which the whites were not always the aggressors, unavoidably ensued. European policy, numbers, and skill, prevailed. As the white population advanced, that of the Indians necessarily receded. The country in the immediate neighbourhood of agriculturists became unfit for them. The game fled into thicker and more unbroken forests, and the Indians followed. The soil, to which the crown originally claimed title, being no longer occupied by its ancient inhabitants, was parcelled out according to the will of the sovereign power, and taken possession of by persons who claimed immediately from the crown, or mediately, through its grantees or deputies." Pp. 590-591. See &lt;i&gt;Buttz&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Northern Pacific R. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 119 U. S. 55, 66; &lt;i&gt;Martin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Waddell,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Pet.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;367&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 409; &lt;i&gt;Clark&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Smith,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/rAh/clark-v-smith/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Pet.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;195&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 201.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Beecher&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wetherby,&lt;/i&gt; 95 U. S. 517, a tract of land which Indians were then expressly permitted by the United States to occupy was granted to Wisconsin. In &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*281&lt;/span&gt; a controversy over timber, this Court held the Wisconsin title good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The grantee, it is true, would take only the naked fee, and could not disturb the occupancy of the Indians: that occupancy could only be interfered with or determined by the United States. It is to be presumed that in this matter the United States would be governed by such considerations of justice as would control a Christian people in their treatment of an ignorant and dependent race. Be that as it may, the propriety or justice of their action towards the Indians with respect to their lands is a question of governmental policy, and is not a matter open to discussion in a controversy between third parties, neither of whom derives title from the Indians. The right of the United States to dispose of the fee of lands occupied by them has always been recognized by this court from the foundation of the government." P. 525.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1941 a unanimous Court wrote, concerning Indian title, the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Extinguishment of Indian title based on aboriginal possession is of course a different matter. The power of Congress in that regard is supreme. The manner, method and time of such extinguishment raise political, not justiciable, issues." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Santa Fe Pacific R. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 314 U. S. 339, 347.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No case in this Court has ever held that taking of Indian title or use by Congress required compensation. The American people have compassion for the descendants of those Indians who were deprived of their homes and hunting grounds by the drive of civilization. They seek to have the Indians share the benefits of our society as citizens of this Nation. Generous provision has been willingly &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*282&lt;/span&gt; made to allow tribes to recover for wrongs, as a matter of grace, not because of legal liability. 60 Stat. 1050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) There is one opinion in a case decided by this Court that contains language indicating that unrecognized Indian title might be compensable under the Constitution when taken by the United States. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tillamooks,&lt;/i&gt; 329 U. S. 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovery was allowed under a jurisdictional Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 801, that permitted payments to a few specific Indian tribes for "legal and equitable claims arising under or growing out of the original Indian title" to land, because of some unratified treaties negotiated with them and other tribes. The other tribes had already been compensated.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; Five years later this Court unanimously held that none of the former opinions in Vol. 329 of the United States Reports expressed the view that recovery was grounded on a taking under the Fifth Amendment. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tillamooks,&lt;/i&gt; 341 U. S. 48. Interest, payable on recovery for a taking under the Fifth Amendment, was denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the second &lt;i&gt;Tillamook&lt;/i&gt; case, a decision was made on Alaskan Tlingit lands held by original Indian title. &lt;i&gt;Miller&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 159 F. 2d 997. That opinion holds such a title compensable under the Fifth Amendment on reasoning drawn from the language of this Court's first &lt;i&gt;Tillamook&lt;/i&gt; case.&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt; After the &lt;i&gt;Miller&lt;/i&gt; decision, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*283&lt;/span&gt; this Court had occasion to consider the holding of that case on Indian title in &lt;i&gt;Hynes&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Grimes Packing Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 337 U. S. 86, 106, note 28. We there commented as to the first &lt;i&gt;Tillamook&lt;/i&gt; case: "That opinion does not hold the Indian right of occupancy compensable without specific legislative direction to make payment." We further declared "we cannot express agreement with that [compensability of Indian title by the &lt;i&gt;Miller&lt;/i&gt; case] conclusion."&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later the Government used the &lt;i&gt;Hynes&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Grimes Packing Co&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; note in the second &lt;i&gt;Tillamook&lt;/i&gt; case, petition for certiorari, p. 10, to support its argument that the first &lt;i&gt;Tillamook&lt;/i&gt; opinion did not decide that taking of original Indian title was compensable under the Fifth Amendment.&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt; Thereupon this Court in the second &lt;i&gt;Tillamook&lt;/i&gt; case, 341 U. S. 48, held that the first case was not "grounded on a taking under the Fifth Amendment." Therefore no interest was due. This later &lt;i&gt;Tillamook&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*284&lt;/span&gt; decision by a unanimous Court supported the Court of Claims in its view of the law in this present case. See &lt;i&gt;Tee-Hit-Ton Indians&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 128 Ct. Cl., at 87, 120 F. Supp., at 204-205. We think it must be concluded that the recovery in the &lt;i&gt;Tillamook&lt;/i&gt; case was based upon statutory direction to pay for the aboriginal title in the special jurisdictional act to equalize the Tillamooks with the neighboring tribes, rather than upon a holding that there had been a compensable taking under the Fifth Amendment.&lt;sup&gt;[18]&lt;/sup&gt; This leaves unimpaired the rule derived &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*285&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;i&gt;Johnson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McIntosh&lt;/i&gt; that the taking by the United States of unrecognized Indian title is not compensable under the Fifth Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is true, not because an Indian or an Indian tribe has no standing to sue or because the United States has not consented to be sued for the taking of original Indian title, but because Indian occupation of land without government recognition of ownership creates no rights against taking or extinction by the United States protected by the Fifth Amendment or any other principle of law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(c) What has been heretofore set out deals largely with the Indians of the Plains and east of the Mississippi. The Tee-Hit-Tons urge, however, that their stage of civilization and their concept of ownership of property takes them out of the rule applicable to the Indians of the States. They assert that Russia never took their lands in the sense that European nations seized the rest of America. The Court of Claims, however, saw no distinction between their use of the land and that of the Indians of the Eastern United States. See &lt;i&gt;Tee-Hit-Ton Indians&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wC8/united-states-v-klamath-indians/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;128&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ct. Cl.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;82&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 87, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/cc/9cHW/tee-hit-ton-indians-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;120&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;202&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 204-205. That court had no evidence that the Russian handling of the Indian land problem differed from ours. The natives were left the use of the great part of their vast hunting and fishing territory but what Russia wanted for its use and that of its licensees, it took. The court's conclusion on this issue was based on strong evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In considering the character of the Tee-Hit-Tons' use of the land, the Court of Claims had before it the testimony of a single witness who was offered by plaintiff. He stated that he was the chief of the Tee-Hit-Ton tribe. He qualified as an expert on the Tlingits, a group composed of numerous interconnected tribes including the Tee-Hit-Tons. His testimony showed that the Tee-Hit-Tons had become greatly reduced in numbers. Membership descends &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*286&lt;/span&gt; only through the female line. At the present time there are only a few women of childbearing age and a total membership of some 65.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The witness pointed out that their claim of ownership was based on possession and use. The use that was made of the controverted area was for the location in winter of villages in sheltered spots and in summer along fishing streams and/or bays. The ownership was not individual but tribal. As the witness stated, "Any member of the tribe may use any portion of the land that he wishes, and as long as he uses it that is his for his own enjoyment, and is not to be trespassed upon by anybody else, but the minute he stops using it then any other member of the tribe can come in and use that area."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Russians first came to the Tlingit territory, the most important of the chiefs moved the people to what is now the location of the town of Wrangell. Each tribe took a portion of Wrangell harbor and the chief gave permission to the Russians to build a house on the shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The witness learned the alleged boundaries of the Tee-Hit-Ton area from hunting and fishing with his uncle after his return from Carlisle Indian School about 1904. From the knowledge so obtained, he outlined in red on the map, which petitioner filed as an exhibit, the territory claimed by the Tee-Hit-Tons. Use by other tribal members is sketchily asserted. This is the same 350,000 acres claimed by the petition. On it he marked six places to show the Indians' use of the land: (1) his great uncle was buried here, (2) a town, (3) his uncle's house, (4) a town, (5) his mother's house, (6) smokehouse. He also pointed out the uses of this tract for fishing salmon and for hunting beaver, deer and mink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The testimony further shows that while membership in the tribe and therefore ownership in the common property &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*287&lt;/span&gt; descended only through the female line, the various tribes of the Tlingits allowed one another to use their lands. Before power boats, the Indians would put their shelters for hunting and fishing away from villages. With the power boats, they used them as living quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to this verbal testimony, exhibits were introduced by both sides as to the land use. These exhibits are secondary authorities but they bear out the general proposition that land claims among the Tlingits, and likewise of their smaller group, the Tee-Hit-Tons, was wholly tribal. It was more a claim of sovereignty than of ownership. The articles presented to the Court of Claims by those who have studied and written of the tribal groups agree with the above testimony. There were scattered shelters and villages moved from place to place as game or fish became scarce. There was recognition of tribal rights to hunt and fish on certain general areas, with claims to that effect carved on totem poles. From all that was presented, the Court of Claims concluded, and we agree, that the Tee-Hit-Tons were in a hunting and fishing stage of civilization, with shelters fitted to their environment, and claims to rights to use identified territory for these activities as well as the gathering of wild products of the earth.&lt;sup&gt;[19]&lt;/sup&gt; We think this evidence introduced by both sides confirms the Court of Claims' conclusion &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*288&lt;/span&gt; that the petitioner's use of its lands was like the use of the nomadic tribes of the States Indians.&lt;sup&gt;[20]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line of cases adjudicating Indian rights on American soil leads to the conclusion that Indian occupancy, not &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*289&lt;/span&gt; specifically recognized as ownership by action authorized by Congress, may be extinguished by the Government without compensation.&lt;sup&gt;[21]&lt;/sup&gt; Every American schoolboy knows that the savage tribes of this continent were deprived &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*290&lt;/span&gt; of their ancestral ranges by force and that, even when the Indians ceded millions of acres by treaty in return for blankets, food and trinkets, it was not a sale but the conquerors' will that deprived them of their land. The duty that rests on this Nation was adequately phrased by Mr. Justice Jackson in his concurrence, MR. JUSTICE BLACK joining, in &lt;i&gt;Shoshone Indians&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 324 U. S. 335, at 355, a case that differentiated "recognized" from "unrecognized" Indian title, and held the former only compensable. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 339-340. His words will be found at 354-358. He ends thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We agree with MR. JUSTICE REED that no legal rights are today to be recognized in the Shoshones by reasons of this treaty. We agree with MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE MURPHY as to their moral deserts. We do not mean to leave the impression that the two have any relation to each other. The finding that the treaty creates no legal obligations does not restrict Congress from such appropriations as its judgment dictates `for the health, education, and industrial advancement of said Indians,' which is the position in which Congress would find itself if we found that it did create legal obligations and tried to put a value on them." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 358.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the light of the history of Indian relations in this Nation, no other course would meet the problem of the growth of the United States except to make congressional contributions for Indian lands rather than to subject the Government to an obligation to pay the value when taken with interest to the date of payment. Our conclusion &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*291&lt;/span&gt; does not uphold harshness as against tenderness toward the Indians, but it leaves with Congress, where it belongs, the policy of Indian gratuities for the termination of Indian occupancy of Government-owned land rather than making compensation for its value a rigid constitutional principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Court of Claims is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER concur, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Organic Act for Alaska became a law on May 17, 1884, 23 Stat. 24. It contained a provision in &#167; 8 which reads as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"the Indians or other persons in said district shall not be disturbed in the possession of any lands actually in their use or occupation or now claimed by them but the terms under which such persons may acquire title to such lands is reserved for future legislation by Congress: &lt;i&gt;And provided further,&lt;/i&gt; That parties who have located mines or mineral privileges therein under the laws of the United States applicable to the public domain, or who have occupied and improved or exercised acts of ownership over such claims, shall not be disturbed therein, but shall be allowed to perfect their title to such claims by payment as aforesaid."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 12 provided for a report upon "the condition of the Indians residing in said Territory, what lands, if any, should be reserved for their use, what provision shall be made for their education[,] what rights by occupation of settlers should be recognized," etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent contends, and the Court apparently agrees, that this provision should be read, not as recognizing Indian &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*292&lt;/span&gt; title, but as reserving the question whether they have any rights in the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is said that since &#167; 8 contemplates the possible future acquisition of "title," it expressly negates any idea that the Indians have any "title." That is the argument; and that apparently is the conclusion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, it seems to me, two answers to that proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;First.&lt;/i&gt; The first turns on the words of the Act. The general land laws of the United States were not made applicable to Alaska. &#167; 8. No provision was made for opening up the lands to settlement, for clearing titles, for issuing patents, all as explained in Gruening, The State of Alaska (1954), p. 47 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; There were, however, at least two classes of claimants to Alaskan lands&#151;one, the Indians; the other, those who had mining claims. Section 8 of the Act did not recognize the "title" of either. Rather, it provided that one group, the miners, should be allowed to "perfect their title"; while the others, the Indians, were to acquire "title" only as provided by future legislation. Obviously the word "title" was used in the conveyancer's sense; and &#167; 8 did service in opening the door to perfection of "title" in the case of miners, and in deferring the perfection of "title" in the case of the Indians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Second.&lt;/i&gt; The second proposition turns on the legislative history of &#167; 8. Section 8 of the Act commands that the Indians "shall not be disturbed in the possession of any lands actually in their use or occupation or now claimed by them." The words "or now claimed by them" were added by an amendment offered during the debates by Senator Plumb of Kansas. 15 Cong. Rec. 627-628. Senator Benjamin Harrison, in accepting the amendment, said, ". . . it was the intention of the committee to protect to the fullest extent all the rights of the Indians in Alaska and of any residents who had settled there, but &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*293&lt;/span&gt; at the same time to allow the development of the mineral resources . . . ." &lt;i&gt;Id.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Plumb spoke somewhat humorously about the rights of the Indians:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I do not know by what tenure the Indians are there nor what ordinarily characterizes their claim of title, but it will be observed that the language of the proviso I propose to amend puts them into very small quarters. I think about 2 feet by 6 to each Indian would be the proper construction of the language `actually in their use or occupation.' Under the general rule of occupation applied to an Indian by a white man, that would be a tolerably limited occupation and might possibly land them in the sea." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 530.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Plumb went on to say, "I propose that the Indian shall at least have as many rights after the passage of this bill as he had before." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 531. Senator Harrison replied that it was the intention of the committee "to save from all possible invasion the rights of the Indian residents of Alaska." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 531. He gave emphasis to the point by this addition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It was the object of the committee absolutely to save the rights of all occupying Indians in that Territory until the report which is provided for in another section of the bill could be made, when the Secretary of the Interior could ascertain what their claims were and could definitely define any reservations that were necessary to be set apart for their use. We did not intend to allow any invasion of the Territory by which private rights could be acquired by any person except in so far as it was necessary in order to establish title to mining claims in the Territory. Believing that that would occupy but the smallest portion of the territory here and there, isolated and detached &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*294&lt;/span&gt; and small quantities of ground, we thought the reservation of lands occupied by the Indians or by anybody else was a sufficient guard against any serious invasion of their rights." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 531.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion seems clear that Congress in the 1884 Act recognized the claims of these Indians to their Alaskan lands. What those lands were was not known. Where they were located, what were their metes and bounds, were also unknown. Senator Plumb thought they probably were small and restricted. But all agreed that the Indians were to keep them, wherever they lay. It must be remembered that the Congress was legislating about a Territory concerning which little was known. No report was available showing the nature and extent of any claims to the land. No Indian was present to point out his tribe's domain. Therefore, Congress did the humane thing of saving to the Indians all rights claimed; it let them keep what they had prior to the new Act. The future course of action was made clear&#151;conflicting claims would be reconciled and the Indian lands would be put into reservations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That purpose is wholly at war with the one now attributed to the Congress of reserving for some future day the question whether the Indians were to have any rights to the land.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*295&lt;/span&gt; There remains the question what kind of "title" the right of use and occupancy embraces. Some Indian rights concern fishing alone. See &lt;i&gt;Tulee&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Washington,&lt;/i&gt; 315 U. S. 681. Others may include only hunting or grazing or other limited uses. Whether the rights recognized in 1884 embraced rights to timber, litigated here, has not been determined by the finders of fact. The case should be remanded for those findings. It is sufficient now only to determine that under the jurisdictional Act the Court of Claims is empowered to entertain the complaint by reason of the recognition afforded the Indian rights by the Act of 1884.&lt;/p&gt;

S. 373, and &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Klamath Indians,&lt;/i&gt; 304 U. S. 119. These cases, however, concern Government taking of lands held under Indian title recognized by the United States as an Indian reservation. See 185 U. S., at 390, 304 U. S., at 121, 16 Stat. 707, &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Algoma Lumber Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 305 U. S. 415, 420, and 329 U. S. 40, 52, note 29. See &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;10.95 Acres of Land,&lt;/i&gt; 75 F. Supp. 841.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[16]  The statement concerning the &lt;i&gt;Miller&lt;/i&gt; case was needed to meet the Grimes Packing Company argument that Congress could not have intended to authorize the Interior Department to include an important and valuable fishing area, see &lt;i&gt;Hynes&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Grimes Packing Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 337 U. S., at 95, note 10, in a permanent reservation for an Indian population of 57 eligible voters. Actual occupation of Alaskan lands by Indians authorized the creation of a reservation. 337 U. S., at 91. One created by Congress through recognition of a permanent right in the Indians from aboriginal use would require compensation to them for reopening to the public. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 103-106. It was therefore important to show that there was no right arising from aboriginal occupation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[17]  Three million dollars was involved in the &lt;i&gt;Tillamook&lt;/i&gt; case as the value of the land, and the interest granted by the Court of Claims was $14,000,000. The Government pointed out that if aboriginal Indian title was compensable without specific legislation to that effect, there were claims with estimated interest already pending under the Indian jurisdictional act aggregating $9,000,000,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[18]  In &lt;i&gt;Carino&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Insular Government of the Philippine Islands,&lt;/i&gt; 212 U. S. 449, this Court did uphold as valid a claim of land ownership in which tribal custom and tribal recognition of ownership played a part. Petitioner was an Igorot who asserted the right to register ownership of certain land although he had no document of title from the Spanish Government and no recognition of ownership had been extended by Spain or by the United States. The United States Government had taken possession of the land for a public use and disputed the fact that petitioner had any legally recognizable title.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basis of the Court's decision, however, distinguishes it from applicability to the Tee-Hit-Ton claim. The Court relied chiefly upon the purpose of our acquisition of the Philippines as disclosed by the Organic Act of July 1, 1902, which was to administer property and rights "for the benefit of the inhabitants thereof." 32 Stat. 695. This purpose in acquisition and its effect on land held by the natives was distinguished from the settlement of the white race in the United States where "the dominant purpose of the whites in America was to occupy the land." 212 U. S., at 458. The Court further found that the Spanish law and exercise of Spanish sovereignty over the islands tended to support rather than defeat a prescriptive right. Since this was no communal claim to a vast uncultivated area, it was natural to apply the law of prescription rather than a rule of sovereign ownership or dominium. Carino's claim was to a 370-acre farm which his grandfather had fenced some fifty years before and was used by three generations as a pasture for livestock and some cultivation of vegetables and grain. The case bears closer analogy to the ordinary prescriptive rights situation rather than to a recognition by this Court of any aboriginal use and possession amounting to fee simple ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 2 Alaska 224.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[20]  It is significant that even with the Pueblo Indians of the Mexican Land Sessions, despite their centuries-old sedentary agricultural and pastoral life, the United States found it proper to confirm to them a title in their lands. The area in which the Pueblos are located came under our sovereignty by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, 9 Stat. 922, and the Gadsden Purchase Treaty of December 30, 1853, 10 Stat. 1031. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo contained a guarantee by the United States to respect the property rights of Mexicans located within the territory acquired. Art. VIII, 9 Stat. 929. This provision was incorporated by reference into the Gadsden Treaty. Art. V, 10 Stat. 1035. The latter treaty also contained a provision that no grants of land within the ceded territory made after a certain date would be recognized or any grants "made previously [would] be respected or be considered as obligatory which have not been located and duly recorded in the archives of Mexico." Art. VI, 10 Stat. 1035. This provision was held to bar recognition of fee ownership in the Pueblo of Santa Rosa which claimed such by immemorial use and possession as well as by prescription against Spain and Mexico because they could produce no paper title to the lands. &lt;i&gt;Pueblo of Santa Rosa&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fall,&lt;/i&gt; 56 App. D. C. 259, 262, 12 F. 2d 332, 335, reversed on other grounds, 273 U. S. 315.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disputes as to the Indian titles in the Pueblos and their position as wards required congressional action for settlement. See Brayer, Pueblo Indian Land Grants of the "Rio Abajo," New Mexico; Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law, c. 20. These problems were put in the way of solution only by congressional recognition of the Pueblos' title to their land and the decisions of this Court as to their racial character as Indians, subject to necessary federal tutelage. 10 Stat. 308, Creation of Office of Surveyor-General of New Mexico to report area of bona fide holdings; Report of Secretary of the Interior, covering that of the Surveyor-General of New Mexico, S. Exec. Doc. No. 5, 34th Cong., 3d Sess. 174, 411; Confirmation of titles for approved Pueblo Land Claims, 11 Stat. 374; S. Doc. No. 1117, 37th Cong., 2d Sess. 581-582, Report of Secretary of Interior showing New Mexico Pueblos with confirmed titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Sandidge, who reported the first Pueblo Confirmation Act to the House of Representatives, stated that the Pueblo claims, "although they are valid, are not held to be so by this Government, nor by any of its courts, until the claim shall have been acted on specifically. I will say, furthermore, that the whole land system of the Territory of New Mexico is held in abeyance until these private land claims shall have been acted on by Congress." Cong. Globe, 35th Cong., 1st Sess. 2090 (1858).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The position as Indians of the inhabitants of the Pueblos was considered in &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Joseph,&lt;/i&gt; 94 U. S. 614, and &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sandoval,&lt;/i&gt; 231 U. S. 28.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an interesting sidelight on the difficulties inherent in the problems, see Brayer, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; p. 14, and &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ritchie,&lt;/i&gt; 17 How. 525.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus it is seen that congressional action was deemed necessary to validate the ownership of the Pueblos whose claim was certainly founded upon stronger legal and historical basis than the Tlingits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[21]  The Departments of Interior, Agriculture and Justice agree with this conclusion. See Committee Print No. 12, Supplemental Reports dated January 11, 1954, on H. R. 1921, 83d Cong., 2d Sess.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Department of Interior: "That the Indian right of occupancy is not a property right in the accepted legal sense was clearly indicated when &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Alcea Band of Tillamooks,&lt;/i&gt; 341 U. S. 48 (1951), was reargued. The Supreme Court stated, in a per curiam decision, that the taking of lands to which Indians had a right of occupancy was not a taking within the meaning of the fifth amendment entitling the dispossessed to just compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Since possessory rights based solely upon aboriginal occupancy or use are thus of an unusual nature, subject to the whim of the sovereign owner of the land who can give good title to third parties by extinguishing such rights, they cannot be regarded as clouds upon title in the ordinary sense of the word. Therefore, we suggest the deletion, in section 3 (c) of the bill, of the words `upon aboriginal occupancy or title, or.' " P. 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Department of Agriculture: "We also concur in the belief which we understand is being expressed by the Department of the Interior that no rights presently exist on the basis of aboriginal occupancy or title. We believe that this is equally true with respect to lands within the Tongass National Forest just as it is with respect to lands elsewhere in Alaska." P. 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Department of Justice: "Thus, there is no legal or equitable basis for claims or rights allegedly arising from `aboriginal occupancy or title.' " P. 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]  The reading which the Court gives the 1884 Act dispels the slight hope which Ernest Gruening, our foremost Alaskan authority, found in its provisions dealing with the Indians. In The State of Alaska (1954) 355-356, Gruening states:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For the first seventeen years of United States rule over Alaska, the aboriginal inhabitants, who constituted an overwhelming majority of its approximately thirty thousand souls, were as devoid of attention, or even mention, as was the population as a whole. They became, by virtue of the organic act of 1884, in one respect at least, a mildly privileged, or at least a less disadvantaged, group, as compared with subsequently arriving Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For the act provided `that the Indians or other persons . . . shall not be disturbed in the possession of any lands actually in their use or occupation or now claimed by them.' The natives' right of occupancy was, in other words, affirmed, while all later arrivals had to await the slow evolution of the land laws for even the assurance of the right to possess land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;" `The terms under which such persons [the Indians or other persons],' continued the act, `may acquire title to such lands is reserved for future legislation by Congress.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Seventy years of future had passed by 1954 and the legislation by which the titles to Indians' lands could be acquired had not yet been enacted by Congress."&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*398&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Hayden C. Covington&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Robert W. Ginnane&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Beatrice Rosenberg&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Carl H. Imlay.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case presents another question concerning the processing of conscientious objector claims under the Universal Military Training and Service Act. Petitioner contends that the failure of the Department of Justice to furnish him with a fair resume of all adverse information in the Federal Bureau of Investigation report deprived him of the "hearing" provided by &#167; 6 (j) of the Act, 62 Stat. 612, as amended, 50 U. S. C. App. &#167; 456 (j), and thereby invalidated his I-A classification. In the circumstances of this case, we conclude that a fair resume, as contemplated in &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Nugent,&lt;/i&gt; 346 U. S. 1 (1953), was not furnished petitioner, and that this deprived him of a fair hearing within the terms of the Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner registered under the selective service laws in 1948. He was then employed as a chauffeur at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center, having had 8 years of grade school and 2 1/2 years of high school. At that time, he did not claim to be a minister or a conscientious objector, but stated that he believed his classification &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*399&lt;/span&gt; should be I-A. The local Board so classified him. In 1949, petitioner was married, and on June 4, 1951, he was given a dependency deferment, which was terminated on October 22, 1951. Within a week of his restoration to I-A, petitioner filed the special form for conscientious objectors, claiming exemption from combatant and noncombatant service. In this and in subsequent statements to the selective service authorities, petitioner revealed that he had first been contacted by a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses in November 1949; that he had started a Bible study course at that time and had progressed gradually toward the status of minister; that he had become an unordained minister in December 1950, and an ordained minister in October 1951; that he preached from house to house and on the streets, giving public expression to his conscientious objections to war; that the demands of his "ministry" and the commands of the Bible, admonishing him not to kill and to follow God rather than men, precluded his participation in the military; and that he would not use force "[u]nless it be under the supervision of Jehovah God." After a personal appearance, in which petitioner sought exemption as a minister rather than as a conscientious objector, the local Board continued him in I-A. Petitioner filed an appeal. The Appeal Board tentatively found against him, and referred the case to the Department of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, petitioner was notified to appear for a hearing. No copy of the notice appears in the record, but it appears that the form sent to registrants during the period in question stated that the hearing officer would advise the registrant "as to the general nature and character" of adverse evidence in the FBI report if he requested such information "at any time after receipt by him of the notice of hearing and before the date &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*400&lt;/span&gt; set for the hearing."&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; There is no evidence that petitioner made such a request prior to the hearing. He did, however, make a request at the hearing. According to petitioner's uncontradicted testimony, the hearing officer told him that the FBI report disclosed that he had been hanging around poolrooms, and the hearing officer asked him if he did that now. Petitioner replied that he did not, and asked what else was in the report. The hearing officer changed the subject. He subsequently asked petitioner's wife how she was feeling and how petitioner was treating her. Her reply was "fine." The hearing officer reported that petitioner impressed him as sincere, but recommended that he be classified I-A because his religious activities coincided with pressure from the Draft Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its report to the Appeal Board, the Department of Justice adopted the hearing officer's recommendation, relying on the timing of petitioner's religious activities and "his abusiveness and the exercise of physical violence towards his wife."&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; The latter reason rested on data presumably gathered by the FBI. According to the Department's &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*401&lt;/span&gt; report, police records showed that petitioner was arrested and fined in May 1950 for hitting his wife; that the police were called upon to settle a "hot argument" in June 1950; and that petitioner's wife claimed in January &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*402&lt;/span&gt; 1952 that he was "abusive" towards her. Also narrated in the report, although not specifically relied on in making the recommendation, is the statement of a "confidential informant" that prior to his recent religious activity petitioner had been "a rather heavy drinker and crap shooter in and around local taverns and pool halls."&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Petitioner was continued in I-A by the Appeal Board. He refused to submit to induction and this prosecution followed. On trial, petitioner claimed that he had not been afforded a fair summary of the FBI report and secured the issuance of a subpoena &lt;i&gt;duces tecum&lt;/i&gt; requiring production of the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*403&lt;/span&gt; original report. On motion of the Government, and over objection of petitioner, the subpoena was quashed. Thereafter petitioner was convicted, and the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed, 213 F. 2d 901.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 6 (j) of the Act provides that "[t]he Department of Justice, after appropriate inquiry, shall hold a hearing with respect to the character and good faith" of the claimed conscientious objections. In &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Nugent, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; we held that this "hearing" did not entail disclosure of the secret FBI reports. In reaching this conclusion, however, we relied on the availability to the registrant of a fair resume of these reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;". . . We think the Department of Justice satisfies its duties under &#167; 6 (j) when it accords a fair opportunity to the registrant to speak his piece before an impartial hearing officer; when it permits him to produce all relevant evidence in his own behalf and at the same time supplies him with a fair resume of any adverse evidence in the investigator's report." 346 U. S., at 6.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not view this provision for a fair summary as a matter of grace within the Department's discretion, but rather as an essential element in the processing of conscientious objector claims. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Nugent&lt;/i&gt; represented a balancing between the demands of an effective system for mobilizing the Nation's manpower in times of crisis and the demands of fairness toward the individual registrant. We permitted the FBI report to remain secret because we were of the view that other safeguards in the proceeding, particularly the furnishing of a fair resume, maintained the basic elements of fair play. If the balance struck in &lt;i&gt;Nugent&lt;/i&gt; is to be preserved, the registrant must receive the fair summary to which he is entitled. The Department expressly recognizes this and, since &lt;i&gt;Nugent,&lt;/i&gt; has furnished each registrant, at the time &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*404&lt;/span&gt; he is notified of the hearing, with a written resume of the information developed in the FBI report, a copy of which is also placed in his file for use by the Appeal Board.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government assumes that the Department of Justice is required to furnish the registrant with a fair resume upon request. But it contends that petitioner failed to make a timely request for the summary; that the remarks of the hearing officer gave him adequate notice of the unfavorable evidence in the FBI report; and, finally, that the lack of notice, if there was such, was harmless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to the request for the summary, the Government must rely on a document which is not in the record and which was not open to attack or explanation in the trial court. Indeed, had the Government produced the form notice in the lower courts, petitioner might have been able to show that he had made a request prior to the hearing. But leaving these difficulties aside, the notice reproduced in the Government's brief does not, in our view, convey clearly to the layman the idea that he must make a request for the resume prior to the hearing or forever waive his rights in this respect.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; There is nothing in either the statute or the regulations authorizing such a waiver. And the discussion of this point in &lt;i&gt;Nugent,&lt;/i&gt; 346 U. S., at 6, n. 10, was not directed at the time or method of requesting the resume, but only at its availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That petitioner never received a fair resume of the unfavorable evidence gleaned by the FBI seems hardly arguable on this record. As to his alleged gambling and drinking, the hearing officer merely told petitioner that he was reported to have been hanging around pool rooms. And &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*405&lt;/span&gt; as to the reported incidents of violence and abuse towards his wife, the hearing officer, in an apparent aside, advanced only the general query to petitioner's wife, asking her how petitioner was treating her now. A fair resume is one which will permit the registrant to defend against the adverse evidence&#151;to explain it, rebut it, or otherwise detract from its damaging force. The remarks of the hearing officer at most amounted to vague hints, and these apparently failed to alert petitioner to the dangers ahead. Certainly they afforded him no fair notice of the adverse charges in the report. The Congress, in providing for a hearing, did not intend for it to be conducted on the level of a game of blindman's buff. The summary was inadequate and the hearing in the Department was therefore lacking in basic fairness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government's argument that no prejudice was shown and none resulted can be readily disposed of. Relying on a case concerned with constitutional restrictions on the States in regulating public utilities, &lt;i&gt;Market Street Railway Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Railroad Comm'n of California,&lt;/i&gt; 324 U. S. 548, it contends that the petitioner must specifically show prejudice in order to question the fairness of the resume. The holding of the &lt;i&gt;Market Street Railway&lt;/i&gt; case was that the Due Process Clause was "not to be trivialized by formal objections that have no substantial bearing on the ultimate rights of parties," that the Commission could make "incidental reference" to the railroad's own reports to verify its judgment, formulated on the basis of the entire record, without introducing the reports in evidence. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 562. We are not now dealing with constitutional limitations. We are endeavoring to apply a procedure, set forth by Congress, in accordance with the statutory plan and the concepts of basic fairness which underlie all our legislation. We have held that to meet its duty under &#167; 6 (j) the Department must furnish the registrant with a fair resume of the FBI report. It is clear in the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*406&lt;/span&gt; circumstances of this case that it has failed to do so, and that petitioner has thereby been deprived of an opportunity to answer the charges against him. This is not an incidental infringement of technical rights. Petitioner has been deprived of the fair hearing required by the Act, a fundamental safeguard, and he need not specify the precise manner in which he would have used this right&#151; and how such use would have aided his cause&#151;in order to complain of the deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It being evident from the record before the Court that the Department of Justice has failed to provide petitioner with a fair resume of the FBI report, it is unnecessary for us to pass on petitioner's further contention that the trial court erred in quashing his subpoena &lt;i&gt;duces tecum.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, adhering to their dissent in &lt;i&gt;Nugent&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 346 U. S. 1, 13, join in this opinion and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE REED would affirm on the ground that, as no summary was requested, it was not necessary to furnish more to the registrant than was given by the hearing officer. See &lt;i&gt;Gonzales&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; decided today, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 407.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE MINTON, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the Board has denied petitioner a fair resume of all adverse information in the FBI reports, it does not appear to have been done arbitrarily or capriciously, and the judgment of the Board in doing so was allowable "even if erroneous." It takes more than disagreement with the Board to destroy jurisdiction, the only condition upon which courts may interfere. I would affirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The form notice appears as an appendix to the Government's brief, p. 55. The pertinent paragraph follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"2. Upon request therefor by the registrant at any time after receipt by him of the notice of hearing and before the date set for the hearing, the hearing officer will advise the registrant as to the general nature and character of any evidence in his possession which is unfavorable to, and tends to defeat, the claim of the registrant such request being granted to enable the registrant more fully to prepare to answer and refute at the hearing such unfavorable evidence."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The complete text of the report is as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Registrant is twenty-five years of age, married, born in Illinois and has completed approximately two years of high school. At the present time he is employed as a chauffeur. He was first contacted by a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses Sect in November 1949, although the exact date of membership is not reflected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The registrant believes in a Supreme Being and described the nature of his belief by citing various parts of the Scriptures, in part, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;" `Romans 13:1&#151;. . . that Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are the higher powers, and I recognize them as the supreme powers. Peter at Acts 5:59 admonishing all footstep followers of Christ Jesus that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We must obey God rather than men." Also Paul at 2 Cor. 4:4. . . Satan the Devil is the god of this system of things. Showing that we show (sic) obey the Creator rather than the Creation of God. Jehovah God in one of this ten Commandments at Ex. 20:13 "Thou shall not kill." '&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Registrant related that in November 1949, at the suggestion of one Clarence Howze, he started a Bible study and as he progressed wanted more and more to become a minister of truth. At the present time he is receiving training from the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society. As to the question regarding use of force he states 1None whatsoever. Unless it be under the supervision of Jehovah God.' He claims to engage in the work of his religion by preaching from house to house and on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At his present place of employment he has been seen reading the Bible during lunch hour and discussing same with a few Co.-workers. References, all of whom are members of the same sect, believe registrant is sincere, as do his neighbors. A confidential informant, of known reliability, reports that during the last seven or eight months registrant was actively engaged in distributing pamphlets; that prior to that time registrant was personally known to him as a rather heavy drinker and crap shooter in and around local taverns and pool halls. This informant believes registrant is now sincere. Registrant states he has changed his ways and now prays many times during the day. His wife also states he has changed. It is to be noted that registrant is reported to have had a very poor home life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Police records reflect that registrant was arrested May 29, 1950 on a complaint by his wife that he pulled her out of her car and hit her in the face&#151;fined $13.60; on June 12, 1950 police were called to settle a `hot argument' and on January 6, 1952, wife claimed registrant was abusive. Police settled last two matters so no charges were filed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The file also reflects that registrant was mailed his questionnaire on December 6, 1948 and did not sign that part (series XIV) reserved for a conscientious objection. He was classified I-A on December 23, 1948 and married his present wife on March 5, 1949.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Hearing Officers reports registrant impressed him as sincere but notes that his religious activities are coincident with pressing draft activities by officials and, therefore, recommends a I-A classification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From the available information it appears that registrant had little, if any religious training prior to November 1949 and it was not until after his 3-A classification was changed to I-A that he evidence any conscientious objection. From the time he first attended a Bible study class until approximately October 1951, registrant had a little less than two years of Jehovah's Witness religious training. In addition to the fact that his religious activities coincide with pressing induction possibilities, registrant's absorption and sincerity as to his newly found religious is rendered more questionable by his abusiveness and the exercise of physical violence towards, his wife. In this connection police records reflect a complaint by his wife as late as January 6, 1952.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"After consideration of the entire file and record, the Department of Justice fins that he registrant's objections to combatant and noncombatant service are not sustained. It is, therefore, recommended to your Board that registrant's claim for exemption from both combatant and noncombatant training and service be not sustained."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  This informant had also stated that petitioner had changed his ways and now seemed sincere. While the statement as a whole may therefore be favorable to petitioner's claim, the disclosure of petitioner's gambling and drinking activities was certainly adverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  This procedure was not in effect at the time petitioner was notified to appear for his hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  Registrants are not to be treated as though they were engaged in formal litigation assisted by counsel. &lt;i&gt;United States ex rel. Berman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Craig,&lt;/i&gt; 207 F. 2d 888; &lt;i&gt;Smith&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 157 F. 2d 176.&lt;/p&gt;

Zarky&lt;/i&gt; argued the causes for the United States. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Holland, Ellis N.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;William A. Sutherland&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner in No. 41. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Eugene M. Locke, Harold B. Pressley, Jr.&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mac Asbill, Jr.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue in these cases is whether, for the years 1940 through 1945, abatements of federal excess profits taxes, through application of I. R. C., &#167; 722,&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; are retroactive. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*256&lt;/span&gt; For the reasons hereafter stated, we hold that they are not and that they relieve taxpayers from the payment of interest on deficiencies in such taxes from the time of the abatements, rather than from the original due dates of the taxes abated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In No. 29, &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Koppers Co.,&lt;/i&gt; the taxpayer, respondent therein,&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; reported and paid excess profits taxes of $6,512.76 for 1940, and $1,781,288.14 for 1941.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; In &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*257&lt;/span&gt; computing these taxes, it used excess profits credits based upon invested capital.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; In 1943 and 1945, it applied under &#167; 722 for relief from all or part of these taxes, claiming that they were "excessive and discriminatory."&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; In accordance with the usual administrative practice, the Commissioner determined the amount of the excess profits taxes due without regard to the application for relief under &#167; 722. In doing so, he found it necessary to proceed under I. R. C., &#167; 713, using excess profits credits based upon the taxpayer's income, rather than upon its invested capital. As a result he found that the above taxes, as returned and paid by the taxpayer without reference to &#167; 722, had been understated and that the following deficiencies existed as of their original due dates, March 15, 1941, and 1942:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Excess profits tax under &#167;&#167; 710 (a) and  &lt;i&gt;1940&lt;/i&gt;    &lt;i&gt;1941&lt;/i&gt;
 713 .....................................  $466,921.67     $2,208,019.09
Payments .................................     6,512.76      1,781,288.14
                                            ___________     ______________
Deficiencies .............................   460,408.91        426,730.95
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commissioner computed interest, at 6%, on the above deficiencies, amounting to $217,376.07 for 1940, and $230,504.86 for 1941.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After extended investigations and negotiations conducted under authority of &#167; 722, the Commissioner and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*258&lt;/span&gt; the taxpayer agreed upon a "constructive average base period net income" which fixed the excess profits credits for the years in question and, as a result, the relief available under &#167; 722. After this agreement was approved by the Excess Profits Tax Council of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the Commissioner determined that the above-stated deficiencies, with the benefit of &#167; 722, should be reduced to $260,554.39 for 1940, and to $95,749.33 for 1941. The taxpayer consented to the assessment of these deficiencies, with interest as provided by law. Where-upon, the Commissioner issued a formal determination of them and assessed them against the taxpayer. He also assessed the above-stated interest charges, based upon the full amount of the original deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taxpayer paid the deficiencies and interest so assessed but claimed refunds of $94,358.71 for 1940, and $178,784.48 for 1941. Those sums represented the interest on the abatements in its excess profits taxes made under &#167; 722. When the Commissioner disallowed the claims, the taxpayer sued in the Court of Claims to recover their amounts. With one judge dissenting, that court deducted a setoff and rendered judgment in favor of the taxpayer for $270,216.34. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;126&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ct. Cl.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;847&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 117 F. Supp. 181. To resolve the resulting conflict with &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Premier Oil Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 209 F. 2d 692, we granted certiorari, 347 U. S. 965.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In No. 41, &lt;i&gt;Premier Oil Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; the taxpayer, petitioner therein, paid the excess profits taxes shown on its original returns in the following amounts: for 1943, $564,167.70 (adjusted to $560,484.84); for 1944, $353,292.15 (adjusted to $313,639.13); and for 1945, $45,679.67. Thereafter, several deductions which the taxpayer had made from its income were disallowed, resulting, in 1948, in the following deficiencies in its payment of its excess profits and income taxes as of their original due dates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the taxpayer had applied for relief under &#167; 722, seeking acceptance of a "constructive average base period net income" of $357,000 for each of the years at issue. The Excess Profits Tax Council approved that figure as a credit in lieu of $93,150.36 for each of the years 1943 and 1944, and of $116,437.95 for 1945. This credit so far reduced the taxpayer's taxable excess profits as to abate its excess profits tax deficiencies for 1943 and 1944 entirely, and that for 1945 to $366.52.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; Accordingly, the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*260&lt;/span&gt; Commissioner's assessment of the remainder of the taxpayer's deficiencies in excess profits taxes was for only $366.52. However, as in the &lt;i&gt;Koppers&lt;/i&gt; case, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; he assessed against the taxpayer the full amount of the interest charges based upon the original deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taxpayer paid the deficiency and interest so assessed but claimed refunds totaling $56,855.41. That sum represented the interest on the abatements in its excess profits taxes made under &#167; 722. When the Commissioner disallowed those claims, the taxpayer brought the instant action to recover their amounts, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, under 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1346 (a) (1). That court rendered judgment for the taxpayer.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; 107 F. Supp. 837. The Court of Appeals reversed. 209 F. 2d 692. We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict with &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Koppers Co., supra.&lt;/i&gt; 347 U. S. 987.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the underlying issue is the same in each case and for each year, we shall discuss it in relation to the 1940 taxes in the &lt;i&gt;Koppers&lt;/i&gt; case. There, the taxpayer, under the usual procedure, computed and paid the excess profits tax of $6,512.76 shown on its return for 1940. In due course the Commissioner, without the application of &#167; 722, determined that the payment should have been $466,921.67, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*261&lt;/span&gt; and, therefore, that a deficiency of $460,408.91 was due the United States, with interest from March 15, 1941. I. R. C., &#167;&#167; 53 (a), 56 (a). If the taxpayer had made no application for relief under &#167; 722, there is no doubt that such interest would have remained due the United States until paid and that, when paid, it would not have been refundable. The same would have been true if the taxpayer's application for relief under &#167; 722 had been finally denied. The taxpayer contends, however, that, because the Commissioner has abated the taxpayer's deficiency from $460,408.91 to $260,554.39 under &#167; 722, such reduction is necessarily retroactive to March 15, 1941, and that the taxpayer, accordingly, is entitled to a refund of the interest on the sum abated. The Commissioner, on the other hand, contends that the determination under &#167; 722 is not retroactive but is a current abatement effective when made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress could have prescribed either treatment but did not expressly specify either. Our answer is determined from our consideration of the statutory scheme as a whole, the related provisions of the statute, the legislative history of &#167; 722 and the administrative interpretation that has been given the statute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. &lt;i&gt;The statutory scheme as a whole.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excess profits tax was a device initiated by Congress, late in 1940, in great part for the quick collection of large sums needed by the Government in a national emergency. Congress sought to obtain those funds from abnormally high corporate profits while such profits were available. To that end, it prescribed computations of unusual profits and required prompt payment of the taxes on them.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*262&lt;/span&gt; From the beginning, the statute also provided, in &#167; 722, a means of subsequent adjustment of the tax in special instances where the normal computation of the tax was found to result in inequity. The adjustment could be made only after administrative action and, pending its consideration, it did not eliminate the tax return or the tax payment otherwise required. Until 1942, it did not permit even the postponement of the payment of any part of the standard tax. Indeed, the full payment of that tax soon was made an express condition of the application for adjustment. I. R. C., &#167; 722 (d). In 1943, Congress stated that if overpayments for either of the taxable years 1940 or 1941 were found to be attributable to &#167; 722, no interest on such overpayments was to be paid the taxpayer.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; At least to that extent, Congress expressly recognized that the funds paid as excess profits taxes, when due and without the benefit of &#167; 722, were funds owed to and usable by the Government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significance of this statutory scheme further appears when it is applied to the instant case. If the instant taxpayer had paid its required tax in 1941, the Government would have received an additional $460,408.91 at that time. Accordingly, it would have had the use of that money, without charge, during the crucial war years. Correspondingly, the taxpayer would have been without that money during the same period. Instead, the taxpayer, in fact, retained the funds for its own use and now contends that it need not compensate the Government for such use of a substantial part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in the instant case the taxpayer did not underpay any amount actually shown on its return, as contemplated by I. R. C., &#167; 294 (a), it understated its tax and thus withheld the amount in question. The detriment to the Government and benefit to the taxpayer was the same&#151;the use of $460,408.91 for eight years. The above &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*263&lt;/span&gt; distinction, emphasized by the taxpayer, may have helped it in initiating its application for relief under &#167; 722 (d) because it could establish that, at least, it had paid "the tax shown on its return." The distinction, however, supplies no ground for different results once the deficiencies have been determined. We find no implication that a self-serving error in the understatement of its tax on its tax return entitles the taxpayer to a greater ultimate tax advantage than does a self-serving error of the same size in the underpayment of the same tax. &lt;i&gt;A fortiori&lt;/i&gt; we find nothing to justify a greater tax advantage to any taxpayer that underpays its correct tax, over one that pays such tax in full when due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. &lt;i&gt;The interest here in controversy is attributable to I. R. C.,&lt;/i&gt; &#167; &lt;i&gt;292&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interest here in controversy was due under &#167; 292 (a) from March 15, 1941, until paid. Accordingly, to obtain a refund of it, the taxpayer must sustain the proposition that the tax relief granted under &#167; 722 is necessarily retroactive, extinguishing the deficiency as of the original due date of the tax and thus eliminating the interest charges for the corresponding period. To that end, the taxpayer emphasizes the statement in &#167; 722 (a) that, as a condition of securing the application of &#167; 722, a taxpayer must establish that the usual procedure "results &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*264&lt;/span&gt; in an excessive and discriminatory tax" and also must establish "what would be a fair and just amount representing normal earnings to be used as a constructive average base period net income." Once the taxpayer has done that, "the tax shall be determined by using such constructive average base period net income in lieu of the average base period net income otherwise determined under this subchapter." Standing alone, this directive language is elastic. It can be read consistently either with the interpretation that the new computation replaces and abates the old one currently, when the new one is determined and assessed, or that it retroactively replaces the old tax from its original due date. It leaves the issue open for disposition by the effect of other clauses relating more specifically to the issue. For the reasons hereafter stated, we read it as looking forward, rather than backward.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. &lt;i&gt;I. R. C.,&lt;/i&gt; &#167; &lt;i&gt;710&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;) (&lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt;),&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;permits a taxpayer, seeking relief under&lt;/i&gt; &#167; &lt;i&gt;722, to defer a part of its existing excess profits taxes where its adjusted excess profits net income exceeds 50% of its normal tax net income.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1942, Congress added &#167; 710 (a) (5), conditionally authorizing partial deferment of the tax in cases where a &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*265&lt;/span&gt; taxpayer claimed benefits under &#167; 722. The condition was that the taxpayer's "adjusted excess profits net income (computed without reference to section 722)" must exceed 50% of the taxpayer's normal tax net income for the year. Even then, deferment was limited to 33% of the benefit claimed under &#167; 722. If a taxpayer, without this amendment, could have successfully deferred payment and avoided interest charges by following the course taken in the instant cases, it could, by understatement of its tax, have deferred, without incurring interest charges, the payment of a corresponding part of its tax pending relief. If so, there would have been little need for &#167; 710 (a) (5). The 1942 amendment, by its restrictions, fairly meant that, under all other circumstances, the existing taxes were to be paid when due, or be subjected to interest during their delinquency under &#167; 292 (a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*266&lt;/span&gt; 4. &lt;i&gt;The denial of interest on refunds is prescribed by I. R. C.,&lt;/i&gt; &#167; &lt;i&gt;3771&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although &#167; 3771 (g) was not enacted until 1943, it was then made applicable to taxable years before, as well as after, January 1, 1942. It denied all interest on refunds attributable to &#167; 722 where the refunds related to the taxable years 1940 or 1941. It also denied interest on refunds relating to taxable years beginning after January 1, 1942, but limited such denials to the first year after the filing of an application for relief under &#167; 722, or to periods prior to September 16, 1945 (two years after the effective date of the amendment), whichever was the later.&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*267&lt;/span&gt; In cases where the Government has authorized refunds of excess profits taxes overpaid to it by reason of the abatement of taxes attributable to &#167; 722, &#167; 3771 (g) expressly precludes the payment of interest by the Government upon the amounts abated. This treats the Government as entitled to the use of the abated amounts between the time of their overpayment and that of their abatement. Equity demands a comparable result in the case of underpayments. Where unpaid taxes are abated by reason of &#167; 722, the taxpayer then receives a release from its existing obligation to pay the amount abated. However, the Government having been entitled, up to that time, to collect and use the sum abated, the Government should receive interest, on the abated sum, for the period during which the Government was entitled to have its use. This is the natural counterpart of the Government's freedom from paying interest on refunded overpayments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. &lt;i&gt;The legislative history of&lt;/i&gt; &#167; &lt;i&gt;722.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excess profits tax was initiated in 1940. 54 Stat. 975 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; It provided for prompt payment of large taxes computed on income reflecting unusual profits. Computation of the tax on the basis of the taxpayer's prior income or invested capital was prescribed in &#167;&#167; 713 and 714. A standardized treatment of abnormalities was provided in &#167; 721. In addition, &#167; 722 authorized the Commissioner "to make such adjustments as may be necessary to adjust abnormalities affecting income or capital." 54 Stat. 986. The procedure under &#167; 722 was formalized by the Excess Profits Tax Amendments of 1941, 55 Stat. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*268&lt;/span&gt; 23-25, and put in its final form by the Revenue Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 914-917, as amended, 57 Stat. 601-602. The technical and discretionary nature of the adjustment was emphasized by the provision that the determination of most computations under &#167; 722 was reviewable only by a special division of the Tax Court constituted for the occasion and by no other court or agency. 55 Stat. 26, as amended, 56 Stat. 917, 59 Stat. 295, 673, 26 U. S. C. &#167; 732. A taxpayer never was permitted to file a return of its own under &#167; 722. S. Rep. No. 75, 77th Cong., 1st Sess. 13; H. R. Rep. No. 146, 77th Cong., 1st Sess. 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statute has been interpreted as authorizing a procedure that is in the nature of a claim for a refund preceded by long investigations of complicated special circumstances, and followed by extended negotiations between the Commissioner and taxpayer to develop a mutually satisfactory "constructive average base period net income." This interpretation leaves the usual procedure under &#167; 710 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; complete in itself but subject, upon application, to ultimate adjustment in instances accepted by the Commissioner under &#167; 722.&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt; We find no statement of a purpose that &#167; 722 shall relieve taxpayers from penalties or interest charges due either to their defaults in paying, or their errors in computing, their taxes. On the contrary, it has been suggested that Congress considered relief under &#167; 722 to be in the nature &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*269&lt;/span&gt; of a favor and as not relieving the taxpayer of its duty to pay the original tax when due.&lt;sup&gt;[18]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulations do not deal specifically with the issue before us but, from their beginning, in Treasury Regulations 109, they have been consistent with the interpretation given the Act by the Government. See &#167; 30.722-5, as added by T. D. 5264, 1943 Cum. Bull. 761, as amended, T. D. 5393, 1944 Cum. Bull. 415. In addition to the practice of the Commissioner in the instant cases, there is in the record of the &lt;i&gt;Premier Oil Co.&lt;/i&gt; case an undisputed affidavit by a Treasury Department reviewer to the effect that the policy followed was the administrative policy of the Bureau:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is the policy of the Bureau of Internal Revenue in those cases where all or any part of a tax deficiency &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*270&lt;/span&gt; has been extinguished by application of the relief provisions of Section 722 of the Internal Revenue Code not to assess the extinguished portion of such deficiency. &lt;i&gt;However, interest has been computed and assessed on the extinguished portion of the deficiency&lt;/i&gt; from the due date of the return to the thirtieth day after the agreement, Form 874, is filed or date of assessment, whichever is the earlier." (Emphasis supplied.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;i&gt;Manning&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Seeley Tube &amp;amp; Box Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 338 U. S. 561, relates to the carry-back provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, it is thoroughly consistent in principle with the above discussion. There the Court upheld the collection of interest on a deficiency which later was extinguished by carrying back a loss which occurred in a subsequent year. It treated the carry-back as a current adjustment of the tax previously determined, characterizing it as an "abatement" at 565. It recognized I. R. C., &#167; 3771 (e), as a help to the interpretation of the statute, much as we recognize I. R. C., &#167; 3771 (g), as a help here. See 567-568. The Court also there announced that "In the absence of a clear legislative expression to the contrary, the question of who properly should possess the right of use of the money owed the Government for the period it is owed must be answered in favor of the Government." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 566.&lt;sup&gt;[19]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the deficiency for 1940 in the amount of $460,408.91 was properly determined without reference to &#167; 722 and treated as a deficiency for that year by the Commissioner, it was not separately assessed as such. This was not necessary because, at the time of its determination &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*271&lt;/span&gt; and before its assessment, it was abated to $260,554.39. The latter sum, with interest in the amount of $217,376.07 computed on the whole deficiency of $460,408.91, was correctly and adequately assessed and paid.&lt;sup&gt;[20]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Government, in each case, is entitled to retain the interest now in controversy. Therefore, in No. 29, the judgment of the Court of Claims is reversed and, in No. 41, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No. 29&lt;/i&gt;&#151;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No. 41&lt;/i&gt;&#151;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1]  "SEC. 722. GENERAL RELIEF&#151;CONSTRUCTIVE AVERAGE BASE PERIOD NET INCOME.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(a) GENERAL RULE.&#151;&lt;i&gt;In any case in which the taxpayer establishes that the tax computed under this subchapter&lt;/i&gt; [as to excess profits tax, &#167; 710 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt;] (&lt;i&gt;without the benefit of this section&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;results in an excessive and discriminatory tax and establishes what would be a fair and just amount representing normal earnings to be used as a constructive average base period net income&lt;/i&gt; for the purposes of an excess profits tax based upon a comparison of normal earnings and earnings during an excess profits tax period, &lt;i&gt;the tax shall be determined by using such constructive average base period net income in lieu of the average base period net income&lt;/i&gt; otherwise determined under this subchapter. . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(d) APPLICATION FOR RELIEF UNDER THIS SECTION.&#151;&lt;i&gt;The taxpayer shall compute its tax, file its return, and pay the tax shown on its return under this subchapter without the application of this section, except as provided in section 710&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;) (&lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt;). The benefits of this section shall not be allowed unless the taxpayer within the period of time prescribed by section 322 and subject to the limitation as to amount of credit or refund prescribed in such section makes application therefor in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary. If a constructive average base period net income has been determined under the provisions of this section for any taxable year, the Commissioner may, by regulations approved by the Secretary, prescribe the extent to which the limitations prescribed by this subsection may be waived for the purpose of determining the tax under this subchapter &lt;i&gt;for a subsequent taxable year.&lt;/i&gt;" (Emphasis supplied.) 56 Stat. 914-915, as amended, 57 Stat. 601-602, 26 U. S. C. &#167; 722 (a) (d).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above provisions of &#167; 722 (d) apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1939. 57 Stat. 602.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Koppers Company, Inc., is, in fact, the successor to Koppers United Company and its subsidiaries, which filed consolidated excess profits tax returns for the years in question. For convenience, all of such corporations are referred to as the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  This tax was computed and paid pursuant to the Excess Profits Tax Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 975, as amended. See I. R. C., &#167; 710 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; On November 8, 1945, these provisions became inapplicable to any calendar year beginning after 1945. 59 Stat. 568.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Two methods of computation of the excess profits credit were authorized: the invested capital method under I. R. C., &#167; 714, or the base period income method under I. R. C., &#167; 713.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  By timely consents, the Commissioner and the taxpayer agreed that the amount of any income, excess profits, or war profits tax due for 1940 and 1941 could be assessed at any time on or before June 30, 1951.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  The interest on the 1940 tax ran from March 15, 1941, to January 28, 1949, which was treated as the date of its payment; that on the 1941 tax ran from March 15, 1942, to March 16, 1951, which was 30 days after the filing of a waiver consenting to the assessment and collection of the deficiencies finally determined. See I. R. C., &#167; 292 (a), &lt;i&gt;infra,&lt;/i&gt; note 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  ABATEMENT OF EXCESS PROFITS TAX DEFICIENCIES UNDER &#167; 722.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Deficiencies without application  &lt;i&gt;1943&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;1944&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;1945&lt;/i&gt;
 of &#167; 722...................   $78,359.80     $55,529.92    $190,785.32

Resulting (credits) and
 deficiency ....................   (96,947.98)   (119,644.57)        366.52
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By reducing that part of the taxpayer's income that was subject to excess profits taxes, this application of &#167; 722 automatically left more of the taxpayer's income subject to the normal tax and surtax. Those increases in the taxpayer's income taxes and their consequences are not before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  The original judgment for $56,855.41 was modified to $52,292.40 to reflect several adjustments, including the deduction of $49.72, representing interest on the unabated deficiency of $366.52 upon which the taxpayer conceded that interest was chargeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9]  The grant was limited to the following question stated in the petition:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Where a deficiency in excess profits tax, based on the income and credits as shown in the taxpayer's return, would have existed except for the subsequent application of Section 722 of the Internal Revenue Code, is the taxpayer liable for interest on the amount of such deficiency (hereinafter called the `potential deficiency') which would have existed had it not been extinguished by the application of Section 722?" 347 U. S., at 988.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11]  I. R. C., &#167; 3771 (g), &lt;i&gt;infra,&lt;/i&gt; note 15, discussed at 266-267, &lt;i&gt;infra.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[12]  "SEC. 292. INTEREST ON DEFICIENCIES.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(a) GENERAL RULE.&#151;Interest upon the amount determined as a deficiency shall be assessed at the same time as the deficiency, shall be paid upon notice and demand from the collector, and shall be collected as a part of the tax, at the rate of 6 per centum per annum from the date prescribed for the payment of the tax (or, if the tax is paid in installments, from the date prescribed for the payment of the first installment) to the date the deficiency is assessed, or, in the case of a waiver under section 272 (d), to the thirtieth day after the filing of such waiver or to the date the deficiency is assessed whichever is the earlier." 53 Stat. 88, as amended, 57 Stat. 602, 26 U. S. C. &#167; 292 (a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[13]  Section 722 (d) looks forward when it provides that if a constructive base period net income has been determined under &#167; 722 for any taxable year, the Commissioner may, by regulations approved by the Secretary, permit waivers of the section's limitations for the purpose of determining excess profits taxes for a subsequent taxable year. Even this effect is not automatic, whereas it might have been expected to be so if the adjustment were a retroactive correction of the standard excess profits credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"(a) . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(5) DEFERMENT OF PAYMENT IN CASE OF ABNORMALITY.&#151;If the adjusted excess profits net income (computed without reference to section 722) for the taxable year of a taxpayer which claims on its return, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary, the benefits of section 722, is in excess of 50 per centum of its normal tax net income for such year, computed without the credit provided in section 26 (e) (relating to adjusted excess profits net income), the amount of tax payable at the time prescribed for payment may be reduced by an amount equal to 33 per centum of the amount of the reduction in the tax so claimed. For the purposes of section 271, if the tax payable is the tax so reduced, the tax so reduced shall be considered the amount shown on the return." 54 Stat. 975, as amended, 56 Stat. 917, but see also, later amendment indicated by 26 U. S. C. &#167; 710 (a) (5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate Committee on Finance Report accompanying the Revenue Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 798, stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although it is believed advisable to require a taxpayer seeking relief under section 722 to compute and pay its tax without the benefit of such section, there are some cases in which it would be inequitable to compel the taxpayer to pay the entire amount of such tax. Section 710 (a) is therefore amended to provide . . . [as above quoted]." S. Rep. No. 1631, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 205.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[15]  "SEC. 3771. INTEREST ON OVERPAYMENTS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(g) CLAIMS BASED UPON RELIEF UNDER SECTION 722.&#151;If any part of an overpayment for a taxable year beginning prior to January 1, 1942, is determined by the Commissioner to be attributable to the final determination of an application for relief or benefit under section 722 for any taxable year, no interest shall be allowed or paid with respect to such part of the overpayment. If any part of an overpayment for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1941, is determined by the Commissioner to be attributable to the final determination of an application for relief or benefit under section 722 for any taxable year, no interest shall be allowed or paid with respect to such part of the overpayment for any period prior to one year after the filing of such application, or September 16, 1945, whichever is the later." 53 Stat. 465, as amended, 57 Stat. 602, 26 U. S. C. &#167; 3771 (g).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[16]  The same Act added I. R. C., &#167; 292 (b), containing comparable provisions prohibiting the assessment of interest upon deficiencies attributable to the final determination of an application for relief under &#167; 722. 53 Stat. 88, as amended, 57 Stat. 602, 26 U. S. C. &#167; 292 (b). This applied, for example, to deficiencies in the payment of ordinary income taxes resulting from an abatement under &#167; 722 of excess profits taxes. Such an abatement automatically would leave a larger portion of a corporation's taxable income subject to the normal income tax and surtax. This increase, however, was not made retroactive any more than the decrease in the excess profits tax which caused it was made retroactive. Congress thus appropriately charged no interest on the resulting deficiency just as it had allowed none on the related overpayment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[17]  When Congress, in a later Act, authorized deferment of payments of comparable taxes pending determinations of applications for relief, it did so unequivocally. The relief provisions in the Excess Profits Tax Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 1137, adding I. R. C., &#167;&#167; 430-472, prescribed formulas for determining a substitute average base period net income, &#167;&#167; 442-446, and permitted the taxpayer to adjust its base period net income at the time the return was filed, &#167; 447 (e). See S. Rep. No. 2679, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 17-21, discussing the general relationship between these provisions and the experience gained under &#167; 722 now before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[18]  See legislative history outlined in &lt;i&gt;American Coast Line&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 159 F. 2d 665, and &lt;i&gt;Pohatcong Hosiery Mills&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 162 F. 2d 146.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;". . . there is no doubt a difference between a tax, conceded to be due in the corporation's own return, and a tax assessed against it in invitum. This argument might perhaps be persuasive, if the denial of `benefits' under &#167; 722 were regarded as a constituent factor of the tax itself, as for example are the conditions detailed in &#167; 721. We do not so regard &#167; 722; on the contrary it was a favor; it presupposed that, even after taking into account the ameliatory conditions of &#167; 721, the tax was due unless ex gratia the blow was softened; it was a tempering of the wind to the shorn lamb." Circuit Judge Learned Hand, for the court, 159 F. 2d, at 668. See also, &lt;i&gt;Ideal Packing Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 9 T. C. 346, 349; &lt;i&gt;Uni-Term Stevedoring Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 3 T. C. 917, 918.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In each instance the section [722] provided that a hypothetical base period earnings credit be `tailor made' for the particular taxpayer and that certain assumptions be made in connection with the case. Each case was a problem in research, and the legal or tax result generally was intertwined with complicated accounting and economic problems. Almost every factor which had any influence on the particular business was pertinent to the case and the time and expense involved in reconstructing the average base period earnings credit were tremendous."

    &lt;p class="parties"&gt;Joe Valdez GONZALES, Petitioner,&lt;br&gt;v.&lt;br&gt;UNITED STATES of America.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="docket"&gt;No. 69.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="date"&gt;Argued Feb. 1, 2, 1955.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="date"&gt;Decided March 14, 1955.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="prelims"&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hayden C. Covington, Brooklyn, N.Y., for petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr.John F. Davis, Washington, D.C., for respondent.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Justice CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p1"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This is another prosecution under 62 Stat. 622, 50 U.S.C.App. &amp;#167; 462(a), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, &amp;#167; 462(a), for refusal to submit to induction into the armed services. The only question necessary to the decision of this case is whether petitioner claiming exemption because of conscientious objections to participation in war, was entitled to receive a copy of the recommendation made by the Department of Justice to the Appeal Board under the provisions of &amp;#167; 6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, 62 Stat. 612, as amended, 50 U.S.C.App. &amp;#167; 456(j), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, &amp;#167; 456(j). The trial judge held that he was not, and that the classification of petitioner as I&amp;#8212;A was valid. Petitioner was found guilty as charged, 120 F.Supp. 730, and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, 212 F.2d 71.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p2"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Petitioner registered under the selective service laws on January 4, 1950. In his classification questionnaire, filed on March 9, 1951, he claimed exemption as a minister and conscientious objector, his claims stemming from his association with the Jehovah's Witnesses. Under the doctrines of this sect, each member is a minister; and their tenets are widely interpreted as banning personal participation in political wars. See Sicurella v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xi8/sicurella-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;348&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;385&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 75 S.Ct. 403. Only petitioner's conscientious objector claim is now before the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p3"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Petitioner's secular education consisted of elementary school training and two years of high school. On September 27, 1948, he married a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses. The record indicates that, beginning in November 1949, he received 'private instruction' in the Bible from a member of the sect, and that in December he began 'actively serving' as a Jehovah's Witness. On January 4, 1950, petitioner registered under the selective service laws. The following month he was ordained as a minister of the Witnesses. Petitioner's religious affiliation, at least as late as 1948, had been Catholic, and his parents and family were Catholic. He began work with the Great Lakes Steel Corporation, a steel plant manufacturing articles of war, on August 19, 1950. On October 1, 1950, petitioner was recognized as a 'pioneer' by the Jehovah's Witnesses and embarked on more extensive religious activities.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p4"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In his special form for conscientious objectors, filed on April 3, 1951, petitioner claimed exemption from combatant and noncombatant service. He relied on 'the ten commandments of God found in the Bible' to support his claim. He said he would use force '(i)n protection of person and ministerial activities, but at no time in aggression.' Petitioner declined to rely on the official pronouncements of the Jehovah's Witnesses to support his position, stating that 'I am basing myself entirely on my knowledge of the Bible.' He supported his claims, however, with an affidavit signed by 22 persons, attesting to petitioner's activity in the Witnesses for the 18 months preceding April 8, 1951, and with a certificate of 4 persons stating that petitioner was conducting weekly Bible studies with them. Petitioner had not given public expression to his views 'other than' through his general religious activity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p5"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;After an intervening classification of III&amp;#8212;A (dependency deferment), petitioner was classified I&amp;#8212;A on January 8, 1952. On February 19, 1952, following a personal appearance, the local Board decided unanimously to continue petitioner in I&amp;#8212;A, and petitioner noted an appeal. The Appeal Board made a tentative finding against him and referred the case to the Department of Justice. The FBI then made its investigation and petitioner was given a hearing. The hearing officer, while noting that petitioner 'appeared to be a sincere Jehovah's Witness and as such is conscientiously opposed to war,' recommended denial of the conscientious objector classification. The Department of Justice, in its report to the Appeal Board, made a similar recommendation. In accepting the view expressed by the hearing officer, the Department found support in '(t)he fact that registrant became a member of the Jehovah's Witness sect one month after his Selective Service System registration in January, 1950, despite the fact that his wife had been a member for many years.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; No copy of this report or other notice of the recommendation was given petitioner prior to the Appeal Board's decision. On December 11, 1952, the Appeal Board unanimously classified petitioner I&amp;#8212;A, and upon his refusal to submit to induction this prosecution was brought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p6"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Petitioner contends that his classification is invalid because he was not furnished a copy of the Justice Department's recommendation to the Appeal Board and accorded an opportunity to reply thereto. Section 6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, outlining the procedure in conscientious objector cases, is silent on this question.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; But a similar silence was not held to be a considered rejection of the right of a registrant to be supplied with a fair re sume of adverse evidence in the FBI reports, United States v. Nugent, 1953, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xfM/united-states-v-nugent/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;346&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 73 S.Ct. 991, 97 L.Ed. 1417; Simmons v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xi9/simmons-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;348&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;397&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 75 S.Ct. 397, and we believe it also to be implicit in the Act and Regulations&amp;#8212;viewed against our underlying concepts of procedural regularity and basic fair play&amp;#8212;that a copy of the recommendation of the Department be furnished the registrant at the time it is forwarded to the Appeal Board, and that he be afforded an opportunity to reply.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p7"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It is true that the recommendation of the Department is advisory. 50 U.S.C.App. &amp;#167; 456(j), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, &amp;#167; 456(j). Indeed, this very consideration led us in United States v. Nugent, supra, to allow considerable latitude in the auxiliary hearing which culminated in the Department's report. A natural corollary of this, however, is that a registrant be given an opportunity to rebut this recommendation when it coames to the Appeal Board, the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification. For in the usual case it is the Appeal Board which renders the selective service determination considered 'final' in the courts, not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact. Estep v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wZ9/estep-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;327&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;114&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 66 S.Ct. 423, 90 L.Ed. 567.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p8"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It should be emphasized, moreover, that in contrast to the strictly appellate functions it exercises in other cases, the Appeal Board in handling conscientious objector claims is the first selective service board to receive the Department's recommendation, and is usually the only decision-making body to pass on the entire file. An opportunity for the registrant to reply is therefore the only means of insuring that this Board will have all of the relevant data. Furthermore, if the registrant is to present his case effectively to the Appeal Board, he must be cognizant of all the facts before the Board as well as the over-all position of the Department of Justice. See Ohio Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Utilities Comm., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wyP/ohio-bell-tel-co-v-public-utilities-commn/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;301&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;292&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 300&amp;#8212;305, 57 S.Ct. 724, 728&amp;#8212;730, 81 L.Ed. 1093; United States v. Abilene &amp;amp; So. Ry. Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/vRJ/united-states-v-abilene-so-ry-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;265&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;274&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 289, 44 S.Ct. 565, 569, 68 L.Ed. 1016; Interstate Commerce Comm. v. Louisville &amp;amp; N.R. Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/v4w/int-com-comm-v-louis-nash-rr/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;227&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;88&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 93, 33 S.Ct. 185, 187, 57 L.Ed. 431.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p9"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The facts here underscore this necessity. The Department in its recommendation emphasizes that the petitioner was of a Catholic family and concluded that petitioner's 'affiliation with (Jehovah's Witnesses) has been too recent and too closely related to his draft status to warrant the acceptance of his conscientious objector position as genuine. The fact that registrant became a member of the Jehovah's Witness sect one month after his * * * registration * * * lends weight to this conclusion.' But petitioner contends he was a member of the Witnesses before he registered, and there is testimony that he had not been of the Catholic belief since 1948. Nor was this facet of the case explored at the Department of Justice hearing. If petitioner had been afforded a copy of the recommendation, he might have successfully contradicted the basis of he Department's conclusion or diminished the forcefulness of its thrust. The record also discloses that the local Board apparently placed little emphasis on the lateness of petitioner's conversion, inquiring instead about the tenets of the sect and petitioner's employment in the steel plant. On appeal, it was logical for petitioner to direct his attention to these matters. But the Department of Justice based its rejection of his claim on the proximity of petitioner's conversion to his registration for the draft, a contention of which he had no knowledge and no opportunity to meet. The petitioner was entitled to know the thrust of the Department's recommendation so he could muster his facts and arguments to meet its contentions. See Morgan v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wBZ/morgan-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;304&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 18,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="fn5_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; 58 S.Ct. 773, 776, 82 L.Ed. 1129.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p10"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Nor is this requirement inconsistent with the views expressed in United States v. Nugent, supra, (&lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xfM/united-states-v-nugent/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;346&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 73 S.Ct. 996), that selective service procedures, 'geared to meet the imperative needs of mobilization and national vigilance', are not to be delayed by 'litigious interruption.' The registrant in that case sought to make the auxiliary procedure of the Department of Justice 'a full-scale trial for each appealing registrant.' We refuse to compel 'an all-out collateral attack at the (Department of Justice) hearing on the testimony obtained in its prehearing investigation.' Here all that is involved is the mailing of a copy of the Department's recommendation to the registrant and permitting a reply to the Appeal Board. The registrant already has the right to file a statement with the Appeal Board.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6" id="fn6_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; Just as the right to a hearing means the right to a meaningful hearing, United States v. Nugent, supra; Simmons v. United States, supra, so the right to file a statement before the Appeal Board includes the right to file a meaningful statement, one based on all the facts in the file and made with awareness of the recommendations and arguments to be countered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p11"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;A similar problem has arisen once before in the administration of our selective service laws. Under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, &amp;#167; 301 et seq., local Boards referred to panels of clergymen and laymen of a particular faith questions concerning the validity of ministerial and divinity student claims. The panel interviewed the registrant and made a report to the local Board. In sustaining the use of these panels, this Court emphasized the right of the registrant under the regulations to examine the report and 'explain or correct it, or deny it.' Eagles v. United States ex rel. Samuels, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x21/eagles-v-united-states-ex-rel-samuels/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;329&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;304&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 313, 67 S.Ct. 313, 318, 91 L.Ed. 308. See also Eagles v. United States ex rel. Horowitz, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x22/eagles-v-united-states-ex-rel-horowitz/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;329&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;317&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 323, 67 S.Ct. 320, 324, 91 L.Ed. 318. And, in a case where it was not shown that the registrant had access to the panel's report, Judge Learned Hand said:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'As the case comes to us, the board made use of evidence of      which (the registrant) may have been unaware, and which he      had no chance to answer: a prime requirement of any fair      hearing.' United States v. Balogh, 2 Cir., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca2/8ATH/united-states-v-balogh/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;157&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;939&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 943,      judgment vacated on other grounds, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;329&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;692&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 67 S.Ct.      625, 91 L.Ed. 605.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;See also Brewer v. United States, 4 Cir., 1954, 211 F.2d 864.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p14"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;So basic, indeed, is this 'prime requirement of any fair hearing' that counsel for the Government contended for the first time in oral argument that the rights of the registrant were amply protected by the provision in the regulations for a mode of 'rehearing.' In short, the argument is that after the Appeal Board decides against the registrant and his file is returned to the local Board, he has the right under the selective service regulations to examine all information in his file, including the recommendation of the Department, 32 CFR &amp;#167; 1606.32(a)(1); 32 CFR &amp;#167; 1606.38(c). The registrant would then have a right to request a reopening of his classification, 32 CFR &amp;#167; 1625.1(a); 32 CFR &amp;#167; 1625.2, if he submitted 'proof of error in documents submitted to the appeal board by the Department of Justice.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn7" id="fn7_ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; Moreover, he may present his contentions to the Director of Selective Service or the State Director of Selective Service, requesting a reopening of his classification or a reconsideration by the Appeal Board, 32 CFR &amp;#167; 1625.3(a); 32 CFR &amp;#167; 1626.61(a).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p15"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;We believe these remedies to be too little and too late. Too little, because the right to present petitioner's side of the case is broader than the bare right to correct 'errors' made by the Department in its recommendation. Too late, because, except with the permission of the national or state Director, only the local Board may reopen the case; and a certain reluctance is to be expected after the Appeal Board, albeit on incomplete presentation, has rejected the registrant's claim. Moreover, the local Board has discretion to refuse to reopen the case if it 'is of the opinion that the information accompanying such request fails to present any facts in addition to those considered when the registrant was classified or, even if new facts are presented, the local board is of the opinion that such facts, if true, would not justify a change in such registrant's classification. * * *' 32 CFR &amp;#167; 16&amp;#8212;25.4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p16"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;We hold that the over all procedures set up in the statute and regulations, designed to be 'fair and just' in their operation, 62 Stat. 605, 50 U.S.C.App. &amp;#167; 451(c), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, &amp;#167; 451(c), require that the registrant receive a copy of the Justice Department's recommendation and be given a reasonable opportunity to file a reply thereto. Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals, upholding petitioner's conviction for refusing to submit to induction, is reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p17"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;I would affirm. The prescribed procedure, including especially the hearing before a hearing officer, provided adequate protection for petitioner, and I find no express or implied statutory or administrative requirement that the Department of Justice send to petitioner a copy of its advisory report to the Appeal Board.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The report of the Department of Justice is advisory only. As the registrant has, under Selective Service Regulations, 32 CFR &amp;#167; 1606.32(a)(1), a right to examine the report, as well as all other information in the file, and under &amp;#167; 1625(1) and (2) reopen the classification on a showing of error, the 'fair and just' requirement for a hearing is satisfied.

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Because the regulations of the Board did not require the Department of Justice to send petitioner a copy of its advisory report, and since the petitioner did not request that he be allowed to see the report or a summary thereof, the action of the Board was not arbitrary and capricious. The Board did not lose its jurisdiction or act beyond it. I would affirm.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; A much more extensive narration of petitioner's background is given in the hearing officer's report. (R. 11a et seq.) The latter document, under applicable regulations, 32 CFR (1954 Supp.) &amp;#167; 1626.25, was not transmitted to the Appeal Board for its consideration in classifying petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The complete text of the report is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Registrant was born July 22, 1931, in San Antonio, Texas. He left the Edison High School of that city in June, 1948, after two years of attendance and took employment as a sheet metal worker with a local firm. He married his present wife in September, 1948. In the summer of 1949 he came to Detroit and worked as a laborer for the Adams Lumber Company until July, 1950. From August, 1950 to present he has been employed as a laborer and general maintenance man at the Great Lakes Steel Corporation. Registrant previously was a Catholic and has five sisters and a brother all of whom are Catholics. His parents were Catholics. His mother is dead and his father lives in San Antonio, Texas. Registrant's wife became a Jehovah's Witness in 1941 and registrant was baptized a member in February, 1950. In October, 1950, he became a 'pioneer' and he participates in the usual activities of his sect, attending several weekly meetings including the Theocratic Ministry School. He also does house to house work and sells the publications of the sect. Registrant bases his claim for exemption upon his own personal interpretation of the Bible with the guidance of the Watchtower Bible aids and relies particularly on the Ten Commandments. He believes in the use of force in self defense.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'The investigation reflects that registrant is well regarded in the several communities in which he has lived and that he and his wife are said to be very religious. Neighbors advise that they hold Bible studies in their apartment and appear to devote considerable time to religious work. References and co-religionists state that he is a devoted member of the sect and applies himself earnestly to his religious work. Employment records reveal that registrant was remembered as a good worker and that his record is good and contains no derogatory information.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'After a personal appearance, the Hearing Officer stated that registrant appeared to be a sincere Jehovah's Witness but concluded that his affiliation with that sect has been too recent and too closely related to his draft status to warrant the acceptance of his conscientious objector position as genuine. The fact that registrant became a member of the Jehovah's Witness sect one month after his Selective Service System registration in January, 1950, despite the fact that his wife had been a member for many years, lends weight to this conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'After consideration of the entire file and record, the Department of Justice finds that the registrant's objections to combatant and noncombatant service are not sustained. It is, therefore, recommended to your Board that registrant's claim for exemption from both combatant and noncombatant training and service be not sustained.'&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn3"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; This section does provide that the Department of Justice shall make an 'appropriate inquiry,' and hold a 'hearing' with respect to the claimed conscientious objections. If after such hearing it finds the claims unfounded, 'it shall recommend to the appeal board that such objections be not sustained.' The regulations are of the same tenor, 32 CFR (1954 Supp.) &amp;#167; 1626.25.&lt;/p&gt;

The latter three cases are distinguishable, moreover, because they do not involve individualized fact finding and classification, but legislative determinations, political judgments, and the exercise of judicial discretion in the imposition of sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; 'The right to a hearing embraces not only the right to present evidence, but also a reasonable opportunity to know the claims of the opposing party and to meet them. The right to submit argument implies that opportunity; otherwise the right may be but a barren one. Those who are brought into contest with the Government in a quasi-judicial proceeding aimed at the control of their activities are entitled to be fairly advised of what the Government proposes and to be heard upon its proposals before it issues its final command.'&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; See 32 CFR &amp;#167; 1626.12. 'The person appealing may attach to his appeal a statement specifying the matters in which he believes the local board erred, may direct attention to any information in the registrant's file which he believes the local board has failed to consider or to give sufficient weight, and may set out in full any information which was offered to the local board and which the local board failed or refused to include in the registrant's file.' It is true that this section requires that the statements be made at the time the appeal is initiated. And 32 CFR &amp;#167; 1626.24(b) provides that 'the appeal board shall not receive or consider any information which is not contained in the record received from the local board except (1) the advisory recommendation from the Department of Justice under &amp;#167; 1626.25, and (2) general information concerning economic, industrial, and social conditions.' But the broad scope of review provided in &amp;#167; 1626.12 is inconsistent with any implication that registrants in conscientious objector cases are required to file their statements with the initial appeal. Such a requirement, if indeed the section is viewed as an absolute bar to supplemental and amendatory statements, may be proper in the normal case. But where the record is augmented on appeal, the registrant can effectively point out error and failure to consider only after the Department of Justice has acted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Argued February 3, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided March 14, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Walter E. Gallagher&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Myron G. Ehrlich.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beatrice Rosenberg&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With her on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Marvin E. Frankel&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Joseph A. Barry.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE MINTON delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An information was filed in the Municipal Court of the District of Columbia charging the petitioner with violation of 26 U. S. C. &#167; 3290 in that he engaged in the business of accepting wagers without paying the occupational tax imposed by that section. The Municipal Court sustained &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*420&lt;/span&gt; a motion to dismiss the information. The Municipal Court of Appeals for the District reversed, 100 A. 2d 40, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Municipal Court of Appeals. 94 U. S. App. D. C. ___, 214 F. 2d 853. We granted certiorari. 348 U. S. 810.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions presented in this case are: Does the Act, as applied to the petitioner in the District of Columbia, constitute a valid exercise of the taxing power or is it a penalty under the guise of a tax? Secondly, does it violate the Fifth Amendment's prohibition as to compulsory self-incrimination? Thirdly, does it contravene the Fourth Amendment's ban against unreasonable search and seizure? The first two questions were categorically answered in the negative, and the validity and constitutionality of the Act upheld by us in &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kahriger,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 22; the third question is not substantially different from the second and is also controlled by &lt;i&gt;Kahriger.&lt;/i&gt; The only material factual difference between that case and the instant case is that in &lt;i&gt;Kahriger&lt;/i&gt; the violation occurred in a State, namely, Pennsylvania, while in the instant case the violation is charged to have taken place in the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statute, 26 U. S. C. &#167; 3290, provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A special tax of $50 per year shall be paid by each person who is liable for tax under subchapter A or who is engaged in receiving wagers for or on behalf of any person so liable."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another section, 26 U. S. C. &#167; 3271, reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Payment of tax&#151;(a) Condition precedent to doing business.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"No person shall be engaged in or carry on any trade or business mentioned in this chapter until he has paid a special tax therefor in the manner provided in this chapter."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*421&lt;/span&gt; Subchapter A, referred to in &#167; 3290, provides in &#167; 3285:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(a) Wagers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There shall be imposed on wagers, as defined in subsection (b), an excise tax equal to 10 per centum of the amount thereof."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These provisions must be read together, and when we do, it seems clear that payment of the special $50 tax is to be made prior to engaging in the business of accepting wagers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We held in &lt;i&gt;Kahriger&lt;/i&gt; that this statute was a constitutional exercise of the taxing power and was not a penalty under the guise of a tax. 345 U. S., at 24-32. It is argued that that case involved wagering in a State, where such activity is not a violation of federal law, that the instant case arises in the District of Columbia, where wagering is by federal law a crime, D. C. Code, 1951, &#167; 22-1501 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; and that this statute as applied to petitioner in the District of Columbia is a penalty in the guise of a tax. The short answer to this argument is that this Court has long held that the Federal Government may tax what it also forbids. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Stafoff,&lt;/i&gt; 260 U. S. 477.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it is contended by petitioner that the Act in question is unconstitutional because compliance compels self-incrimination in contravention of the Fifth Amendment. The Fifth Amendment provides that one cannot be &lt;i&gt;compelled,&lt;/i&gt; in a criminal case, to be a witness against himself. It is a shield that prevents one from being convicted out of his own mouth by anything short of voluntary statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner maintains that the taxes imposed are retrospective in application. It is argued that he must be liable for the tax under subchapter A in the sense that he must have already wagered before he is required to take out the occupational tax, and that to require him to do so &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*422&lt;/span&gt; compels admission that he has gambled. We do not so read the statute. The Act does not mean one must first have made a wager as defined in subchapter A and therefore incurred liability to pay the tax levied therein before liability for the occupational tax attaches. The Act is wholly prospective and by its terms did not become applicable until November 1, 1951, more than ten days after its enactment on October 20, 1951. See compiler's note to 26 U. S. C. &#167; 3285. The statute simply designates a class that &lt;i&gt;is liable&lt;/i&gt; to pay the ten percent tax when a wager or wagers are made. Payment of the $50 tax here under consideration is a registration fee that must be paid before engaging in the business of wagering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We said in &lt;i&gt;Kahriger, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 32-33: "Under the registration provisions of the wagering tax, appellee is not compelled to confess to acts already committed, he is merely informed by the statute that in order to engage in the business of wagering in the future he must fulfill certain conditions." The condition here important was that petitioner must first pay the $50 tax, but that did not give him any license to engage in an unlawful business. &lt;i&gt;License Tax Cases,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;462&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 471. It only warned that if he proposed to carry on this particular business he must pay the tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If petitioner desires to engage in an unlawful business, he does so only on his own volition. The fact that he may elect to pay the tax and make the prescribed disclosures required by the Act is a matter of his choice. There is nothing compulsory about it, and, consequently, there is nothing violative of the Fifth Amendment. If he does not pay the occupational tax, proceeds to accept wagers, and is prosecuted therefor, as in this case, he cannot be compelled to testify and may claim his privilege. The only compulsion under the Act is that requiring the decision which would-be gamblers must make at the threshold. They may have to give up gambling, but &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*423&lt;/span&gt; there is no constitutional right to gamble. If they elect to wager, though it be unlawful, they must pay the tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, finally, the petitioner argues that to require him to pay the tax and exhibit the stamp in his place of business, as required by 26 U. S. C. &#167; 3293 of the Act, is to furnish probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant. This is just another facet of the Fifth Amendment argument, but the ready answer is that the petitioner has no stamp. If he does not purchase a stamp even though he wagers, which is this case, it is difficult to see how such failure would give probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant. His complaint is that if he had one he might get in trouble. Since petitioner is without a stamp, he is not in a position to raise the question as to what might happen to him if he had one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kahriger,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 22, put a most restrictive interpretation on the Fifth Amendment's provision against compelling persons to confess facts which will help government take away their liberty. But this case reduces the Fifth Amendment's protection still more. Kahriger had to confess only to state law violations to save himself from going to jail for violating the federal registration law. This was one of the arguments relied on by the Government to persuade this Court to sustain the federal law as applied to Kahriger.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; But the petitioner &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*424&lt;/span&gt; here, in order to be permitted to pay the $50 tax, must file a written confession with the District of Columbia Internal Revenue Collector revealing that, in violation of federal law, he is at the moment he registers "engaged in the business of accepting wagers."&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; He must also tell where he carries on the illegal business, the names and addresses of those who receive wagers for him and of those for whom he receives wagers.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; For engaging in this wagering business, which registration would compel petitioner to confess, he could be convicted of felony, fined $1,000, imprisoned three years, or both.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; And for conspiring with his employers or employees to promote a lottery even in the future, which compulsory registration is designed to reveal, petitioner could be punished by a fine of $10,000, imprisonment for five years, or both.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; Thus in order to pay the tax, petitioner would be &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*425&lt;/span&gt; compelled to supply evidence useful and maybe sufficient to convict him of felonies for which he could be incarcerated for years. If this would not violate the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination, it is hard to think of anything that would. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Blau&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 340 U. S. 159, and cases cited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet the Court holds petitioner can be sent to jail for refusal to make a public registration of his guilt of criminal conduct. This result seems to be largely dependent on the statement that petitioner has "no constitutional right to gamble." Of course not. But if we remain faithful to the letter and spirit of the Bill of Rights, gamblers, like others, have a right to invoke its safeguards. It should not be forgotten that breaches opened to get lawless gamblers remain to jeopardize the liberty of the law-abiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In view of the recentness of the decision in &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kahriger,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 22, and my continuing disagreement with the constitutional views which it expressed, I cannot acquiesce in this decision. Indeed, this case only emphasizes the difficulties which I found in &lt;i&gt;Kahriger,&lt;/i&gt; for here we are concerned with a spurious use of the taxing power as a means of facilitating prosecution of federal offenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The Government there argued: "Wagering is doubtless unlawful in many states (perhaps in all but Nevada), but it is not forbidden by any federal law.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Thus the registration statement in which the taxpayer is required to set forth his name, address and places of business, and the names and addresses of his agents or principals does not call for a disclosure of information which will reveal a violation of federal law." Reply Brief for the United States, p. 3, &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kahriger,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 22.&lt;/p&gt;

Paragraph 4 of Instructions on the tax return which petitioner would have been compelled to sign in order to pay the $50 tax provides: "The information called for on the return must be completely furnished. If not so furnished, the special tax stamp will not be issued."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  That petitioner would have been compelled to make such confessions is shown by a copy of the "Special Tax Return and Application for Registry&#151;Wagering" in effect at the time of petitioner's failure to register. It reads in part: "5. Are you engaged in the business of accepting wagers on your own account? . . . If yes, [give] (&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;) Name and address where each such business is conducted. . . . (&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;) Number of employees and/or agents engaged in receiving wagers on your behalf. . . . (&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;) True name, current address, and special tax stamp number of each such person. . . . 6. Do you receive wagers for or on behalf of some other person or persons? . . . If yes, give true name and address of each such person. . . ."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  The D. C. Code, 1951, &#167; 22-1501 makes promotion of lotteries a crime. The definition of lotteries here includes the definition of wagers in the registration law. 65 Stat. 529, 26 U. S. C. &#167; 3285.&lt;/p&gt;

v.&lt;br&gt;
COLORADO INTERSTATE GAS CO.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;No. 45.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued January 31, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided March 28, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*493&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Assistant Attorney General Burger&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Melvin Richter, Willard W. Gatchell, Lambert McAllister&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Jacob Goldberg.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;James Lawrence White&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;William A. Dougherty, John P. Akolt, Sr., John R. Turnquist, Charles E. McGee&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lewis M. Poe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principal question before us is whether, on a petition to review a natural gas rate reduction order of the Federal Power Commission, a Court of Appeals may consider, &lt;i&gt;sua sponte,&lt;/i&gt; an objection which has not been urged before the Commission in the application for rehearing prescribed by &#167; 19 of the Natural Gas Act.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Alternatively, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*494&lt;/span&gt; a question also is raised whether, in such a rate proceeding, a Court of Appeals may invalidate, &lt;i&gt;sua sponte,&lt;/i&gt; an existing order of the Commission, which prohibits the inclusion of certain operating expenses of the natural gas company in its cost of service, where such order not only has been proposed and acquiesced in by the company, but has been imposed on it by the Commission as a condition of a merger under which the company is operating. For the reasons hereafter stated, we answer each of these questions in the negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1948, the Federal Power Commission, petitioner herein, instituted a rate investigation against respondent, the Colorado Interstate Gas Company, under &#167; 5 (a) of the Natural Gas Act, 52 Stat. 823-824, 15 U. S. C. &#167; 717d (a). While this was pending, respondent and the Canadian River Gas Company filed a joint application under &#167; 7 of the same Act, 52 Stat. 824-825, as amended, 15 U. S. C. &#167; 717f. That application sought a certificate of public convenience and necessity permitting respondent to merge with the latter company, acquire and operate its properties, and construct additional facilities. Objection was made that consumers, receiving natural gas from respondent, might be forced by this merger to share respondent's loss if the costs of certain gasoline operations to be undertaken by it exceeded its revenues from them. To meet this objection, respondent proposed that the Commission, in any natural gas rate proceeding, exclude such loss from the company's cost of service.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 1, 1951, the Commission wrote in the above proposal as a condition of its certification of the merger. 10 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*495&lt;/span&gt; F. P. C. 105, 778.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; No review was sought. The merger was consummated and respondent has enjoyed its benefits since December 31, 1951.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rate investigation was resumed in 1951 and the year 1952 became the test year. The usual intermediate decision was omitted and, on August 8, 1952, the Commission issued its findings and rate order. 95 P. U. R. (N. S.) 97. In that proceeding, respondent had argued for a "volumetric" allocation of gasoline costs which, in 1952, would result in a showing of no loss suffered by it from the gasoline operations in question. The Commission, however, had declined to adopt that method and had applied a "relative market value method" of allocating costs. This showed a loss of $421,537 from such operations and, pursuant to its merger order, the Commission held that such loss "shall not be considered as a part of the cost of service which we have heretofore determined." On that basis, the Commission found respondent's total cost of service, in 1952, to be $14,952,567, including federal taxes of $185,599 and the proceeds of a 5.75% rate of return ($3,280,317 on a rate base of $57,048,988). Deducting &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*496&lt;/span&gt; that cost from its gas service revenues of $17,962,532 left respondent with excess revenues of over $3,000,000. The Commission accordingly ordered a rate reduction eliminating that excess. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 127.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent applied for a rehearing pursuant to &#167; 19 (a) of the Natural Gas Act. The application stated respondent's objections to the Commission's allocation of the expense of the gasoline operations and a claim that, if the costs were properly allocated, there would be no resulting loss. Respondent complained further that the Commission's computation, in effect, reduced the company's rate of return from 5.75% to 5.01%. At no point did respondent contend that the Commission's order excluding respondent's loss from gasoline operations from its cost of service was invalid. Upon consideration of the application, the Commission denied the rehearing and modified the new rates only to a slight degree not material here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On respondent's petition for review by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, that court generally upheld the Commission's findings and order. It accepted the Commission's method of allocating respondent's gasoline costs and the computation which fixed the resulting loss at $421,537. However, the court held, &lt;i&gt;sua sponte,&lt;/i&gt; that, despite the action taken in the merger proceeding, this loss must be added to respondent's cost of service. The court therefore reversed the Commission's order and remanded the cause for further proceedings. 209 F. 2d 717. After reargument, the court reaffirmed its position. 209 F. 2d 732. Recognizing the importance of such a result in relation to the judicial review of administrative orders, we granted the Commission's petition for certiorari but denied respondent's cross-petition. 347 U. S. 1009; 348 U. S. 818, 884. 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1254 (1); 52 Stat. 831-832, 15 U. S. C. &#167; 717r (b).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*497&lt;/span&gt; The Natural Gas Act prescribes explicitly the procedure to be followed by any person seeking judicial review of an order of the Federal Power Commission, and limits the scope of that review as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"SEC. 19. (a) Any person . . . aggrieved by an order issued by the [Federal Power] Commission in a proceeding under this Act to which such person. . . is a party may apply for a rehearing within thirty days after the issuance of such order. The application for rehearing shall set forth &lt;i&gt;specifically&lt;/i&gt; the ground or grounds upon which such application is based. . . . &lt;i&gt;No proceeding to review any order of the Commission shall be brought by any person unless such person shall have made application to the Commission for a rehearing thereon.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(b) . . . &lt;i&gt;No objection to the order of the Commission shall be considered by the court&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;of Appeals&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;i&gt;unless such objection shall have been urged before the Commission in the application for rehearing unless there is reasonable ground for failure so to do.&lt;/i&gt; . . ." (Emphasis supplied.) 52 Stat. 831-832, 15 U. S. C. &#167; 717r (a) and (b).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent first contends that its application for a rehearing by the Commission did, in substance, object to the validity of the merger condition and thus did meet the requirements of &#167; 19 (b). We find, however, that in such application, respondent objected to the exclusion of the loss of $421,537 from gasoline operations merely on the ground that the Commission's certificate approving the merger required a "proper allocation" of the costs, and that the method of allocation chosen by the Commission was not "proper." Respondent also unsuccessfully proposed an alternative method of allocation, which would eliminate the loss. In passing upon these contentions, the Commission assumed, as did respondent, that any properly &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*498&lt;/span&gt; computed loss resulting from the gasoline operations was to be excluded from the cost of service. Respondent's objection thus gave no notice that respondent was attacking the validity of the merger condition. The same is true of respondent's objection to the Commission's treatment of its income taxes, and of respondent's claim that the ultimate effect of the Commission's order was to reduce its net share of the proceeds of the rate of return from one of 5.75% to one of 5.01%. These were bids for a higher rate of return or for a recomputation of the loss from the gasoline operations, not claims that the merger condition was invalid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent's second and principal contention is that, although its application did not meet the requirements of &#167; 19 (b) and &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; therefore is barred from attacking the validity of the merger condition in the Court of Appeals, nothing precludes that court itself from raising, considering and sustaining the same objection, &lt;i&gt;sua sponte.&lt;/i&gt; Respondent's error appears on the face of the statute. Section 19 (a) first precludes the &lt;i&gt;bringing&lt;/i&gt; of any proceeding in a Court of Appeals to review an order of the Commission, &lt;i&gt;unless the person bringing it previously has applied to the Commission for a rehearing on that order.&lt;/i&gt; Section 19 (b) then expressly precludes the &lt;i&gt;consideration&lt;/i&gt; by the court of any objection to an order of the Commission, &lt;i&gt;unless the objection shall have been urged before the Commission in the application for rehearing.&lt;/i&gt; As the court is thus expressly &lt;i&gt;precluded from considering&lt;/i&gt; an objection when, without prior application to the Commission, that objection is presented to the court by the party directly aggrieved,&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; it cannot be assumed that Congress intended to &lt;i&gt;permit&lt;/i&gt; the same court to consider the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*499&lt;/span&gt; same objection, under the same circumstances, &lt;i&gt;sua sponte,&lt;/i&gt; merely because the objection was &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; presented to the court by the party aggrieved. Section 19 (b) reflects the policy that a party must exhaust its administrative remedies before seeking judicial review. To allow a Court of Appeals to intervene here on its own motion would seriously undermine the purpose of the explicit requirements of &#167; 19 (b) that objections must first come before the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 10 (e) of the Administrative Procedure Act does not require a different result.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; That Act purports to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*500&lt;/span&gt; strengthen, rather than to weaken, the principle requiring the exhaustion of administrative remedies before permitting court review. The Senate Committee, recommending the bill for that Act, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A party cannot wilfully fail to exhaust his administrative remedies and then, after the agency action has become operative, either secure a suspension of the agency action by a belated appeal to the agency, &lt;i&gt;or resort to court without having given the agency an opportunity to determine the questions raised. If he so fails he is precluded from judicial review by the application of the time-honored doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.&lt;/i&gt; . . ." (Emphasis supplied.) S. Doc. No. 248, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. 289, n. 21.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, &#167; 10, by its own terms, is made inapplicable in "so far as (1) statutes [as here] preclude judicial review," and &#167; 10 (e) applies only to situations where the question at issue has been properly "presented," as has not been done here. It is not a reasonable interpretation of the general terms of that Act to hold that they repeal the administrative procedures specifically set forth in the Natural Gas Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We have recognized in more than a few decisions, and Congress has recognized in more than a few statutes, that orderly procedure and good administration require that objections to the proceedings of an administrative agency be made while it has opportunity for correction in order to raise issues reviewable by the courts." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tucker Truck Lines,&lt;/i&gt; 344 U. S. 33, 36-37. See also, &lt;i&gt;Riss &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 341 U. S. 907; &lt;i&gt;Wong Yang Sung&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McGrath,&lt;/i&gt; 339 U. S. 33; &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Capital Transit Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 338 U. S. 286, 291; &lt;i&gt;Unemployment Compensation Commission&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Aragon,&lt;/i&gt; 329 U. S. 143, 155.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*501&lt;/span&gt; The necessity for prior administrative consideration of an issue is apparent where, as here, its decision calls for the application of technical knowledge and experience not usually possessed by judges. The Federal Power Commission is an administrative agency the decisions of which involve those difficult problems of policy, accounting, economics and special knowledge that go into public utility rate making. For reviewing a rate made by the Federal Power Commission, the Court of Appeals has no inherent suitability comparable to that which it has for reviewing the judicial decisions made by a United States District Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent further suggests that to limit the judicial review of the Court of Appeals to those objections which have been urged specifically before the Commission prevents that court from reviewing effectively the "end result" of the rate order. See &lt;i&gt;Federal Power Commission&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hope Natural Gas Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 320 U. S. 591. To accept that argument would wipe out at a single stroke the expressly prescribed policy of &#167; 19 (b). Not only would such acceptance be contrary to the terms of the statute, but it would fail to recognize the fundamental consideration that it is not the function of a court itself to engage in rate making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the language of &#167; 19, we hold that the Court of Appeals does not here have authority, either under &#167; 19 or &lt;i&gt;sua sponte,&lt;/i&gt; to reverse the Commission by overruling its exclusion of $421,537 of gasoline production expense from respondent's cost of service for rate purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative ground for reversal, the Commission also contends that the Court of Appeals is here precluded from redetermining the validity of the merger condition because of respondent's and the Commission's previous conduct in approving it. Cf. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hancock Truck Lines,&lt;/i&gt; 324 U. S. 774, 778-780. In 1950, respondent proposed this condition in its merger proceeding. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*502&lt;/span&gt; That merger had many facets and a difference of opinion existed within the Commission on its merits. 10 F. P. C. 105, 119. In 1951, the condition before us became an important factor in securing the Commission's finding that the merger would be in the public interest. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 780. After the merger was approved on that condition, respondent sought no review of it. On the other hand, respondent consummated the merger and has enjoyed its benefits ever since. It cannot now be allowed to attack an officially approved condition of the merger while retaining at the same time all of its benefits. The impropriety of the attack is rendered twofold because it is not made in the merger proceeding but is attempted in a separate rate proceeding. While respondent also charges that, under the Commission's allocation of gasoline costs and the condition requiring the company to absorb them, the rate of return is reduced from 5.75% to 5.01% and is therefore unreasonable and confiscatory, we do not sustain that charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Court of Appeals accordingly is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  52 Stat. 831-832, as amended, 15 U. S. C. &#167; 717r. The material provisions of &#167; 19 (a) and (b) are set forth in the body of this opinion at p. 497,&lt;i&gt;infra.&lt;/i&gt; For related litigation not material to the issues now presented, see &lt;i&gt;Colorado Interstate Gas Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Federal Power Commission,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Canadian River Gas Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Federal Power Commission,&lt;/i&gt; 324 U. S. 581, and &lt;i&gt;Colorado-Wyoming Gas Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Federal Power Commission,&lt;/i&gt; 324 U. S. 626.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The proposal in respondent's latter of June 8, 1950, to the Commission, was that "in order to keep a rate payer from meeting this deficiency the Commission could condition the certificate of public convenience and necessity so as in effect to provide that such deficit would not be considered in determining reasonable rates. In other words, the stockholders of Colorado Interstate Gas Company would take the risk as to whether or not gasoline prices will go down."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  "(i) The authorization herein granted for effectuating the acquisition and operation of Canadian's properties and facilities is upon the express understanding and condition that if, as a result of carrying out the terms and conditions in the transaction proposed as a part of the acquisition and merger of Canadian into Colorado whereby rights to liquid hydrocarbons in place are granted to Southwestern Development Co. and whereby Colorado is to receive 50 percent of the gross proceeds from the sale of certain liquid hydrocarbons and 15 percent of the net revenue to be received by Colorado from the hydrocarbons resulting from the operation of Fairish Natural Gasoline Plant of Texoma Natural Gas Co., the costs properly allowable to such hydrocarbons exceed the amounts payable to Colorado pursuant to such transaction, &lt;i&gt;then and in that case in any proceeding in which the effective or proposed rates of Colorado are under inquiry such excess shall not be considered as a cost of service to Colorado's natural gas customers and consumers.&lt;/i&gt;" (Emphasis supplied.) 10 F. P. C., at 780.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  ". . . Petitioner moreover, failed to object in its application for rehearing before the Commission to the inclusion of its producing properties and gathering facilities in the rate base. It is accordingly precluded by &#167; 19 (b) of the Act from attacking the order of the Commission on the ground that they are included." &lt;i&gt;Panhandle Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Federal Power Commission,&lt;/i&gt; 344 U. S. 635, 649, and see 650-651. See also, &lt;i&gt;Labor Board&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cheney Lumber Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 327 U.

S. 344, where failure to preserve the issue by objection before the agency was treated as a bar to the judicial consideration of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  "SEC. 10. &lt;i&gt;Except so far as&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;statutes preclude judicial review&lt;/i&gt; or (2) agency action is by law committed to agency discretion&#151;

It shall (A) compel agency unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed; and (B) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be (1) arbitrary, capricious,an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege or immunity; (3) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; (4) without observance of procedure required by law; (5) unsupported by substantial evidence in any case subject to the requirement of sections 7 and 8 or otherwise reviewed on the record of an agency hearing provided by statute; or (6) unwarranted by the facts to the extent that the facts are subject to trial de novo by the reviewing court. In making the foregoing determinations the court shall review the whole record or such portions therefore as may be cited by any part, and due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error."

    &lt;p class="parties"&gt;Lloyd WEBER et al., Petitioners,&lt;br&gt;v.&lt;br&gt;ANHEUSER-BUSCH, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="docket"&gt;No. 97.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="date"&gt;Argued Feb. 2 and 3, 1955.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="date"&gt;Decided March 28, 1955.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="prelims"&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr.Robert A. Roessel, St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. David E. Feller, Washington, D.C., for C.I.O. amicus curiae.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Mark D. Eagleton, St. Louis, Mo., for respondent.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p1"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This case grew out of a dispute between petitioner, the International Association of Machinists (IAM), affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, and the Millwrights, affiliated with the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners (Carpenters), which in turn was affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, over millwright work being performed for respondent, each union claiming the work for its own members.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p2"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Respondent is engaged in the interstate manufacture and sale of beer and other commodities, with its principal place of business in St. Louis, Missouri. Its employees include members of both the IAM and the Carpenters. Respondent has always required a large amount of millwright work to be performed by outside contractors in the expansion of its facilities. After the IAM was certified in 1948 by the National Labor Relations Board as the exclusive bargaining representative of respondent's machinists, respondent executed a collective bargaining contract with the IAM for 1949 which provided in part that when the repair or replacement of machinery was necessary, this work would be given only to those contractors who had collective agreements with the IAM. As a result of protests from the Carpenters, who claimed the same type of work for their own members, the clause was deleted from the 1950 contract between respondent and the IAM, but it was later reinstated in the 1951 contract. The Carpenters again protested, this time threatening that they would sign no contract with respondent covering those employees who were members of the Carpenters until the clause was deleted from the IAM contract. When the 1951 IAM contract expired and negotiations for a 1952 contract began, respondent refused to agree to the insertion of the clause in the new contract. An impasse was reached in the negotiations, and finally the IAM went on strike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p3"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;At the time the strike was called, only one contractor was actually engaged in respondent's millwright work, and the employees of that one contractor were covered by a contract with the IAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p4"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;On April 8, 1952, the day after the strike was called, respondent filed a charge of an unfair labor practice under &amp;#167; 8(b)(4)(D) of the Taft-Hartley Act against the IAM.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p5"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;On November 18, 1952, the National Labor Relations Board quashed the notice of a hearing, holding that no 'dispute' existed within the meaning of the invoked subsection. The Board reasoned that at the time of the strike, the IAM could not have been requesting the assignment of 'particular' work to IAM members, because the IAM was not complaining about the assignment of work by respondent to its own employees, and as to work assigned by respondent's contractors, (1) the IAM had made no demand on those contractors to give their work to IAM labor, and (2) no millwright work performed by respondent's contractors at that time was in fact being performed by other than IAM labor. District No. 9, International Association of Machinists, 101 N.L.R.B. 346.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p6"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It must be emphasized that the only unfair labor practice charge filed with the Board, and the only one upon which the Board acted, was that prescribed in Subsection (D) of &amp;#167; 8(b)(4).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p7"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In the meantime, on April 19, 1952, after it had filed the charge with the Board but before the Board had acted upon it, respondent sought an injunction against the IAM in the State Circuit Court in St. Louis. In its complaint, respondent alleged that the strike constituted 'a secondary boycott under the common law of the State of Missouri,' and also was in violation of Subsections (A), (B) and (D) of &amp;#167; 8(b)(4) of the Taft-Hartley Act&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; and of &amp;#167; 303(a)(1), (2) and (4) of that same Act.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; A temporary injunction issued. On April 30, respondent amended its complaint with the additional claim that the IAM's conduct constituted an illegal conspiracy in restraint of trade under Missouri common law and conspiracy statutes. Mo.Rev.Stat.1949, &amp;#167; 416.010, V.A.M.S. The temporary injunction was thereupon made permanent on September 30, 1952, some time before the Board, it will be recalled, held that there was no violation of &amp;#167; 8(b)(4)(D) of the Taft-Hartley Act. This injunction was vacated, but immediately re-entered, on October 3, 1952.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p8"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The IAM appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court from the Circuit Court's injunction. That court affirmed the permanent injunction on February 8, 1954, more than a year after the Board found no violation of &amp;#167; 8(b)(4)(D).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p9"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Missouri Supreme Court held that the IAM's conduct constituted a violation of the State's restraint of trade statute and as such was enjoinable. It referred to the ruling of the Board as a determination that 'no labor dispute existed between these parties and that no unfair labor practices were there involved, and the Board, upon such ruling, quashed the notice of the hearing.' The court then stated: 'The cases relied on by the defendants (the IAM) are largely cases involving existing labor disputes and unfair labor practices. We think those cases are not in point.' The court concluded: 'A jurisdictional quarrel between two rival labor unions is not a labor dispute within the Norris-LaGuarardia Act, * * * the Wagner Act or the Taft-Hartley Act.' Mo.Sup., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/mo/drhj/anheuser-busch-inc-v-weber/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;265&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;S.W.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;325&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 332, 333. The State Supreme Court thus treated the Board's holding as a determination that the allegation on which the injunction issued excluded the basis for a charge of an unfair labor practice under the Taft-Hartley Act.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p10"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The principal question that the case raises, whether the state court had jurisdiction to enjoin the IAM's conduct or whether its jurisdiction had been preempted by the authority vested in the National Labor Relations Board, has an importance in the federal-state relations regarding industrial controversies that led us to grant certiorari. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;348&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;808&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 75 S.Ct. 32.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p11"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Court has had numerous occasions to deal with this delicate problem of the interplay between state and federal jurisdiction touching labor relations. It is helpful to a consideration of this latest phase briefly to summarize where our decisions, under both the Wagner Act and the Taft-Hartley Act, have brought us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p12"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;1. The Court has ruled that a State may not prohibit the exercise of rights which the federal Acts protect. Thus, in Hill v. State of Florida ex rel. Watson, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;325&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;538&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 65 S.Ct. 1373, 1375, 89 L.Ed. 1782, the State enjoined a labor union from functioning until it had complied with certain statutory requirements. The injunction was invalidated on the ground that the Wagner Act included a 'federally established right to collective bargaining' with which the injunction conflicted. International Union of United Auto, Aircraft and Agr. Implement Workers of America v. O'Brien, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;339&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;454&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 70 S.Ct. 781, 94 L.Ed. 978, involved the strike-vote provisions of a state act which prohibited the calling of a strike until a specific statutory procedure had been followed. The state act was held to conflict not only with the procedure and other requirements of the Taft-Hartley strike provisions but also with the protection afforded by &amp;#167; 7 of that Act.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; In Amalgamated Association of St. Elec. Ry. &amp;amp; Motor Coach Emp. of America v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xaL/amalgamated-assn-of-street-electric-railway/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;340&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;383&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 71 S.Ct. 359, 95 L.Ed. 364, the state court issued an injunction under a statute which made it a misdemeanor to interrupt by strike any essential public utility services. It was held that the state statute was invalid in that it denied a right which Congress had guaranteed under &amp;#167; 7 of the Taft-Hartley Act the right to strike peacefully to enforce union demands for wages, hours and working conditions. Last Term the Court noted in Garner v. Teamsters Union, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xgn/garner-v-teamsters/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;346&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;485&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 499, 74 S.Ct. 161, 170, 98 L.Ed. 228, that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p13"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'The detailed prescription of a procedure for restraint of      specified types of picketing would seem to imply that other      picketing is to be free of other methods and sources of      restraint. For the policy of the National Labor Management      Relations Act is not to condemn all picketing but only that      ascertained by its prescribed processes to fall within its      prohibitions. Otherwise, it is implicit in the Act that the      public interest is served by freedom of labor to use the      weapon of picketing. For a state to impinge on the area of      labor combat designed to be free is quite as much an      obstruction of federal policy as if the state were to declare      picketing free for purposes or by methods which the federal      Act prohibits.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p14"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;2. A State may not enjoin under its own labor statute conduct which has been made an 'unfair labor practice' under the federal statutes. Such was the holding in the Garner case, supra. The Court pointed out that exclusive primary jurisdiction to pass on the union's picketing is delegated by the Taft-Hartley Act to the National Labor Relations Board. See also Plankinton Packing Co. v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;338&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;953&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 70 S.Ct. 491, 94 L.Ed. 588, Building Trades Council v. Kinard Construction Co., &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;346&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;933&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 74 S.Ct. 373, 98 L.Ed. 423. And in Capital Service, Inc., v. Labor Board, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xhc/capital-service-inc-v-nlrb/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;347&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;501&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 74 S.Ct. 699, 98 L.Ed. 887, a picket line established at retail stores to induce the organization of a manufacturer's employees was enjoined by the State as contrary to its public policy.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="fn5_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; This Court granted a limited certiorari which assumed that exclusive jurisdiction over the subject matter was in the National Labor Relations Board.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6" id="fn6_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; The Board was allowed to obtain an injunction against enforcement of the conflicting state court injunction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p15"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;3. The federal Board's machinery for dealing with certification problems also carries implications of exclusiveness. Thus, a State may not certify a union as the collective bargaining agent for employees where the federal Board, if called upon, would use its own certification procedure. La Crosse Telephone Corp. v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x6N/la-crosse-tel-corp-v-wis-board/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;336&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 69 S.Ct. 379, 93 L.Ed. 463. The same result is reached even if the federal Board has refused certification, if the employer is subject to the Board's jurisdiction. Bethlehem Steel Co. v. New York State Labor Relations Board, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x3a/bethlehem-co-v-state-board/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;330&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;767&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 67 S.Ct. 1026, 91 L.Ed. 1234.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p16"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;4. On the other hand, in the following cases the authority which the State exercised was found not to have been exclusively absorbed by the federal enactments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p17"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In Allen-Bradley Local v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wP1/electrical-workers-v-wisconsin-employment-relation/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;315&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;740&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 62 S.Ct. 820, 86 L.Ed. 1154, the State was allowed to enjoin mass picketing, threats of bodily injury and property damage to employees, obstruction of streets and public roads, the blocking of entrance to and egress from a factory, and the picketing of employees' homes. The Court held that such conduct was not subject to regulation by the federal Board, either by prohibition or by protection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p18"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;International Union, etc., v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x75/international-union-uawa-af-of-l-local-232-v-wis-b/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;336&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;245&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 69 S.Ct. 516, 93 L.Ed. 651, involved recurrent, unannounced work stoppages. The Court upheld the state injunction on the ground that such conduct was neither prohibited nor protected by the Taft-Hartley Act and thus was open to state control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p19"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Court allowed a State to forbid enforcement of a maintenance-of-membership clause in a contract between employer and union in Algoma Plywood &amp;amp; Veneer Co. v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x78/algoma-plywood-co-v-wis-board/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;336&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;301&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 69 S.Ct. 584, 93 L.Ed. 691. Since nothing in the Wagner or Taft-Hartley Acts sanctioned or forbade these clauses, they were left to regulation by the State.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p20"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Finally, United Construction Workers v. Laburnum Construction Corp., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xhp/united-workers-v-laburnum-corp/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;347&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;656&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 74 S.Ct. 833, 98 L.Ed. 1025, was an action for damages based on violent conduct, which the state court found to be a common-law tort. While assuming that an unfair labor practice under the Taft-Hartley Act was involved, this Court sustained the state judgment on the theory that there was no compensatory relief under the federal Act and no federal administrative relief with which the state remedy conflicted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p21"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;We come, then, to the facts in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p22"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Contrary to the assumption of the Missouri Supreme Court, the Board had not ruled that no unfair labor practice was involved in the conduct by the IAM of which respondent complained. The Board had determined only that there was no violation of Subsection (D) of &amp;#167; 8(b) (4). That was, in fact, the extent of the ruling it was empowered to make, because (D) was the only subsection alleged to have been violated. In its complaint in the state court, however, respondent broadened its allegations to include violations of Subsections (A) and (B).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p23"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;We do not mean to pass on the question whether the Board, by finding that no violation of (D) was involved, inferentially ruled that other subsections were or were not violated. The point is rather that the Board, and not the state court, is empowered to pass upon such issues in the first instance. If a ruling on (D) necessarily encompassed a ruling on the other subsections, we would have a different case. But the ruling on (D) was based on the finding that no 'particular work' was involved&amp;#8212;a phrase of (D) that is absent in (A) and (B). Congress has lodged in the Board responsibility for determining in the first instance whether the same considerations apply to (A) or (B) as apply to (D).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p24"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Nor is it within our competence now to determine whether the conduct in controversy is subject to the authority of Subsections (A) or (B). Under the Board's decisions, for example, it may become pertinent whether this is eventually deemed primary pressure, directed at respondent to force insertion of the disputed clause in its contract with the IAM, rather than secondary pressure, aimed at subcontractors to force them to use IAM labor.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn7" id="fn7_ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; We are not now ruling on that distinction. However, the point is pertinent to our discussion, because even if it were clear that no unfair labor practices were involved, it would not necessarily follow that the State was free to issue its injunction. If this conduct does not fall within the prohibitions of &amp;#167; 8 of the Taft-Hartley Act, it may fall within the protection of &amp;#167; 7, as concerted activity for the purpose of mutual aid or protection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p25"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Respondent itself alleged that the union conduct it was seeking to stop came within the prohibitions of the federal Act, and yet it disregarded the Board and obtained relief from a state court. It is perfectly clear that had respondent gone first to a federal court instead of the state court, the federal court would have declined jurisdiction, at least as to the unfair labor practices, on the ground that exclusive primary jurisdiction was in the Board.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn8" id="fn8_ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; As pointed out in the Garner case, 346 U.S., at page 491, 74 S.Ct. 161, the same considerations apply to the state courts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p26"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Missouri Supreme Court over-simplified the factual situation when it called this merely a 'jurisdictional quarrel between two rival labor unions.' (265 S.W.2d 333) A jurisdictional dispute and a secondary boycott are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as respondent itself showed by alleging, inter alia, that this was a secondary boycott prohibited by Missouri common law. Even the Board has not always been consistent in its interpretations of the various subsections of &amp;#167; 8(b)(4).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p27"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Respondent argues that Missouri is not prohibiting the IAM's conduct for any reason having to do with labor relations but rather because that conduct is in contravention of a state law which deals generally with restraint of trade. It distinguishes Garner on the ground that there the State and Congress were both attempting to regulate labor relations as such.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p28"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;We do not think this distinction is decisive. In Garner the emphasis was not on two conflicting labor statutes but rather on two similar remedies, one state and one federal, brought to bear on precisely the same conduct. And in Capital Service, Inc., v. National Labor Relations Board, supra, we did not stop to inquire just what category of 'public policy' the union's conduct allegedly violated. Our approach was emphasized in United Construction Workers v. Laburnum Construction Corp., supra, where the violent conduct was reached by a remedy having no parallel in, and not in conflict with, any remedy afforded by the federal Act.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p29"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Moreover, we must not forget that this case is not clearly one of 'unfair labor practices.' Certainly if the conduct is eventually found by the National Labor Relations Board to be protected by the Taft-Hartley Act, the State cannot be heard to say that it is enjoining that conduct for reasons other than those having to do with labor relations. In Amalgamated Association v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, supra, the statute was directed at the preservation of public utility services and not at maintenance of sound labor relations, but the State's injunction was reversed. Controlling and therefore superseding federal power cannot be curtailed by the State even though the ground of intervention be different than that on which federal supremacy has been exercised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p30"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;By the Taft-Hartley Act, Congress did not exhaust the full sweep of legislative power over industrial relations given by the Commerce Clause. Congress formulated a code whereby it outlawed some aspects of labor activities and left others free for the operation of economic forces. As to both categories, the areas that have been pre-empted by federal authority and thereby withdrawn from state power are not susceptible of delimitation by fixed metes and bounds. Obvious conflict, actual or potential, leads to easy judicial exclusion of state action. Such was the situation in Garner v. Teamsters Union, supra. But as the opinion in that case recalled, the Labor Management Relations Act 'leaves much to the states, though Congress has refrained from telling us how much.' 346 U.S., at page 488, 74 S.Ct. at page 164. This penumbral area can be rendered progressively clear only by the course of litigation. Regarding the conduct here in controversy, Congress has sufficiently expressed its purpose to bring it within federal oversight and to exlude state prohibition, even though that with which the federal law is concerned as a matter of labor relations be related by the State to the more inclusive area of restraint of trade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p31"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;We realize that it is not easy for a state court to decide, merely on the basis of a complaint and answer, whether the subject matter is the concern exclusively of the federal Board and withdrawn from the State. This is particularly true in a case like this where the rulings of the Board are not wholly consistent on the meaning of the sections outlawing 'unfair labor practices', and where the area of free 'concerted activities' has not been clearly bounded. But where the moving party itself alleges unfair labor practices, where the facts reasonably bring the controversy within the sections prohibiting these practices, and where the conduct, if not prohibited by the federal Act, may be reasonably deemed to come within the protection afforded by that Act, the state court must decline jurisdiction in deference to the tribunal which Congress has selected for determining such issues in the first instance.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn9" id="fn9_ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p32"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The state decree granting the permanent injunction found that 'Defendants' (IAM's) picket line was so placed and maintained that it prevented the movement of railroad cars into and out of plaintiff's (respondent's) premises by a common carrier without danger of physical injury to the pickets, and movement of the cars was stopped for that reason.' The Missouri Supreme Court stated that 'the transportation into and out of the plant was stopped 'because it endangered their (presumably the pickets') lives and limbs'; * * *.' (265 S.W.2d 330) We do not read this as an unambiguous determination that the IAM's conduct amounted to the kind of mass picketing and overt threats of violence which under the Allen-Bradley Local case give the state court jurisdiction. It does not preclude the conclusion that the transportation was stopped for fear of crossing an otherwise peaceful picket line. In any event, the state injunction enjoined all picketing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; The complaint in the state court charged the defendant unions with engaging in 'an unlawful conspiracy combination and agreement, contrary to the common law of the State of California and contrary to the provisions of the Cartwright Act (Stats.1907, p. 1835, Ch. 530), now constituting Chapter 2 of Part 2, Division 7, of the Business and Professions Code, sections 16720, et seq., to create and carry out restrictions in trade and commerce and to prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transporting, selling and purchasing of bakery products as hereinafter set forth.' The state court, however, reasoned that primary picketing was as much a combination in restraint of trade as secondary picketing, and primary picketing had been held legal by numerous state decisions. The court instead enjoined the conduct on the ground that 'secondary picketing is contrary to the public policy of this state. * * *' Capital Service, Inc. v.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

&lt;p&gt;MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sole question presented by this case is whether a payment is taxable as gross income when received by a corporation pursuant to the "insider profits" provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; and the Investment Company Act of 1940.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Subject to exceptions not presently relevant, &#167; 16 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act provides that the profit realized from certain defined securities transactions undertaken by a director or major stockholder of the issuing corporation "shall inure to and be recoverable by the issuer."&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; This provision is made &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*435&lt;/span&gt; applicable to investment companies by &#167; 30 (f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; Under these provisions, petitioner, a registered closed-end investment company, received payments totalling $170,038.04. This sum represented the profits accruing to one of petitioner's directors and a stockholder through dealings covered by &#167; 16 (b); the money was paid over to petitioner on demand and without litigation. The payments were not reported as income on petitioner's tax returns. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue allowed a $13,000 deduction for legal expenses incurred in recovering the amounts due but asserted a deficiency for the balance on the ground that the receipts constituted taxable gains under &#167; 22 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; The Tax Court, 19 T. C. 581, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 211 F. 2d 522, sustained the Commissioner's determination. We granted certiorari, 348 U. S. 812, because of an apparent similarity of issues here to those involved in &lt;i&gt;Commissioner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Glenshaw Glass Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 211 F. 2d 928 (C. A. 3d Cir.), and the possible conflict between that case and this.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*436&lt;/span&gt; We have this day decided that the recovery of punitive damages for fraud or antitrust violation is reportable as gross income within the meaning of &#167; 22 (a). &lt;i&gt;Commissioner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Glenshaw Glass Co., ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 426. The reasons which dictated that result are equally compelling here. We see no significant difference in the nature of these receipts which might make that ruling inapplicable. As in &lt;i&gt;Glenshaw,&lt;/i&gt; the taxpayer realized the money in question free of any restrictions as to use. The payments in controversy were neither capital contributions nor gifts. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Texas &amp;amp; Pacific R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 286 U. S. 285. There is no indication that Congress intended to exempt them from coverage. In accordance with the legislative design to reach all gain constitutionally taxable unless specifically excluded, we conclude that the petitioner is liable for the tax and the judgment is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

v.&lt;br&gt;
BRAMBLETT.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;No. 159.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued February 7, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided April 4, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Charles F. Barber&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on briefs were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Beatrice Rosenberg, Ralph S. Spritzer&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Richard J. Blanchard.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Edward Bennett Williams&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for appellee. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Murdaugh Stuart Madden.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 10, 1953, an 18-count indictment was returned in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, charging the appellee, a former member &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*504&lt;/span&gt; of Congress, with violations of 18 U. S. C. &#167; 1001.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; During the course of the trial a judgment of acquittal was ordered on counts 8 through 18 of the indictment. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the remaining 7 counts which charged the appellee with having falsely and fraudulently represented to the Disbursing Office of the House of Representatives that a named woman was entitled to compensation as his official clerk. The District Court granted appellee's motion in arrest of judgment, holding that he had not falsified a material fact "within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States" since the Disbursing Office was not a department or agency within the meaning of the statute. The District Court was of the opinion that the statute does not afford protection to the legislative and judicial branches of the Government. The Government brought this case here on direct appeal pursuant to 18 U. S. C. &#167; 3731. Reference to the evolution of &#167; 1001 will assist in determining the correctness of the decision below. A detailed analysis appears in the opinion of the trial court. 120 F. Supp. 857.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 1001 had its origin in a statute passed almost 100 years ago in the wake of a spate of frauds upon the Government. The Act of March 2, 1863, 12 Stat. 696, "An Act to prevent and punish Frauds upon the Government of the United States," made it a criminal offense for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"any person in the land or naval forces of the United States . . . [to] make or cause to be made, or present &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*505&lt;/span&gt; or cause to be presented for payment or approval to or by any person or officer in the civil or military service of the United States, any claim upon or against the Government of the United States, or any department or officer thereof, knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent . . . ."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This provision clearly covers the presentation of false claims against any component of the Government to any officer of the Government. The prohibition of the statute is broad, although its application was limited to military personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False statements were proscribed in the following clause of the same section in these terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"any person in such forces or service who shall, for the purpose of obtaining, or aiding in obtaining, the approval or payment of such claim, make, use, or cause to be made or used, any false bill, receipt, voucher, entry, roll, account, claim, statement, certificate, affidavit, or deposition, knowing the same to contain any false or fraudulent statement or entry."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be noted that there is here no specification as to the group to whom the false statements had to be made. The provision in the false claims section which made the presentation of false claims to "any person or officer in the civil or military service of the United States" punishable might reasonably have been applied here. There would be no justification for giving the false statements section a narrower scope, for, so long as the false statement was made with the indicated purpose, the statute made it punishable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1863 to 1934 the coverage of the statute was at various times extended, but no change was made which could be or is taken by the appellee as restricting the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*506&lt;/span&gt; scope of the false statements provision to the executive branch.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words urged as crucial in this first appeared in the revision of 1934. 48 Stat. 996. No change was made in the false claims portion of the statute, but the false statements section was amended to read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"or whoever shall knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal or cover up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or make or cause to be made any false or fraudulent statements or representations, or make or use or cause to be made or used any false bill, receipt, voucher, roll, account, claim, certificate, affidavit, or deposition, knowing the same to contain any fraudulent or fictitious statement or entry, &lt;i&gt;in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or of any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder;&lt;/i&gt;. . . ." (Italics supplied.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amendment deleted all words as to purpose and inserted the italicized phrase. Under the prior statutes there had been no possibility of a restrictive interpretation which would read out falsifications made to officers of the legislative or judicial branches. Did the insertion of the new phrase exclude those branches? We think not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*507&lt;/span&gt; The 1934 revision was largely the product of the urging of the Secretary of the Interior.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; The Senate Report, S. Rep. No. 1202, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., indicates that its purpose was to broaden the statute so as to reach not only false papers presented in connection with a claim against the Government, but also nonmonetary frauds such as those involved in the "hot-oil" shipments. A greater variety of false statements were meant to be included.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; There is no indication in either the committee reports&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; or in the congressional debates&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; that the scope of the statute was to be in any way restricted. There was certainly no suggestion that the new phrase was to be interpreted so that only falsifications made to executive agencies would be reached.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; Apparently the italicized phrase was inserted simply to compensate for the deleted &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*508&lt;/span&gt; language as to purpose&#151;to indicate that not all falsifications but only those made to government organs were reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1948 revision put the statute into its present form.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; 62 Stat. 683. The false claims provision became &#167; 287 of Title 18 and retained its prior form without significant change. Section 1001 is the "false statements" section. Except for housekeeping changes in language which are of no particular significance, the deletion of the reference to corporations, and the transposition of the "in any matter" clause to the beginning of the section, there has been no change since the 1934 statute. There is no indication that the revision was intended to work any substantive change. It would thus be supposed that the statute retained its broad scope, a scope at least as broad as the false claims section, and could not be limited to falsifications made to executive agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appellee and the District Court rely on &#167; 6 of Title 18 to restrict the scope of &#167; 1001. Section 6 provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"As used in this title:&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The term `department' means one of the executive departments enumerated in section 1 of Title 5, unless the context shows that such term was intended to describe the executive, legislative, or judicial branches of the government.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The term `agency' includes any department, independent establishment, commission, administration, authority, board or bureau of the United States or any corporation in which the United States has a proprietary interest, unless the context shows that such term was intended to be used in a more limited sense."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*509&lt;/span&gt; The falsification here involved was held to be within the jurisdiction of the Disbursing Office of the House which it was thought could not meet the definitions in &#167; 6. It seemed significant to the trial court "that Title 18, &#167; 287 (formerly the first part of old Section 35) provides penalties against any one who `makes or presents to any person or officer in the civil, military, or naval service of the United States, or to any department or agency thereof, any claim . . . knowing such claim to be false,' " whereas &#167; 1001 does not contain such language. 120 F. Supp., at 861.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be argued that the matter here involved was within the jurisdiction of the Treasury Department, as the appellee's misstatements would require the payment of funds from the United States Treasury. Or, viewing this as a matter within the jurisdiction of the Disbursing Office, it might be argued, as the Government does, that that body is an "authority" within the &#167; 6 definition of "agency." We do not rest our decision on either of those interpretations. The context in which this language is used calls for an unrestricted interpretation. This is enforced by its legislative history. It would do violence to the purpose of Congress to limit the section to falsifications made to the executive departments. Congress could not have intended to leave frauds such as this without penalty. The development, scope and purpose of the section shows that "department," as used in this context, was meant to describe the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the Government. The difference between the language of &#167; 287 and that of &#167; 1001 can only be understood in the light of legislative history. That history dispels the possibility of attaching any significance to the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That criminal statutes are to be construed strictly is a proposition which calls for the citation of no authority. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*510&lt;/span&gt; But this does not mean that every criminal statute must be given the narrowest possible meaning in complete disregard of the purpose of the legislature.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment below is accordingly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BURTON and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  "Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Under the codification of December 1, 1873, approved June 22, 1874, R. S. &#167; 5438, the statute was extended to cover "every person"&#151;not merely military personnel. The Act of May 30, 1908, 35 Stat. 555, simply changed the penalties, and in the codification of 1909, 35 Stat. 1088, &#167; 5438 was redesignate &#167; 35. Section 35 was in turn revised in 1918, 40 Stat. 1015. The false claims provision was extended to cover corporations in which the United States held stock; and false statements were proscribed if made "for the purpose and with the intent of cheating and swindling or defrauding the Government of the United States" as well as if made for the purpose of obtaining payment of a false claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  For a discussion of the legislative history of the Act, see &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gilliland,&lt;/i&gt; 312 U. S. 86, 93-95.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  In &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cohn,&lt;/i&gt; 270 U. S. 339, the Court held that the 1918 Act did not proscribe false statements made to a customs collector where the purpose was not to defraud the Government of either its money or property. After the 1934 amendment, however, the Court sustained an indictment charging the defendants with willfully falsifying reports required to be filed under the "Hot-Oil" Act of February 22, 1935. The Court stated that the purpose of the 1934 amendment was to remove the prior "restriction to cases involving pecuniary or property loss to the government." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gilliland,&lt;/i&gt; 312 U. S. 86, 93.&lt;/p&gt;

C. 150, 167 F. 2d 521, the Sergeant at Arms of the House of Representatives of the United States was convicted of presenting false statements of his accounts and of concealing shortages in reporting to the General Accounting Office, which was created as an establishment "independent of the executive departments and under the control and direction of the Comptroller General of the United States." 42 Stat. 23, 31 U. S. C. &#167; 41.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  In 1938, &#167; 35 was divided into subsections, but the part of the statute with which we are here concerned was left unchanged. 52 Stat. 197.&lt;/p&gt;

v.&lt;br&gt;
MENASCHE.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;No. 104.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued March 1, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided April 4, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gray Thoron&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Olney, L. Paul Winings&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lorraine Wall Hurney.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Peyton Ford&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*529&lt;/span&gt; MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case and &lt;i&gt;Shomberg&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 540, present questions concerning the proper interpretation of the general savings clause of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 280, 8 U. S. C. &#167; 1101, note. This clause, &#167; 405 of the Act, provides as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(a) Nothing contained in this Act, unless otherwise specifically provided therein, shall be construed to affect the validity of any declaration of intention, petition for naturalization, certificate of naturalization, certificate of citizenship, warrant of arrest, order or warrant of deportation, order of exclusion, or other document or proceeding which shall be valid at the time this Act shall take effect; or to affect any prosecution, suit, action, or proceedings, civil or criminal, brought, or any status, condition, right in process of acquisition, act, thing, liability, obligation, or matter, civil or criminal, done or existing, at the time this Act shall take effect; but as to all such prosecutions, suits, actions, proceedings, statutes [&lt;i&gt;sic&lt;/i&gt;], conditions, rights, acts, things, liabilities, obligations, or matters the statutes or parts of statutes repealed by this Act are, unless otherwise specifically provided therein, hereby continued in force and effect. . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in title III, any petition for naturalization heretofore filed which may be pending at the time this Act shall take effect shall be heard and determined in accordance with the requirements of law in effect when such petition was filed."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue here presented is whether an alien, who filed his declaration of intention to become an American citizen before the effective date of the 1952 Act, and who otherwise complied with the naturalization laws then in &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*530&lt;/span&gt; effect, has a "status," "condition," or "right in process of acquisition" preserved by &#167; 405 (a), &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; despite the fact that his petition for naturalization was filed after the effective date of the new Act. The Government contends that petitions for naturalization are to be governed exclusively by &#167; 405 (b), and that since respondent does not come within the terms of that subsection&#151;his petition not having been filed before the effective date of the new Act&#151;the savings clause is inapplicable and the substantive provisions of the 1952 Act apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facts are not in dispute. Respondent was admitted for permanent residence in the United States on March 7, 1948, and the following month he filed his declaration of intention to become a citizen. During the next five years, respondent was absent from the United States on business for several periods of less than a year each. Although the aggregate of these absences was some forty-four months, it is conceded that respondent had not at any time abandoned his American residence. Accordingly, all other prerequisites to citizenship having been satisfied, respondent was entitled to be naturalized under the Nationality Act of 1940 upon completing five years of residence. 54 Stat. 1142, 8 U. S. C. (1946 ed.) &#167; 707. But before this period had run, the Immigration and Nationality Act became effective on December 24, 1952. Section 316 (a) of this Act, 66 Stat. 242, 8 U. S. C. &#167; 1427 (a), imposed a new requirement of physical presence: to be eligible for citizenship, an alien must be physically present in the United States for at least one-half the period constituting his five-year residence. When, on April 24, 1953, Menasche filed his petition for naturalization, he lacked 14 months of fulfilling this new requirement. Thus, if the 1952 Act applies to respondent's case, it is clear he may not be naturalized, while under the 1940 Act he is admittedly eligible for citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*531&lt;/span&gt; The district judge admitted Menasche to citizenship, holding that the 1940 Act governs because respondent enjoyed a status, condition, and right in process of acquisition preserved by &#167; 405 (a) of the new Act. 115 F. Supp. 434. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 210 F. 2d 809. We granted certiorari because of the importance of the questions presented in this and the companion case of &lt;i&gt;Shomberg&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, supra,&lt;/i&gt; in the administration of our nationality laws. 348 U. S. 811.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In interpreting &#167; 405 of the Immigration and Nationality Act in relation to the facts of this case, we must consider the historical background of the savings clause and of the procedure for filing declarations of intention. The declaration of intention was introduced into our law by the second Act of Congress on the subject of naturalization, 1 Stat. 414 (1795), and remained an integral part of our naturalization procedure until the Act of 1952 dispensed with it as a prerequisite to citizenship. 66 Stat. 254, 8 U. S. C. &#167; 1445 (f). For the more than 150 years between these enactments, Congress considered it appropriate to require aliens to declare their intention to become United States citizens several years before they petitioned for naturalization. Exceptions were made from time to time to avoid hardship or to expedite the naturalization of a favored group, but until the 1952 enactment the declaration constituted the "first papers" toward American citizenship in the usual naturalization procedure. See Joint Hearings before the Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., on S. 716, H. R. 2379, and H. R. 2816, pp. 79-80, 723-725; S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 732-734.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Savings clauses of the type here involved&#151;broad, inclusive provisions&#151;date back to the general statutes on immigration and naturalization enacted in the early part of this century. The Naturalization Act of 1906, 34 Stat. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*532&lt;/span&gt; 596, the first real codification of our nationality laws, did not contain a general savings clause, but sought to protect certain prior rights by means of specific provisions. 34 Stat. 597, 599, 603. Nor was there an over-all savings provision in the first of the general immigration laws following the turn of the century. 32 Stat. 1213 (1903). The germ was there, however, in a clause stating that "nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to affect any prosecution or other proceeding, criminal or civil," begun under a prior Act. 32 Stat. 1220. In subsequent immigration laws, the predecessors of the instant provision could be more clearly discerned. The Immigration Act of 1907 provided that nothing in the Act "shall be construed to affect any prosecution, suit, action, or proceedings brought, or any act, thing, or matter, civil or criminal, done or existing at the time of the taking effect of this Act." 34 Stat. 907. To the same effect is the savings clause of the Immigration Act of 1917. 39 Stat. 897. In the years that followed, amendments to the immigration and naturalization laws were enacted with more limited savings clauses, tailored to the special changes made by the new legislation. 40 Stat. 545, 547, 548; 40 Stat. 559, amended, 55 Stat. 252; 42 Stat. 1022; 43 Stat. 169; 46 Stat. 854.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; These provisions, though differing in their terms, manifested an intention on the part of Congress to save rights which had accrued under prior laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direct antecedent of the savings clause here involved appeared as &#167; 347 of the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1168, 8 U. S. C. (1946 ed.) &#167; 747, the last legislation prior to 1952 to deal with our general system of naturalization. Like the present &#167; 405, the provision in the 1940 Act was divided into two subsections. The first of these, subsection (a), expanded upon the multiplicity of legal &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*533&lt;/span&gt; subjects preserved by the 1907 and 1917 immigration laws.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Subsection (b), on the other hand, introduced an entirely new wrinkle by providing that pending naturalization petitions "shall be heard and determined within two years thereafter in accordance with the requirements of law in effect when such petition was filed."&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; The litigation under this section, involving, first, the scope of subsection (a) and, secondly, the relation between the two subsections, throws considerable light on the parallel problems under &#167; 405 presented in the instant case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1952 Act made the enumeration of matters preserved by subsection (a) more complete and all-inclusive by adding: "status," "condition," "right in process of acquisition," "liability," and "obligation." The change was undoubtedly prompted by several sets of inconsistent decisions dealing with the vague terminology in &#167; 347 (a) of the 1940 Act preserving "any act, thing, or matter, civil or criminal." The first of these concerned the question whether the withdrawal of a declaration of intention to avoid service in the armed forces constituted an "act" existing under the prior law which continued to debar the alien from citizenship. Compare &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*534&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Petition of Otness,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;49&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;220&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, with &lt;i&gt;In re Urmeneta,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;138&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;In re Samowich,&lt;/i&gt; 70 F. Supp. 273. A second and more significant conflict concerned inchoate rights to derivative citizenship, which, when proper conditions were met, required only the passage of time to ripen into full citizenship. When the 1940 Act changed certain of the conditions in this process, the question arose whether those whose time had begun to run before the 1940 Act took effect were to be governed by the old law or the new. The Second Circuit held that the new law applied, because &#167; 347 (a) of the 1940 Act did not extend to "a mere condition, unattended by any affirmative action." &lt;i&gt;United States ex rel. Aberasturi&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cain,&lt;/i&gt; 147 F. 2d 449, 452. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia disagreed, construing the broad language of &#167; 347 (a) as covering "rights partly accrued" and "rights in process of acquisition." &lt;i&gt;Bertoldi&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McGrath,&lt;/i&gt; 86 U. S. App. D. C. 1, 2, 3, 178 F. 2d 977, 978, 979. This latter conflict must have been paramount in the minds of Congress when the first subsection of the savings clause was broadened. See Analysis of S. 3455, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 361-1 and 361-2 (prepared by the Immigration and Naturalization Service for the committees of Congress considering this legislation). We conclude that Congress intended to adopt the principle of the &lt;i&gt;Bertoldi&lt;/i&gt; case that "the new act should take effect prospectively." 86 U. S. App. D. C., at 2, 178 F. 2d, at 978. This is, after all, no more than a reaffirmation of the principle underlying the less sweeping 1940 provision. In a report to the congressional committees considering this earlier section, it was said that the provision "contains the customary clauses by which the status quo is maintained in relation to naturalization proceedings and other related matters." Report of the Joint Departmental Committee, reproduced in Hearings before House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization, 76th Cong., &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*535&lt;/span&gt; 1st Sess., on H. R. 6127, superseded by H. R. 9980, 411, 484.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government would have us limit the 1952 extension of subsection (a) to situations concerning derivative citizenship, arguing that this problem was entirely responsible for the new language on status, condition, and right in process of acquisition. With this we cannot agree. The change in the section was designed to extend a savings clause already broadly drawn, and embodies, we believe, congressional acceptance of the principle that the statutory &lt;i&gt;status quo&lt;/i&gt; was to continue even as to rights not fully matured. It should be noted, further, that the conflict between &lt;i&gt;Aberasturi&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bertoldi&lt;/i&gt; involved a situation where the alien had failed to take &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; affirmative action to assert his claim to citizenship. Even the more restrictive &lt;i&gt;Aberasturi&lt;/i&gt; opinion recognized that affirmative action by the alien might alter the result there reached. 147 F. 2d, at 452. If Congress was willing to preserve a "mere condition, unattended by any affirmative action," we think its savings clause also reaches instances, such as this, where affirmative action is present. The whole development of this general savings clause, its predecessors accompanying each of the recent codifications in the field of immigration and naturalization, manifests a well-established congressional policy not to strip aliens of advantages gained under prior laws. The consistent broadening of the savings provision, particularly in its general terminology, indicates that this policy of preservation was intended to apply to matters both within and without the specific contemplation of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government argues against hinging statuses, conditions and rights in process of acquisition on the filing of a declaration of intention, because, it contends, the 1952 Act has rendered such declarations totally meaningless as far as naturalization proceedings are concerned. They are no longer a prerequisite to naturalization and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*536&lt;/span&gt; they confer no special advantage on the alien-declarant.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; But all this is immaterial. First, the congressional resolution of the &lt;i&gt;Bertoldi-Aberasturi&lt;/i&gt; conflict indicates a willingness, at least in some situations, to preserve rights in process of acquisition without requiring affirmative action on the part of the alien. It could be argued in the present case that it was Menasche's residence, rather than his filing of the declaration, which gave rise to his rights under &#167; 405 (a). And this approach would have the virtue of eliminating the inequitable treatment envisaged by the Government as regards those special groups of aliens who did not have to file declarations as a prerequisite to citizenship. But while our decision could be rested on this ground, it is sufficient here merely to refer to the provision in &#167; 405 (a), derived verbatim from &#167; 347 (a) of the 1940 Act, preserving the "validity" of declarations of intention "valid at the time this Act shall take effect."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government contends, however, that even if &#167; 405 (a), considered alone, covers this case, &#167; 405 (b) deals specifically with naturalization petitions and by necessary implication excludes their coverage in &#167; 405 (a). As we read the statute, subsection (b) merely implements and emphasizes the operation of its forerunner. It is clear, first, that subsection (b) is not a specific exception to &#167; 405 (a), since &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; subsections state that prior law should apply in certain circumstances. The slight negative implication derived from the fact that &#167; 405 (b) applies to &lt;i&gt;pending&lt;/i&gt; petitions for naturalization, and not to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*537&lt;/span&gt; those filed after the effective date of the new Act, is overcome by the broad sweep of &#167; 405 (a) and its direction that prior law applies unless the Act "otherwise &lt;i&gt;specifically&lt;/i&gt; provide[s]."&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; (Emphasis supplied.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view is strengthened by the relation between the predecessors of &#167; 405 (a) and (b). The Report of the Joint Departmental Committee, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 484, stated that under &#167; 347 (b) of the 1940 Act "a period of 2 years would be granted during which any petition for naturalization filed prior to the enactment of the new measure might be heard under the law in effect when the proceeding was begun." The approach of the courts, in dealing with pending naturalization petitions alleged to be governed by the 1940 savings clause, was generally to see whether petitioner's rights were saved by &#167; 347 (a), and then, if applicable, apply the two-year limitation of &#167; 347 (b). See &lt;i&gt;In re Shaver,&lt;/i&gt; 140 F. 2d 180; &lt;i&gt;Petition of La Bella,&lt;/i&gt; 52 F. Supp. 980; &lt;i&gt;Petition of Hirsch,&lt;/i&gt; 50 F. Supp. 638; &lt;i&gt;In re McInnis,&lt;/i&gt; 50 F. Supp. 303. But cf. &lt;i&gt;Petition of Ferrara,&lt;/i&gt; 43 N. Y. S. 2d 244. Thus &#167; 347 (a) was considered the source &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*538&lt;/span&gt; of rights under the savings clause, and &#167; 347 (b) merely a special limitation on these rights. Indeed, there were two cases in which petitions of naturalization filed &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the effective date of the 1940 Act were considered solely in relation to &#167; 347 (a). &lt;i&gt;In re Samowich,&lt;/i&gt; 70 F. Supp. 273; &lt;i&gt;Petition of Rothschild,&lt;/i&gt; 57 F. Supp. 814. These decisions ignored the supposedly obvious negative implications of &#167; 347 (b), and cast considerable doubt on the Government's present view that &#167; 347 (b) automatically removed from the coverage of prior law petitions filed after the effective date of the 1940 Act. Thus the construction advanced by the Government concerning the relation between &#167; 405 (a) and &#167; 405 (b) would not continue the relation between the predecessor provisions, but would actually be a marked departure. The only significant change made in subsection (b) by the 1952 Act was the deletion of the two-year time limit, and there is nothing to indicate that Congress, in making this change, intended to alter the entire structure of the savings clause by making &#167; 405 (b) the exclusive provision for naturalization petitions. See Analysis of S. 3455, &lt;i&gt;supra.&lt;/i&gt; The few decisions considering this problem under the 1952 Act accord with the decisions of the District Court and Court of Appeals in the instant case, holding that &#167; 405 (a) preserves rights accruing in the pre-petition stages of the naturalization process. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pringle,&lt;/i&gt; 212 F. 2d 878, affirming 122 F. Supp. 90; &lt;i&gt;In re Jocson,&lt;/i&gt; 117 F. Supp. 528. We believe that Congress so intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government's contention that &#167; 405 (a) does not apply to any phase in the processing of naturalization petitions would defeat and destroy the plain meaning of that section. "The cardinal principle of statutory construction is to save and not to destroy." &lt;i&gt;Labor Board&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jones &amp;amp; Laughlin Steel Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 301 U. S. 1, 30. It is our duty "to give effect, if possible, to every &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*539&lt;/span&gt; clause and word of a statute," &lt;i&gt;Montclair&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ramsdell,&lt;/i&gt; 107 U. S. 147, 152, rather than to emasculate an entire section, as the Government's interpretation requires. Accordingly, we hold that respondent's inchoate right to citizenship is protected by &#167; 405 (a) and is not defeated by any implication stemming from &#167; 405 (b). All that remains, therefore, is to look to &#167; 316 (a), which imposes the new requirement of physical presence, to determine whether it "otherwise specifically provide[s]" that the new Act is to apply to respondent's situation. It is clear that it does not. Section 316 (a) merely says that, "except as otherwise provided," the stated degree of physical presence shall be required, and this may be viewed as a reference, &lt;i&gt;inter alia,&lt;/i&gt; to &#167; 405 (a), strengthening our conclusion that prior law applies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Court and the Court of Appeals were correct in concluding that &#167; 405 (a) preserved respondent's inchoate rights under the prior law, and their decisions are accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  See also 54 Stat. 1150, 8 U. S. C. (1946 ed.) &#167; 726; 64 Stat. 1015, 8 U. S. C. (1946 ed., Supp. V) &#167; 725 (b).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  "SEC. 347. (a) Nothing contained in either chapter III or in chapter V of this Act, unless otherwise provided therein, shall be construed to affect the validity of any declaration of intention, petition for naturalization, certificate of naturalization or of citizenship, or other document or proceeding which shall be valid at the time this Act shall take effect; or to affect any prosecution, suit, action, or proceedings, civil or criminal, brought, or any act, thing, or matter, civil or criminal, done or existing, at the time this Act shall take effect; but as to all such prosecutions, suits, actions, proceedings, acts, things, or matters, the statutes or parts of statutes repealed by this Act, are hereby continued in force and effect."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  "(b) Any petition for naturalization heretofore filed which may be pending at the time this Act shall take effect shall be heard and determined within two years thereafter in accordance with the requirements of law in effect when such petition was filed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  The alien may, if he wishes, file a declaration of intention with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 66 Stat. 254, 8 U. S. C. &#167; 1445 (f). The apparent object of this optional provision is to preserve the rights of aliens under state laws, where, for example, there may be a requirement that a legally resident alien shall have filed his declaration of intention before he can obtain work. See Joint Hearings on S. 716, H. R. 2379 and H. R. 2816, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; p. 80; S. Rep. No. 1515, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; p. 738.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  It is possible, although we do not pass on the point in this opinion, that &#167; 405 (b) serves a function which carries with it a negative implication different from that advanced by the Government. Section 405 (b) provides that pending petitions for naturalization shall be governed by the "law in effect &lt;i&gt;when such petition was filed.&lt;/i&gt;" (Emphasis supplied.) Section 405 (a), on the other hand, provides that nothing in the new Act shall "affect" any of the enumerated subjects, preserving the law as it existed &lt;i&gt;immediately prior to the effective date of the Act.&lt;/i&gt; Thus &#167; 405 (b) may "otherwise specifically provid[e]" for a law applicable to pending petitions different from the law preserved by &#167; 405 (a) for other protected interests. We have not fully considered, in passing on the question before us, the consonance of such an interpretation with the over-all statutory scheme, but advance it merely as another illustration of the meaning which can be given &#167; 405 (b) to avoid both the result pressed by the Government in this case and the objection that &#167; 405 (b) is rendered redundant by holding that petitioner has rights protected by &#167; 405 (a).&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*512&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;William J. Isaacson&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Louis H. Pollak.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By special leave of Court, &lt;i&gt;Philip Elman&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the National Labor Relations Board, as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae,&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, David P. Findling, Dominick L. Manoli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Norton J. Come.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Luther Day&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Weber&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Anheuser-Busch, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 348 U. S. 468, decided last Monday on writ of certiorari to the Missouri Supreme Court, we considered the jurisdiction of a state court to enjoin conduct which in one aspect brought it within exclusive federal authority under the Taft-Hartley Act and in another constituted a violation of a state statute against restraint of trade. In this case we have to decide the question whether, under similar circumstances, a union has open to it, without resorting to the appellate procedures of the State and eventually of this Court, jurisdiction of a federal district court to enjoin the employer from pursuing his action in the state court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner, an unincorporated association of clothing workers, was responsible for peaceful picketing of a number of respondent's retail stores, presumably to compel its factory employees to join the union. Respondent, an Ohio corporation engaged in the manufacture and sale of men's clothing in interstate commerce, filed suit in the Court of Common Pleas for Cuyahoga County, Ohio, alleging that the union's conduct constituted a common-law conspiracy as well as a statutory and common-law restraint of trade. It prayed for temporary and permanent injunctions. The union brought proceedings to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*513&lt;/span&gt; remove the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, claiming that the employer's petition alleged facts bringing the case within the original jurisdiction of the District Court as a civil action arising under the Taft-Hartley Act. 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1337. That court remanded the action to the state court on the ground that if, as the union contended, the complaint in effect alleged a violation of &#167; 8 (b) (1) (A) of the Taft-Hartley Act, under the decision in &lt;i&gt;Garner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Teamsters Union,&lt;/i&gt; 346 U. S. 485, only the National Labor Relations Board had jurisdiction of its subject matter. &lt;i&gt;Richman Brothers Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Amalgamated Clothing Workers,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ohnd/cy87/richman-bros-co-v-amalgamated-clothing-wkrs/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;114&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;185&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, rehearing denied, 116 F. Supp. 800.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon remand, the union invoked the ground taken by the District Court in denying its jurisdiction in a motion to dismiss the action in the state court. This motion was denied without opinion. The union then filed this complaint in the same District Court seeking an injunction which would require the employer to withdraw the action commenced in the state court. Jurisdiction was based on 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1337. This provision confers jurisdiction on federal courts over any civil action arising under any Act of Congress regulating interstate commerce. The union also relied on 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1651, the all-writs section. The District Court held that under 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2283, which prohibits federal injunctions against state court proceedings, it was without power to grant the requested relief, inasmuch as the action did not come within any of the exceptions to that general prohibition. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit unanimously affirmed, 211 F. 2d 449. The jurisdictional question is plainly important in this area of federal-state relations and we granted certiorari, 348 U. S. 813.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequent to the affirmance by the Court of Appeals, the Ohio Court of Common Pleas ruled favorably on the employer's motion for a temporary injunction. &lt;i&gt;Richman&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*514&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Brothers Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Amalgamated Clothing Workers,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;51&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ohio Op.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;145&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 116 N. E. 2d 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Under the decision in &lt;i&gt;Weber&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Anheuser-Busch, Inc&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.,&lt;/i&gt; we may assume that the conduct in controversy is subject to whatever relief the Taft-Hartley Act may afford, and therefore is outside state authority. The question is whether a federal court may, before complaint has been entertained by the Board and at the request of one of the private parties, enjoin the attempt to secure relief through state proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need not re-examine the series of decisions, prior to the enactment of Title 28 of the United States Code in 1948, which appeared to recognize implied exceptions to the historic prohibition against federal interference with state judicial proceedings. See &lt;i&gt;Toucey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York Life Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 314 U. S. 118. By that enactment, Congress made clear beyond cavil that the prohibition is not to be whittled away by judicial improvisation. Former &#167; 265 of the Judicial Code provided:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The writ of injunction shall not be granted by any court of the United States to stay proceedings in any court of a State, except in cases where such injunction may be authorized by any law relating to proceedings in bankruptcy." 36 Stat. 1162.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1948 enactment revised as well as codified. The old section was thus embodied in the new &#167; 2283:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lieu of the bankruptcy exception of &#167; 265, Congress substituted a generalized phrase covering all exceptions, such as that of the Interpleader Act, 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2361, to be found in federal statutes. Two newly formulated &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*515&lt;/span&gt; exceptions to the general prohibition deal with problems of judicial administration which had earlier been the subject of the series of decisions dealt with in the &lt;i&gt;Toucey&lt;/i&gt; case. If confirmation of the comprehensive scope thus revealed on the face of the enactment were necessary, it is to be found in the Reviser's Notes, which state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"An exception as to Acts of Congress relating to bankruptcy was omitted and the general exception substituted to cover all exceptions."&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the face of this carefully considered enactment, we cannot accept the argument of petitioner and the Board, as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae,&lt;/i&gt; that &#167; 2283 does not apply whenever the moving party in the District Court alleges that the state court is "wholly without jurisdiction over the subject matter, having invaded a field preempted by Congress." No such exception had been established by judicial decision under former &#167; 265.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; In any event, Congress has left no justification for its recognition now. This is not a &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*516&lt;/span&gt; statute conveying a broad general policy for appropriate &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt; application. Legislative policy is here expressed in a clear-cut prohibition qualified only by specifically defined exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are further admonished against taking the liberty of interpolation when Congress clearly left no room for it, by the inadmissibility of the assumption that ascertainment of pre-emption under the Taft-Hartley Act is self-determining or even easy. As we have noted in the &lt;i&gt;Weber&lt;/i&gt; case, "the areas that have been pre-empted by federal authority and thereby withdrawn from state power are not susceptible of delimitation by fixed metes and bounds." 348 U. S., at 480. What is within exclusive federal authority may first have to be determined by this Court to be so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. We turn, therefore, to the specific exemptions contained in &#167; 2283. The first of these permits an injunction to issue "as expressly authorized by Act of Congress." In the present case we are directed to no "express" authorization within even the most attenuated meaning of the term. Of course no prescribed formula is required; an authorization need not expressly refer to &#167; 2283. But the only "express" authorization, in the freest use of the word, to be found in the Taft-Hartley Act does not help petitioner. Congress has provided an administrative agency to pass on claims that rights granted by the Act are denied or that restrictions imposed by the Act are disregarded. Only after the Board has found such claims to be well-founded and has formulated remedies for their vindication does the jurisdiction for review by the Court of Appeals come into being. However, injunctive relief or a temporary restraining order may be obtained by the Board from the appropriate District Court, pending final adjudication by the Board, "upon issuance of a complaint" by the Board or when there is "reasonable cause to believe" in the truth of a charge that a party "has &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*517&lt;/span&gt; engaged in an unfair labor practice within the meaning of paragraph (4) (A), (B), or (C) of section 8 (b)." Congress explicitly gave such jurisdiction to the district courts only on behalf of the Board on a petition by it or "the officer or regional attorney to whom the matter may be referred." &#167; 10 (j), (l), 61 Stat. 149, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 160 (j), (l). To hold that the Taft-Hartley Act also authorizes a private litigant to secure interim relief would be to ignore the closely circumscribed jurisdiction given to the District Court and to generalize where Congress has chosen to specify. To find exclusive authority for relief vested in the Board and not in private parties accords with other aspects of the Act. See &lt;i&gt;Amalgamated Utility Workers&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Consolidated Edison Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 309 U. S. 261. Such was the authority recognized in &lt;i&gt;Capital Service, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Labor Board,&lt;/i&gt; 347 U. S. 501.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the argument is made that to permit the state courts to proceed unchecked in their incursion upon a federally pre-empted domain dislocates the federal scheme as a whole. This argument is only a rephrasing of the suggestion that whenever Congress is found to have pre-empted a field by legislation &#167; 2283 must yield. But its thrust is deeper in the particular circumstances of this case. If the employer's use of the judicial process of the State does not amount to an unfair labor practice, and if the Board is without power to seek an injunction before a complaint is filed with it, the federal mechanism will not be invoked and federally protected rights may be denied until the injunction is lifted. The employer, who might have brought a charge of an unfair labor practice before the Board, has chosen to ignore his remedy under the Taft-Hartley Act. The temporary injunction which has been issued is not, under Ohio law, appealable,&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*518&lt;/span&gt; the appellate procedures which will be available if a permanent injunction is issued are necessarily time-consuming. Thus, so the argument runs, unless the federal court can intervene, delay will not only undercut the legislative scheme, but opportunity for effective union activity may be diminished if not lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assumption upon which the argument proceeds is that federal rights will not be adequately protected in the state courts, and the "gap" complained of is impatience with the appellate process if state courts go wrong. But during more than half of our history Congress, in establishing the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts, in the main relied on the adequacy of the state judicial systems to enforce federal rights, subject to review by this Court. With limited exceptions, it was not until 1875 that the lower federal courts were given general jurisdiction over federal questions.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; During that entire period, the vindication of federal rights depended upon the procedure which petitioner attacks as so grossly inadequate that it could not have been contemplated by Congress. The prohibition of &#167; 2283 is but continuing evidence of confidence in the state courts, reinforced by a desire to avoid direct conflicts between state and federal courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot assume that this confidence has been misplaced. Neither the course of this case, nor the history of state court actions since the decision in &lt;i&gt;Garner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Teamsters Union,&lt;/i&gt; 346 U. S. 485, demonstrates recalcitrance &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*519&lt;/span&gt; on the part of state courts to recognize the rather subtle line of demarcation between exclusive federal and allowable state jurisdiction over labor problems. In its effort to define what has been withdrawn from the States and what has been left them, the opinion in &lt;i&gt;Garner,&lt;/i&gt; decided just last Term, was hedged with qualifications, even in a case which dealt only with state court enforcement of a state labor policy as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misapplication of this Court's opinions is not confined to the state courts, nor are delays in litigation peculiar to them. To permit the federal courts to interfere, as a matter of judicial notions of policy, may add to the number of courts which pass on a controversy before the rightful forum for its settlement is established. A district court's assertion of equity power or its denial may in turn give rise to appellate review on this collateral issue. There may also be added an element of federal-state competition and conflict which may be trusted to be exploited and to complicate, not simplify, existing difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The exception to &#167; 2283 which permits the District Court to issue injunctions "where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction" remains to be considered. In no lawyer-like sense can the present proceeding be thought to be in aid of the District Court's jurisdiction. Under no circumstances has the District Court jurisdiction to enforce rights and duties which call for recognition by the Board. Such nonexistent jurisdiction therefore cannot be aided.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*520&lt;/span&gt; Insofar as protection is needed for the Board's exercise of its jurisdiction, Congress has, as we have seen, specifically provided for resort, but only by the Board, to the District Court's equity powers. Since the very presupposition of this proceeding is that jurisdiction of the subject matter of which the employer complained was in the Board and not in the state court, any aid that is needed to protect jurisdiction is the aid which the Board may need for the safeguarding of its authority. Such aid only the Board could seek, and only if, in a case pending before it, it has satisfied itself as to the adequacy of the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is urged that an employer may deliberately prevent Board action by going into a state court. For one thing, it has not yet been determined that, if an employer resorts to a state court in relation to conduct that is obviously taken over by the Taft-Hartley Act and outside the bounds of state relief, it may not under appropriate circumstances give ground for a finding of an unfair labor practice.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; In any event, if resort to a state court &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*521&lt;/span&gt; may not be circumvented by the power of the Board to entertain such a complaint, we are bound to repeat that, insofar as a penumbral region must remain between state and federal authority touching industrial relations until finally clarified by definitive rulings here or further legislation by Congress, state litigation must, in view of &#167; 2283, be allowed to run its course, including the ultimate reviewing power in this Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concur, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There can be no doubt, apart from the limitations of 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2283,&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; that the District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1337&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; to issue the injunction sought by the union in this case. This Court so held in &lt;i&gt;Capital Service&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Labor Board,&lt;/i&gt; 347 U. S. 501. It is true that the plaintiff in &lt;i&gt;Capital Service&lt;/i&gt; was the National Labor Relations Board, but &#167; 1337 is general in terms and makes no distinction between public and private plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, as in &lt;i&gt;Capital Service,&lt;/i&gt; the question is whether &#167; 2283, on the facts of this case, precludes the exercise of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*522&lt;/span&gt; jurisdiction under &#167; 1337. In &lt;i&gt;Capital Service,&lt;/i&gt; the Court stated (347 U. S., at 505, n. 2):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In view of our ruling, we find it unnecessary to consider whether, apart from the specific exceptions contained in &#167; 2283, the District Court was justified in enjoining this intrusion on an exclusive federal jurisdiction. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Bowles&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Willingham,&lt;/i&gt; 321 U. S. 503, 510-511."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That question is now here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;i&gt;Willingham&lt;/i&gt; case, a landlord had obtained a state court injunction restraining the Price Administrator from issuing certain rent orders under the Emergency Price Control Act. The Price Administrator brought an action in a federal district court to enjoin enforcement of the state court injunction. Exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of rent orders, the Administrator argued, was vested by Congress in the Emergency Court of Appeals. This Court upheld the Administrator's position. As one ground for its decision that &#167; 265 of the Judicial Code&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&#151;the predecessor of &#167; 2283&#151;was no bar to the injunction sought by the Administrator, the Court stated (321 U. S., at 511):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Congress thus preempted jurisdiction in favor of the Emergency Court to the exclusion of state courts. The rule expressed in &#167; 265 which is designed to avoid collisions between state and federal authorities (&lt;i&gt;Toucey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York Life Ins. Co., supra&lt;/i&gt;) thus does not come into play."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*523&lt;/span&gt; Thus stood the law in 1948 when &#167; 265 was succeeded by the present &#167; 2283.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the suggestion of the majority opinion, &#167; 2283 is not broader in scope than its predecessor, &#167; 265. Indeed, the express purpose of &#167; 2283 was to contract&#151;not expand&#151;the prohibition of &#167; 265. The Revisers stated that "An exception as to Acts of Congress relating to bankruptcy was omitted and the general exception substituted &lt;i&gt;to cover all exceptions.&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; (Italics added.) The only substantive change noted by the Revisers was an overruling of this Court's decision in &lt;i&gt;Toucey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York Life Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 314 U. S. 118. The &lt;i&gt;Toucey&lt;/i&gt; decision held that &#167; 265 barred a federal court from enjoining a state court &lt;i&gt;in personam&lt;/i&gt; proceeding involving a claim previously adjudicated by the federal court. The Revisers, expressly approving the &lt;i&gt;Toucey&lt;/i&gt; dissent, stated that "the revised section restores the basic law as generally understood and interpreted prior to the Toucey [&lt;i&gt;sic&lt;/i&gt;] decision. Changes were made in phraseology."&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; By enacting &#167; 2283, Congress thus rejected the &lt;i&gt;Toucey&lt;/i&gt; decision and its philosophy of judicial inflexibility.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; However imprecise may be the language of &#167; 2283, its legislative history makes it abundantly clear that the provision was not intended to repeal pre-existing exceptions to &#167; 265.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To read &#167; 2283 literally&#151;as the majority opinion does&#151; ignores not only this legislative history but also over a century of judicial history.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; In addition, for the reasons &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*524&lt;/span&gt; pointed out by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS in his dissenting opinion, such a literal interpretation seriously frustrates a comprehensive regulatory scheme established by Congress for the resolution of the kind of labor dispute involved here. The Board, although clearly having exclusive jurisdiction of the subject matter, cannot adjudicate the dispute as long as the employer does not file an unfair labor practice charge; and the employer has no incentive to do so as long as the state court injunction is outstanding. I would reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BLACK concur, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments." So reads 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2283. So read, apart from exceptions not relevant here, former &#167; 265 of the Judicial Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the law, as explained in &lt;i&gt;Oklahoma Packing Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gas Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 309 U. S. 4, 9, was "to prevent needless friction between state and federal courts." It is, however, construed and applied today in a way which can only defeat a federal regulatory scheme. For today's decision allows state courts to intrude in a domain where the federal agencies, &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; the National Labor Relations Board and the District Court, have been granted primary and exclusive jurisdiction, without leaving the aggrieved party any effective relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a case where the state court has concurrent jurisdiction with the federal agencies. The matter on which the state court takes hold has been pre-empted by the Congress and placed as firmly and completely in the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*525&lt;/span&gt; federal domain as if Congress by express words had forbidden state courts to intrude. The addition of an express exception to &#167; 2283 would not make the congressional purpose any clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where Congress has made clear that federal agencies have exclusive jurisdiction of a controversy, that legislation should be taken to qualify &#167; 2283 &lt;i&gt;pro tanto.&lt;/i&gt; That has been the view up to this time. The Removal Acts, starting with 1 Stat. 73, 79, allowed cases to be removed from state to federal courts, and provided that a case once removed passed beyond the jurisdiction of the state courts. Those Acts were construed to qualify the predecessor of &#167; 2283. &lt;i&gt;Dietzsch&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Huidekoper,&lt;/i&gt; 103 U. S. 494; &lt;i&gt;Madisonville Traction Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mining Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 196 U. S. 239, 245. The same construction was given an Act of 1851 which limited the liability of shipowners and provided that, after a shipowner transfers his interest in the vessel to a trustee for the benefit of the claimants, "all claims and proceedings against the owner or owners shall cease." 9 Stat. 635, 636. The Court held in &lt;i&gt;Providence &amp;amp; N. Y. S. S. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hill Mfg. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 109 U. S. 578, 600, that, despite the predecessor to &#167; 2283, the Limited Liability Act ousted the state courts, since otherwise the Act would be thwarted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those cases showed no clearer need for the qualification of &#167; 2283 &lt;i&gt;pro tanto&lt;/i&gt; than does the Taft-Hartley Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court has been ready to imply other exceptions to &#167; 2283, where the common sense of the situation required it. Thus, if the federal court first takes possession of a &lt;i&gt;res,&lt;/i&gt; it may protect its control over it, even to the extent of enjoining a state court from interfering with the property. That result flies in the face of the literal words of &#167; 2283. Yet the injunction is allowed to issue as the preferable way of avoiding unseemly clashes between state and federal authorities. See &lt;i&gt;Hagan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lucas,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ryv/hagan-v-lucas/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Pet.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 403; &lt;i&gt;Kline&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Burke Constr. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 260 U. S. 226, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*526&lt;/span&gt; 229, 235. Another illustration, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE points out, is &lt;i&gt;Bowles&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Willingham,&lt;/i&gt; 321 U. S. 503, where the case for exclusive jurisdiction of the federal authorities was no stronger than the one now presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A like exception is needed here, if the state suit is not to dislocate severely the federal regulatory scheme. Under the present decision, an employer can move in the state courts for an injunction against the strike. The injunction, if granted, may for all practical purposes settle the matter. There is no way for the union to transfer the dispute to the federal Board, for it seems to be assumed by both parties that the employer has committed no unfair labor practice. By today's decision the federal court is powerless to enjoin the state action. The case lingers on in the state court. There can be no appeal to this Court from the temporary injunction. &lt;i&gt;Building Union&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ledbetter Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 344 U. S. 178. It may take substantial time in the trial court to prepare a record to support a permanent injunction. Once one is granted, the long, drawn-out appeal through the state hierarchy and on to this Court commences. Yet by the time this Court decides that from the very beginning the state court had no jurisdiction, as it must under the principle of &lt;i&gt;Garner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Teamsters Union,&lt;/i&gt; 346 U. S. 485, a year or more has passed; and time alone has probably defeated the claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That course undermines the federal regulation; it emasculates the federal remedy; it allows one party to a labor-management controversy to circumvent the law which Congress enacted to resolve these disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal regulatory scheme cries out for protection against these tactics of evasion. No one is in a position to seek the protection of the federal court, except the federal Board or a party to the dispute who is aggrieved. Either should be allowed standing under the principle of &lt;i&gt;Capital&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*527&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Service, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Labor Board,&lt;/i&gt; 347 U. S. 501, to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal court. Certainly a suit to protect the exclusive jurisdiction of federal agencies under the Taft-Hartley Act is a suit "arising under any Act of Congress regulating commerce" within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1337. See &lt;i&gt;Capital Service, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Labor Board, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 504.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  H. R. Rep. No. 308, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. A181. Petitioner and the Board, as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae,&lt;/i&gt; emphasize the statement in the Reviser's Notes that "the revised section restores the basic law as generally understood and interpreted prior to the Toucy [&lt;i&gt;sic&lt;/i&gt;] decision." Even if taken to mean that, despite the revised wording, the section is to derive its content from decisions prior to 1948, these contain no precedent for the present proceeding. See note 2, &lt;i&gt;infra.&lt;/i&gt; Moreover, in context it is clear that the quoted phrase refers only to the particular problem which was before the Court in the &lt;i&gt;Toucey&lt;/i&gt; case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The statement in &lt;i&gt;Bowles&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Willingham,&lt;/i&gt; 321 U. S. 503, 511, that "Congress thus preempted jurisdiction in favor of the Emergency Court to the exclusion of state courts. The rule expressed in &#167; 265 which is designed to avoid collisions between state and federal authorities. . . thus does not come into play," must be read in the context of the scheme of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 (56 Stat. 23) and particularly the authority in that Act for resort by the Administrator of the Office of Price Administration to injunctive relief under the circumstances there presented. &#167; 205 (a), 56 Stat. 33. It is also to be noted that this observation was made prior to the revision of 1948.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  A temporary injunction which merely serves to preserve the &lt;i&gt;status quo&lt;/i&gt; pending the hearing on a request for a permanent injunction is not a final order appealable under &#167;&#167; 2505.02, 2505.03 of Page's Ohio Rev. Code (1954). &lt;i&gt;May Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bailey Co.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;81&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ohio St.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;471&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 91 N. E. 183; &lt;i&gt;Tipling&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Randall Park Holding Co.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;94&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ohio App.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;505&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 114 N. E. 2d 279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  With the exception of the short-lived "Midnight Judges" Act of February 13, 1801, 2 Stat. 89 (repealed on March 8, 1802, 2 Stat. 132), the so-called federal specialties, and specific &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt; grants of jurisdiction, enforcement of federal rights was confined to the state courts prior to the Act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 470. See 13 Cornell L. Q. 499, 507-509.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  We have been referred by petitioner to decisions in the lower federal courts under 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1651 and its antecedents holding that the Court of Appeals may resort to writ of mandamus or prohibition "in aid of its jurisdiction" to prevent a district court from acting in a manner which would defeat the Court of Appeals' power of review. These decisions might be more relevant had the injunction been sought from the Court of Appeals. Only that court has power to review decisions of the Board. In any event, it has never been authoritatively suggested that this example of injunctive aid to a potential jurisdiction, which finds roots in traditional concepts of the relationship between inferior and superior courts of the same judicial system, has any relevance where the offending action sought to be enjoined is insulated by two intervening and essentially unrelated systems, one of an administrative rather than judicial nature, the other the manifestation of a distinct sovereign authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  In &lt;i&gt;W. T. Carter and Brother,&lt;/i&gt; 90 N. L. R. B. 2020, the Board has held that an employer's action in procuring a state court injunction prohibiting federally protected employee activities constitutes a violation of &#167; 8 (a) (1) of the Act which designates as an unfair labor practice an employer's restraint of employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed under &#167; 7. The Board now argues that this case is limited to situations in which the employer's resort to the state court is part of a bad faith scheme to defeat union organization and the underlying union conduct which has been enjoined is protected under the Taft-Hartley Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Section 2283 provides:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Section 1337 provides:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action or proceeding arising under any Act of Congress regulating commerce or protecting trade and commerce against restraints and monopolies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Section 265 provides:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The writ of injunction shall not be granted by any court of the United States to stay proceedings in any court of a State, except in cases where such injunction may be authorized by any law relating to proceedings in bankruptcy." 36 Stat. 1162.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;No. 48.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued March 1, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided April 4, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alan Y. Cole&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Max Schultz.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gray Thoron&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Olney, L. Paul Winings&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lorraine Wall Hurney.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*541&lt;/span&gt; MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise issue in this proceeding is whether petitioner, who filed his petition for naturalization two days before the effective date of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163, 8 U. S. C. &#167; 1101 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; may compel a final hearing on the same before the determination of deportation proceedings instituted after the effective date of the Act and based solely on grounds initiated by that Act. The "priority provision" of the Act, &#167; 318, states "no petition for naturalization shall be finally heard . . . if there is pending against the petitioner a deportation proceeding." 66 Stat. 244, 8 U. S. C. &#167; 1429.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; But petitioner claims that the savings clause of the Act, &#167; 405, 66 Stat. 280, 8 U. S. C. &#167; 1101, note, which we considered in &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Menasche, ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 528, preserves his eligibility for citizenship under prior law, and that final hearing thereon cannot be delayed by reason of the pendency of the subsequently instituted deportation action. Both the trial court, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;115&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;336&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and the Court of Appeals, 210 F. 2d 82, decided against the petitioner. We granted certiorari, 348 U. S. 811, in order to determine the relationship between &#167; 318 and &#167; 405 of the 1952 Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 1, 1952, petitioner submitted to the Immigration and Naturalization Service a preliminary application to file a petition for naturalization, Form N-400. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*542&lt;/span&gt; Following a preliminary examination, he filed his petition for naturalization on December 22, 1952, two days before the effective date of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. The prenaturalization investigation disclosed that petitioner had a criminal record; he had been convicted of grand larceny in 1913 and of manslaughter in 1915. Section 241 (a) of the 1952 Act subjects aliens to deportation if they are convicted "at any time after entry . . . of two crimes involving moral turpitude, not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct." 66 Stat. 204, 8 U. S. C. &#167; 1251 (a) (4). On June 22, 1953, a warrant of arrest was issued against petitioner, based on his 1913 and 1915 convictions, charging as grounds for deportation petitioner's presence in the country in violation of &#167; 241 (a) (4). The deportation proceedings were in progress when on July 28, 1953, petitioner, through an order to show cause filed in this case, moved to compel a final hearing on his petition for naturalization, and, in the interim, to stay the deportation proceedings. Relying on &#167; 318, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; the district judge denied the motion and the Court of Appeals affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner's main argument is that under &#167; 405 (a) nothing contained in the new Act, "unless otherwise specifically provided therein, shall be construed to affect . . . any status, condition, right in process of acquisition . . . done or existing, at the time this Act shall take effect." Petitioner was eligible for citizenship under the prior law and remains eligible under the new Act. But under the prior law petitioner was not deportable. Petitioner argues that the deportation proceeding, based solely on &#167; 241 (a) of the new Act,&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; is adversely affecting a right protected by &#167; 405 (a), to wit, his inchoate right to citizenship. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*543&lt;/span&gt; This, he claims, is in direct contravention of the terms of &#167; 405 (a) unless some other section in the Act "otherwise specifically provide[s]." Section 318, advanced as just such an exception, says "Notwithstanding the provisions of section 405 (b) . . . ," and makes no mention of &#167; 405 (a). Thus, petitioner concludes, &#167; 318 is not a specific exception to the protection afforded his rights by &#167; 405 (a), and if he is to vindicate his rights under that section he must prevail in the present proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We agree with petitioner that, absent a specific provision to the contrary, he has rights protected by &#167; 405 (a). These stem from the filing of his Form N-400, from his petition for naturalization, and, perhaps, from his fulfillment of the five-year residence requirement. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Menasche, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; But we hold that &#167; 318 specifically excepts rights under the prior law from the protection of &#167; 405 when these rights stem from a petition for naturalization or from some other step in the naturalization process.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice previous to the enactment of a priority provision in the immigration and nationality laws was for both the deportation and naturalization processes to proceed along together until either petitioner's deportation or naturalization &lt;i&gt;ipso facto&lt;/i&gt; terminated the possibility of the other occurring. See &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Waskowski,&lt;/i&gt; 158 F. 2d 962. And in the few instances where deportations were stayed in order to permit aliens to obtain a &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*544&lt;/span&gt; hearing under a recently enacted naturalization provision, the remedy was by habeas corpus after the termination of the deportation proceedings and after a stay had been denied in those proceedings. &lt;i&gt;United States ex rel. Walther&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;District Director of Immigration and Naturalization,&lt;/i&gt; 175 F. 2d 693; &lt;i&gt;Petition of Kavadias,&lt;/i&gt; 177 F. 2d 497. But as a general rule stays were not utilized, cf. &lt;i&gt;Klig&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Watkins,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/rY9/very-v-watkins/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;84&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;486&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and there ensued a race between the alien to gain citizenship and the Attorney General to deport him. If the alien was successful in forcing a final hearing and the granting of his naturalization petition, the deportation proceedings were completely nullified. To remedy this situation, the Congress incorporated &#167; 27 in the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 1015, 8 U. S. C. (1946 ed., Supp. V) &#167; 729 (c). This section prohibited naturalization or the holding of final hearings on naturalization petitions where deportation proceedings were instituted "under the provisions of this or any other Act." The 1950 Act took effect immediately and contained no savings clause, although it introduced new grounds for deportation which were to be retroactively applied. See &lt;i&gt;Galvan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Press,&lt;/i&gt; 347 U. S. 522. And in &lt;i&gt;United States ex rel. Jankowski&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Shaughnessy,&lt;/i&gt; 186 F. 2d 580, the priority provision&#151; &#167; 27&#151;was held to apply to naturalization petitions filed before the effective date of the Act, even though the deportation proceedings were commenced, as here, under the new statute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 318 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 re-enacted &#167; 27 in substantially the same form, retaining the language of its predecessor in suspending final hearings on naturalization where deportation proceedings were instituted &lt;i&gt;under this or any other Act.&lt;/i&gt; But petitioner contends that this plain language does not apply to his case because Congress did not specifically &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*545&lt;/span&gt; exempt &#167; 318 from the operation of the savings clause embodied in &#167; 405 (a), under which his inchoate right to citizenship is preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that &#167; 318 begins with the phrase "Notwithstanding the provisions of section 405 (b)," which at first glance might indicate that it was intended not to apply to &#167; 405 (a). But further analysis renders this position untenable. The same priority section had been inserted as an emergency provision in the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, and had been given immediate prospective and retroactive effect. It was carried forward almost verbatim as &#167; 318 in the 1952 Act. And to make certain that it would apply to rights existing under petitions for naturalization, the Congress added to &#167; 318 the phrase "Notwithstanding the provisions of section 405 (b)," referring to the only part of the savings clause which deals explicitly with the law applicable to naturalization petitions. The congressional purpose must have been to have &#167; 318 supersede rights stemming from such petitions, for under any other interpretation its previous approach under the 1950 law is unexplainedly reversed and the "notwithstanding" clause is rendered meaningless. It may be that the draftsmen could have been more exact in their language, since &#167; 405 (a), as well as &#167; 405 (b), embraces rights under pending petitions, see &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Menasche, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; But we think their intent is plain enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner contends that this application of &#167; 318 will have the result of affording more protection to prepetition rights of the &lt;i&gt;Menasche&lt;/i&gt;-type than to inchoate rights under a petition for naturalization itself, since the former are not embraced within &#167; 405 (b). But we do not believe &#167; 318 differentiates between these steps in the process of naturalization. Each is but part of the whole process leading to citizenship and each is subject to the provisions of &#167; 318.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*546&lt;/span&gt; Nor can we accept petitioner's argument that Congress intended &#167; 318 to apply only to deportation proceedings based on grounds existing under the prior law. In making this contention, petitioner gives away nothing and gains nothing. If the grounds for deportation are the same under the prior law as under the new Act, then nothing in the new Act &lt;i&gt;affects&lt;/i&gt; petitioner; it is clear that rights under the savings clause have not been infringed even if there is no specific exception. Only where something in the new law introduces a change, thereby affecting one's status under the old law, is the savings clause called into play. Only then is a specific exception to &#167; 405 required. Thus, if petitioner's construction were to prevail, the "notwithstanding" language in &#167; 318 would be as meaningless as under the interpretation previously advanced and rejected. The "notwithstanding" clause takes on meaning only when we assume that the new Act has made some change in the law to which the "notwithstanding" statement is noting a specific exception. That is this case.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role thus played by &#167; 405 (b) is in substantial accord with the operation of its predecessor, &#167; 347 (b) of the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1168, 8 U. S. C. (1946 ed.) &#167; 747. It was pointed out in &lt;i&gt;Menasche, supra,&lt;/i&gt; that &#167; 347 (b), with its two-year limitation, was considered to be a special limitation on the rights preserved by subsection (a) of that savings clause. The two-year period has been deleted in &#167; 405 (b), but the subsection &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*547&lt;/span&gt; remains a special limitation on the broad savings provision, bringing to bear the specific exceptions found in &#167; 318 and other provisions of the new Act whenever the protection of &#167; 405 (a) is sought for rights connected with the naturalization process.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our view, &#167; 405 (b) is the vehicle for applying each of these exceptions to the rights and liabilities emerging from naturalization proceedings under prior law and otherwise preserved by &#167; 405 (a). In using the "notwithstanding" language in these sections, Congress clearly manifested its intent that certain policies should override the otherwise broad and pervasive principle of the savings clause. In &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Menasche, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; we recognized the wide scope to be given the savings clause. We would be lax in our duty if we did not give recognition also to the congressional purpose to override the savings clause when other considerations were thought more compelling &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*548&lt;/span&gt; than the preservation of the &lt;i&gt;status quo.&lt;/i&gt; If we are not to nullify this clear legislative purpose and render meaningless the "notwithstanding" language of &#167; 318 and the other sections, we must find for the Government and hold that &#167; 318 bars petitioner's attempt to compel a hearing on his naturalization petition while the deportation proceeding is pending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The text of this provision, in material part, is as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"SEC. 318. . . . Notwithstanding the provisions of section 405 (b), and except as provided in sections 327 and 328 no person shall be naturalized against whom there is outstanding a final finding of deportability pursuant to a warrant of arrest issued under the provisions of this or any other Act; and no petition for naturalization shall be finally heard by a naturalization court if there is pending against the petitioner a deportation proceeding pursuant to a warrant of arrest issued under the provisions of this or any other Act: . . . ."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  It is assumed for the purposes of this proceeding that petitioner &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; deportable under &#167; 241 (a). See note 3, &lt;i&gt;infra.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  This is not to say that petitioner cannot challenge the authority of the Attorney General to deport him under &#167; 241 (a) of the 1952 Act. We express no opinion as to whether such a challenge, grounded on the savings clause or otherwise, might succeed if made in the deportation proceedings. Whether the question of deportability could be raised in a naturalization proceeding was expressly waived by the petitioner. See Petitioner's Brief, p. 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Petitioner's further argument, that a change in the punctuation of &#167; 318 resulted in the application of the "notwithstanding" clause to final findings of deportability but not to pending proceedings, must be rejected. When viewed against the purpose of the clause, the circumstances surrounding the controverted change, and the usual rules of proper punctuation, the contention is shown to be without substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  Section 311 provides that the right to naturalization shall not be abridged because of race, sex or marriage, and, "[n]otwithstanding section 405 (b), this section shall apply to any person whose petition for naturalization shall hereafter be filed, or shall have been pending on the effective date of this Act." 66 Stat. 239, 8 U. S. C. &#167; 1422.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 313 (a) states: "Notwithstanding the provisions of section 405 (b), no person shall hereafter be naturalized" who engages in specified subversive activities or who is a member of described subversive organizations. 66 Stat. 240, 8 U. S. C. &#167; 1424 (a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 315 (a) provides: "Notwithstanding the provisions of section 405 (b)," one who claims or has claimed his alienage and "is or was" thereby relieved of service in the armed forces, "shall be permanently ineligible to become a citizen." 66 Stat. 242, 8 U. S. C. &#167; 1426 (a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 331 (d) provides for the ending of enemy alien status and states: "Notwithstanding the provisions of section 405 (b), this subsection shall also apply to the case of any such alien whose petition for naturalization was filed prior to the effective date of this Act and which is still pending on that date." 66 Stat. 252, 8 U. S. C. &#167; 1442 (d).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This case concerns &amp;#167; 9(a) of the divorce law of the Virgin Islands:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p2"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 8 and 9 hereof,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;      if the plaintiff is within the district at the time of the      filing of the complaint and has been continuously for six      weeks immediately prior thereto, this shall be prima facie      evidence of domicile, and where the defendant has been personally served within the district or enters a      general appearance in the action, then the Court shall have      jurisdiction of the action and of the parties thereto without      further reference to domicile or to the place where the      marriage was solemnized or the cause of action arose.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p3"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The circumstances of the case and the course of the litigation are briefly stated. Petitioner filed suit for divorce because of 'irreconcilable incompatibility'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; in the District Court of the Virgin Islands on March 16, 1953. The complaint alleged that she had been a 'resident and inhabitant' of the Islands for more than six weeks prior to the commencement of the action, that respondent was not a resident of the Islands, and that the couple had no children under 21. Through Virgin Islands counsel authorized by a power of attorney executed in New York&amp;#8212;respondent entered an appearance, waived personal service, denied petitioner's allegations, and filed a 'Waiver and Consent' to 'hearing of this cause as if by default' and to 'such findings of fact and conclusions of law and decree as to the Court may seem just and reasonable.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p4"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Solely on the basis of petitioner's testimony that she had resided in the Virgin Islands continuously for 43 days before bringing suit, the Commissioner who heard the case found that she was a resident and inhabitant of the Islands and had been so for more than six weeks prior to the action. Having also found that the claimed ground for divorce was substantiated, he recommended that she be granted a divorce. On petitioner's motion to confirm the Commissioner's recommendation, the District Court inquired of petitioner's counsel whether he had 'any more evidence to offer on the question of domicile.' Since no further evidence was proffered, the court, relying on its earlier opinion in Alton v. Alton, 121 F.Supp. 878, dismissed the complaint for want of jurisdiction over petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p5"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca3/2cJo/granville-smith-v-granville-smith/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;214&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;820&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, on the basis of its decision in the Alton case, 207 F.2d 667. In that case, the Court of Appeals, likewise sitting en banc and three judges dissenting, held &amp;#167; 9(a) in violation of 'due process' guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment and the Virgin Islands Organic Act, 48 U.S.CA. &amp;#167; 1405 et seq. This Court had granted certiorari in the Alton case, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;347&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;911&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 74 S.Ct. 478, 98 L.Ed. 1068, but intervening mootness aborted disposition on the merits. &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xhk/alton-v-alton/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;347&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;610&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 74 S.Ct. 736, 98 L.Ed. 987. The obvious importance of the issue which brought the Alton case here led us to grant certiorari in this case. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;348&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;810&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 75 S.Ct. 60. In view of the lack of genuine adversary proceedings at any stage in this litigation, the outcome of which could have far-reaching consequences on domestic relations throughout the United States, the Court invited specially qualified counsel 'to appear and present oral argument as amicus curiae in support of the judgment below.' &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;348&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;885&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 75 S.Ct. 205.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p6"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;We need not consider any of the substantive questions passed on below and we intimate nothing about them. For we find that Congress did not give the Virgin Islands Legislative Assembly power to enact a law with the radiations of &amp;#167; 9(a).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p7"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Article IV, &amp;#167; 3 of the Constitution gives the Congress authority to 'make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States * * *.' Accordingly, Congress has from time to time established governments in the various territories that have come under federal control. Territorial government in the continental United States was customarily viewed as a transition step to statehood, and statehood in fact resulted. The Spanish-American War opened a new chapter. Beginning with the Treaty of Paris, the United States acquired by conquest, treaty or purchase outlying territories for which statehood was not contemplated. The position of these territories in our national scheme gave rise to lively political controversy. Answers to some of the constitutional issues that arose were unfolded in a series of decisions best formulated, perhaps, in opinions by Mr. Chief Justice White&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; and Mr. Chief Justice Taft.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p8"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;A vital distinction was made between 'incorporated' and 'unincorporated' territories.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="fn5_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; The first category had the potentialities of statehood like unto continental territories. The United States Constitution, including the Bill of Rights, fully applied to an 'incorporated' territory. See, e.g., Rassmussen v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/uBQ/rassmussen-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;197&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;516&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 25 S.Ct. 514, 49 L.Ed. 862. The second category described possessions of the United States not thought of as future States. To these only some essentials, withal undefined, of the Constitution extended. See, e.g., Balzac v. People of Porto Rico, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/vHm/balzac-v-porto-rico/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;258&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;298&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 42 S.Ct. 343, 66 L.Ed. 627. The incidence of the differentiation fell in two areas: (a) the right of the individual to trial by jury and similar protections, e.g., Balzac v. People of Porto Rico, supra; (b) the right of the Federal Government to tax territorial products on a nonuniform basis, e.g., Downes v. Bidwell, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/uoC/downes-v-bidwell/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;182&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;244&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 21 S.Ct. 770, 45 L.Ed. 1088.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p9"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The legislative power of territories has customarily been expressed as extending to 'all rightful subjects of legislation' not inconsistent with the Constitution or laws of the United States.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6" id="fn6_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; This conventional phrasing was altered to subjects of 'local application,' or 'not locally inapplicable,' in the case of unincorporated territories such as pre-Commonwealth Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn7" id="fn7_ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p10"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The questions that have arisen under grants of legislative powers to territories have fallen into three main classes: (1) those in which the sovereign immunity of the territory was in issue, e.g., People of Porto Rico v. Rosaly y Castillo, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;227&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;270&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 33 S.Ct. 352, 57 L.Ed. 507; (2) those in which conflict was claimed with the United States Constitution or laws, e.g., People of Puerto Rico v. Shell Co., &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;302&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;253&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 58 S.Ct. 167, 82 L.Ed. 235; Territory of Montana v. Lee, 2 Mont. 124; (3) those in which the 'rightful' nature of particular territorial legislation was assailed, e.g., Chuoco Tiaco v. Forbes, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/v6s/tiaco-v-forbes/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;228&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;549&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 33 S.Ct. 585, 57 L.Ed. 960; People v. Daniels, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/calctapp/enk4/people-v-daniels/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Utah&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;288&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;P.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;159&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 5 L.R.A. 444. It is the third group that is our immediate concern. In determining the rightfulness of territorial legislation the courts have considered whether a territorial legislature has transcended the familiar bounds of legislation. See, e.g., Christianson v. King County, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/viN/christianson-v-king-county/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;239&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;356&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 36 S.Ct. 114, 60 L.Ed. 327. One of the earlier questions regarding the power of territorial legislatures involved the right to pass laws applicable not generally but to specific individuals or portions of a territory. In Maynard v. Hill, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/tpr/maynard-v-hill/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;125&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;190&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 8 S.Ct. 723, 31 L.Ed. 654, this Court held that a legislative divorce granted without cause by the Oregon Territorial Legislature to a local homesteader was valid though the wife was not in the Territory and had had no notice. The Court relied on the historic practice of individual legislative divorces.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn8" id="fn8_ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; It is significant, however, that while the litigation was in progress Congress forbade territories to pass 'local' or 'special' divorce laws. 24 Stat. 170, now 48 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 1471, 48 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 1471.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The United States acquired the Virgin Islands by purchase from Denmark in 1917,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn9" id="fn9_ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt; but it was not until the Organic Act of 1936 that Congress provided a complete government&amp;#8212;including a Legislative Assembly. The OrganicAct: (1) labeled the Islands an 'insular possession' of the United States, 49 Stat. 1807, 48 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1405a, 48 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 1405a; (2) endowed the Legislative Assembly (consisting of the two pre-existing municipal councils in joint session) with power to enact laws on 'all subjects of local application not inconsistent with * * * this title or the laws of the United States made applicable to said islands, but no law shall be enacted which would impair rights existing or arising by virtue of any treaty entered into by the United States, nor shall the lands or other property of nonresidents be taxed higher than the lands or other property of residents', 49 Stat. 1811, 48 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1405r, 48 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 1405r; (3) enacted a due process clause for the Islands, 49 Stat. 1815, 48 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1406g, 48 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 1406g; and (4) gave the District Court jurisdiction over '(a)ll cases of divorce', 49 Stat. 1814, 48 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1406(4), 48 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 1406(4).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p12"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Legislative Assembly was held on a checkrein by a presidentially appointed governor who shared with the President an absolute veto over legislation. Congress had the customary reserved power to annul legislation. 49 Stat. 1810, 48 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1405o, 48 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 1405o.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p13"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;By virtue of the 1936 Organic Act, the Legislative Assembly passed the 1944 divorce law making six weeks' 'residence' by an 'inhabitant' sufficient for divorce jurisdiction.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn10" id="fn10_ref"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; In 1952, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit construed 'inhabitant' and 'residence' to imply 'domiciliary' and 'domicile.' Burch v. Burch, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca3/2b8p/burch-v-burch/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;195&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;799&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The legislature thereupon provided that six weeks' 'physical presence' was adequate as a basis for divorce. The Governor vetoed this amendment.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn11" id="fn11_ref"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt; To overcome the veto, &amp;#167; 9(a) was enacted. Bill No. 55, 17th Legislative Assembly of the Virgin Islands of the United States, 3d Sess., 1953.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p14"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Congress passed a revised Organic Act in 1954. Act of July 22, 1954, 68 Stat. 497, 48 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 1541 et seq. Previous to the legislation, this Court on June 1, had dismissed Alton v. Alton, supra, for mootness.  Though the judgment below was vacated, the Court of Appeals had expressed its views on the constitutionality of &amp;#167; 9(a). Certainly no inference favorable to its validity can be drawn from the revised Organic Act.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn12" id="fn12_ref"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p15"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In giving content to the power to pass legislation having 'local application,' two considerations at once obtrude. The phrase most liberally interpreted can be no broader than 'all rightful subjects of legislation.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn13" id="fn13_ref"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; Yet in the Organic Acts of the 'incorporated' territories, Alaska and Hawaii, there is specific limitation on divorce jurisdiction to cases where the plaintiff has resided in such territory for at least two years.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn14" id="fn14_ref"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt; 37 Stat. 514, 48 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 45, 48 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 45 (Alaska); 31 Stat. 150, 48 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 519, 48 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 519 (Hawaii). It is hardly reasonable to believe that Congress was less concerned with the scope of divorce jurisdiction in the 'unincorporated' possession of the Virgin Islands, so temptingly near the mainland, and that it intended to give them unrestricted freedom in this sensitive field of legislation. The Virgin Islands divorce law, with the exception of substantive grounds drawn from Danish law, copied that of Alaska. See Compiled Laws of the Territory of Alaska (1913) &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 1293&amp;#8212;1306; cf. Terrill v. Terrill, 2 Alaska 475; Wilson v. Wilson, 10 Alaska 616. Secondly, 'local application' obviously implies limitation to subjects having relevant ties within the territory,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn15" id="fn15_ref"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt; to laws growing out of the needs of the Islands and governing relations within them. An example is provided by People of Puerto Rico v. Shell Co., supra, which involved the validity of a territorial antitrust law. 'It requires no argument to demonstrate that a conspiracy in restraint of trade within the borders of Puerto Rico is clearly a local matter, and that it falls within the precise terms of the power granted * * *.' 302 U.S. at page 261, 58 S.Ct. at page 171. And in upholding the power of the Philippine Legislature to deport dangerous aliens, Mr. Justice Holmes, for the Court, observed that 'the local government has all civil and judicial power necessary to govern the Islands. * * * It would be strange if a government so remote should be held bound to wait for the action of Congress in a matter that might touch its life unless dealt with at once and on the sopt.' Chuoco Tiaco v. Forbes, 228 U.S. at page 557, 33 S.Ct. at page 586.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p16"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In such light the decisive question is: was &amp;#167; 9(a) concerned with the needs and interests of the local population or was it, as amicus pressed upon us, designed for export?&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn16" id="fn16_ref"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt; For the purpose of regulating divorce of Virgin Islanders, it may be abstractly relevant but practically it has no point.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn17" id="fn17_ref"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt; The Virgin Islanders could of course bring themselves within the 1944 law as interpreted in Burch v. Burch, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca3/2b8p/burch-v-burch/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;195&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;799&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. They would have no difficulty in making the appropriate showing of connection with the forum. Virgin Islanders seeking divorce are not sojourners, mere transients in the Islands. Cf. Berger v. Berger, 3 Cir., 210 F.2d 403. It hardly needs proof to read this statute as one designed for people outside the Virgin Islands. The Virgin Islands Legislative Assembly stated the purpose of &amp;#167; 9(a) with disarming frankness.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn18" id="fn18_ref"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt; It is inadmissible to assume that Congress authorized the Assembly to traffic in easy divorces for citizens of the States as a stimulus to money-making by the Islanders. What Mr. Chief Justice Taft for the Court said in another connection is strikingly applicable here: 'All others can see and understand this. How can we properly shut our minds to it?' Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co. (Child Labor Tax Case), &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/vHV/child-labor-tax-case/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;259&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 37, 42 S.Ct. 449, 450, 66 L.Ed. 817. But it sometimes helps to prove, as well as to see, the obvious.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn19" id="fn19_ref"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p17"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In 1950 the Virgin Islands had 26,665 inhabitants in its 133 square miles; for at least 20 years the population had remained relatively static, and the 1952 census estimates indicate a slight decline. In 1940, 34 divorces were granted in the Islands (1.4 per 1,000 population). In 1951 the figure had reached 312 (12.5 per 1,000). This, per capita, represented the second highest figure for any State or Territory of the United States. Moreever, the Virgin Islands far exceeded its leader, Nevada, in ratio of divorces to marriages. Nevada in 1951 had 55.7 divorces per 1,000 population but at the same time had 289.5 marriage licenses per 1,000. Thus while Nevada granted 5 marriage licenses for every divorce, the Virgin Islands was granting 4 divorces for every 3 marriages. Lest this year be considered unrepresentative, we may look to 1950 and 1952, during which the Islands granted 2 for 1 and 7 for 5 divorces over marriages respectively. Only in the Virgin Islands did divorces exceed marriages during any of the years under consideration. The national average in 1940 was 2.0 divorces and 12.1 marriages per 1,000 population. Apart from some wartime fluctuations, the ratios have been quite stable. In 1951 the average was 2.5 divorces and 10.4 marriages. Thus, while the Virgin Islands was somewhat below the national average for marriages in 1951, it was 5 times the national average for divorce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p18"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In 1952 the Virgin Islands hit its peak of divorces. Three hundred and forty-three were granted (14.3 per 1,000) as opposed to only 237 marriages. But the decisions in Alton v. Alton reduced the divorce figure to 236 in 1953, and only 111 divorces were granted between January and November of 1954.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p19"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The extraordinary rate of divorce and the disproportion between marriages and divorces raise controlling doubts of the 'local' application of &amp;#167; 9(a), especially in the context of its legislative history. Such doubts are confirmed by further inquiry. The 1950 Census reveals that only 416 widowed or divorced men and 1,105 widowed or divorced women resided in the Islands.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn20" id="fn20_ref"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; Thus the number of divorces in 1951 nearly equalled the total widowed or divorced male population of the Islands. Remarriage can serve only as a partial explanation. Petitioner's brief reveals a second surprising disproportion. Although the two components of the Islands (the Municipality of St. Croix and the Municipality of St. Thomas and St. John) are nearly equal in population, and although in 1940 St. Croix granted 18 divorces and St. Thomas and St. John 16, by 1952 St. Croix had increased only to 33, whereas St. Thomas and St. John had gone up nearly 2,000% to 310.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn21" id="fn21_ref"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt; It is not inappropriate to take judicial notice of the considerably greater tourist facilities on the Islands of St. Thomas and St. John.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn22" id="fn22_ref"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p20"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;We have no information as to the duration of residence of divorcees under the questioned law. But we are advised that contest of jurisdiction occurred in only 1% of the 310 cases concluded in St. Thomas and St. John in 1952 and that contest of the merits was no more frequent. A general appearance&amp;#8212;which strips the court of its power to inquire further into domicile&amp;#8212;but no contest as to any issue, was the practice in most cases. The clear impact of the legislation, even if we disregard the candid explanations of local political, commercial and legal sources&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn23" id="fn23_ref"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt; and the rapid drop in divorces following the initial decision of unconstitutionality, is to provide a convenient forum for prosperous persons with substantial connections to the mainland, who desire to sever their marital ties while vacationing. The Commissioner in the case at bar did not even ask petitioner where she lived in the Virgin Islands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p21"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Legislative Assembly is much less liberal toward would-be voters.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn24" id="fn24_ref"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt; One-year domicile is required. Further, a personal property or income tax on persons physically present for six weeks but with no stronger link to the Islands would no doubt be strongly challenged and of questionable validity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p22"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In the circumstances, we cannot conclude that if Congress had consciously been asked to give the Virgin Islands Legislative Assembly power to do what no State has ever attempted, it would have done so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p23"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p24"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Justice HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p25"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Justice CLARK, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice REED join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p26"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;A 'fundamental tenet of judicial review' the late Mr. Justice Jackson said, is that 'not the wisdom or policy of legislation, but only the power of the legislature, is a fit subject for consideration by the courts.' Jackson, The Struggle for Judicial Supremacy (1941), p. 81. Some 10 years later in Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xd1/harisiades-v-shaughnessy-district-director-of/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;342&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;580&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 590, 72 S.Ct. 512, 519, 96 L.Ed. 586, he added that 'judicially we must tolerate what personally we may regard as a legislative mistake.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p27"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;I must dissent here because I feel that the majority, in striking down the Virgin Islands' divorce law, is substituting its wisdom and policy for that of the Congress. I fail to see how the Virgin Islands' failure to require&amp;#8212;in form as well as substance jurisdictional requirements for divorce equal to those presently in vogue in the States is any more than a 'legislative mistake.' The Court, however, in the face of an unbroken national history of granting to our territories full authority in legislating on such subjects, declares the Islands' divorce law invalid on the ground that, rather than being 'of local application,'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1-1" id="fn1-1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; it was 'designed for export.' In so doing, the Court does violence to the command of the Congress; it overrides a long line of its own decisions, as well as the unanimous opinion in this case of the seven judges of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, each of whom has had long experience with territorial acts; and, finally, it confounds the fundamental law governing our territories which heretofore has gone unquestioned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p28"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The legislative history of the 'subjects of local application' provision, on which the Court grounds its action, shows beyond a doubt that today's construction was never dreamed of by the Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p29"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Congress first used closely similar language in 1850. The Organic Act for the Territory of New Mexico provided that 'the Constitution, and all laws of the United States which are not locally inapplicable, shall have the same force and effect within the said Territory of New Mexico as elsewhere within the United States.' (Emphasis supplied.) 9 Stat. 452. The Act also declared that the legislative power of the Territory covered 'all rightful subjects of legislation, consistent with the Constitution of the United States and the provisions of this act'. 9 Stat. 449.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p30"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Fifty years later, the Foraker Act, 31 Stat. 77, establishing a civil government for Puerto Rico, used the same 'not locally inapplicable' provision when extending the laws of the United States to that Island. With reference to the powers of the local legislature, the Act repeated this phrasing, extending the local authority to 'all matters of a legislative character not locally inapplicable * * *,'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2-1" id="fn2-1_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; 31 Stat. 83, instead of 'rightful subjects of legislation'. After the Foraker Act, the words evolved but little, until now, with the dropping of the double negative, the phrase has become 'subjects of local application'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p31"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The majority does not dispute that the legislative power of the Virgin Islands is at least on a par with that of Puerto Rico under the Foraker Act. It does, however, contend that the phrase 'of local application' represents a positive limitation on the powers of the Islands below that of a State. That the Virgin Islands has not the quantum of self-government which a State possesses is beyond question. All local laws are subject to the absolute veto shared by the appointive governor and the President of the United States. There are specific limitations on the Islands' legislative power.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3-1" id="fn3-1_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; And Congress has specifically provided that it may annul any local law. 48 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1574c, 48 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 1575. However, the Islands' divorce law has been neither vetoed nor annulled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p32"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;As the majority points out, 'the phrase (of local application) most liberally interpreted can be no broader than 'all rightful subjects of legislation." Illiberally interpreted, however, it can be no narrower. The Senate Report on the Foraker bill could not possibly be clearer in saying, with reference to the 'not locally inapplicable' phrase, that the 'legislative assembly * * * shall have complete power, subject to the veto of the governor and the supervision of Congress, to legislate upon all rightful subjects of legislation.' (Emphasis supplied.) S.Rep. No. 249, 56th Cong., 1st Sess. 3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p33"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;What then, has this Court said is the meaning of 'rightful subjects of legislation'? We note that the majority cites People v. Daniels, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/calctapp/enk4/people-v-daniels/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Utah&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;288&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;P.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;160&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, a decision by the territorial court of Utah, that the Territory was 'restricted' to 'rightful subjects of legislation'. In Cope v. Cope, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/tCa/cope-v-cope/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;137&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;682&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 684, 11 S.Ct. 222, 34 L.Ed. 832, decided the following year, this Court held 'With the exceptions noted in this section (such as 'no law shall be passed interfering with the primary disposition of the soil'), the power of the territorial legislature was apparently as plenary as that of the legislature of a state.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4-1" id="fn4-1_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p34"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Nor were the Caribbean territories placed on a footing different from that of our other possessions. The debates show that Congress was not unaware of the nature of the power it was granting to the local legislators in our Caribbean possessions. Rather than asserting that Puerto Rico had been given less power, one Congressman complained that it had been given more power than had been granted to any territory. 54 Cong.Rec. 3008 3009. Likewise, the debates on the Foraker Act and its successors indicate that the Congress thought that our Caribbean possessions had, within specific restrictions, attained self- government, 54 Cong.Rec. 3074; 53 Cong.Rec. 7478. In one of the debates, at 33 Cong.Rec. 3079, one Senator said, 'Congress, having supreme legislative power over the Territories and not being expressly restricted by the Constitution, can delegate power to local tribunals for self-government, corresponding with the powers of the States of the Union as to legislation. * * * Congress has chosen to leave Puerto Rico (and Hawaii) under the control of their local laws.' In the debates somewhat earlier, the view was expressed that there was no 'radical difference' between Puerto Rico and the other territories, 33 Cong.Rec. 3084, and that Puerto Rico was to receive local self-government, 53 Cong.Rec. 8470. The debates provide further evidence that the phrase 'of local application,' like its ancestral provisions, was not meant as a limitation on the powers of the territories. Again and again in these debates and committee reports, limitations on self-government for the territories are listed. An examination of these listings shows them to be quite complete, but nowhere does the phrase 'of local application' or its equivalent appear among them. 53 Cong.Rec. 7479; H.R.Rep.No.163, 62d Cong., 1st Sess. (with reference to Alaska). In fact, nowhere in the hundreds of pages of legislative history of the acts of Congress using this phrase does it appear that Congress ever contemplated that 'of local application' might be interpreted as a specific limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p35"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The government of our Caribbean possessions has been modified by Congress on various occasions, always definitely in the direction of more self-government. See H.R.Rep.No.461, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., 53 Cong.Rec. 7469. As is common in such enactments, a compromise is reached between those who want still greater independence and those who feel that the present degree of restriction is warranted. Yet, after exhaustive research, we have found nowhere in the debates or hearings, or in the arguments of those supporting complete self-government for the Islands, even a hint that the phrase 'of local application' represents any type of a restriction upon the local government, above and beyond our usual concepts of legislative jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p36"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;36&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In light of this study, it is difficult for me to follow the reasoning of the majority opinion. Apparently, the Court says a statute is not of local application if it is intended to reach beyond its borders, and, since the Islands' law attracts domiciliaries of other States to the Islands specifically to get divorces, it is ipso facto not 'of local application.' Under this reasoning, other laws would not be 'of local application.' Five States have divorce laws that certainly attract out-of-staters. Puerto Rico has established 'operation bootstrap,' a planned campaign to attract industry to the Island by means of tax benefits and several of the States have similar programs. Probably most clearly analogous to the Virgin Island divorce law is the corporation law of the State of Delaware, which often attracts enterprises doing no business in that State; except for incorporation there may be no contact between these companies and their 'home' State. In view of our relatively abstruse constitutional standards of legislative jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause, see Miller Bros. Co. v. State of Maryland, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xgY/miller-brothers-co-v-maryland/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;347&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;340&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 74 S.Ct. 535, 98 L.Ed. 744, it strikes me as completely unreasonable to assume that 'of local application', without the faintest indication of such in the legislative history, was meant to delegate to the Court a novel standard, equally indefinite, which it might apply on an ad hoc basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p37"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;37&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The slenderness of the reed on which the majority depends is further emphasized by the fact that in the 55 years that the 'of local application' provision has been used in describing the power of territorial legislatures it has not, so far as I can find, ever been contended in any court, in any judicial opinion, or in any law review or treatise, that the phrase represented any such limitation as the majority has placed upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p38"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;38&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What Weight Statistics?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p39"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;39&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;I assume the majority agrees that the Islands' legislature has the power to pass laws on the subject of divorce. In studying this problem, however, it seems to be impressed by the fact that the effect of this law upon the tourist trade (though I assume this too is a local enterprise) was considered of great importance. I had always thought that the courts were not to concern themselves with the motives of the legislature in exercising its powers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p40"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The majority admits that the State of Nevada hands out each year forty times as many divorces per capita as the Virgin Islands.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5-1" id="fn5-1_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; The opinion concludes, however, that the Islands are really extending their borders further than Nevada attempts, because their ratio of marriages to divorces is much lower. This approaches the perfect non sequitur. The statistics have no relevance whatever to the question before us. I feel, however, that I should point out some of the reasons for the higher ratio of marriages to divorces in Nevada. First, the Nevada divorce machinery has become so smooth that the husband-to-be often flies out to be present at the divorce, gets married in the church next door, and then accompanies his new wife to their 'new' domicile. Secondly, Nevada does a thriving business not only in divorcing out-of-staters but in marrying them as well; by requiring no waiting period before marriage, Nevada steals a march on nearby California and other States which attempt to force their often impatient residents to wait three days.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6-1" id="fn6-1_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p41"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;41&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The majority's holding that the Islands' law is not 'of local application' can be appreciated more fully by asking the question, 'What type of a divorce law would be of local application?' The majority does not pass on this, but its whole reasoning is founded on the proposition that only domicile will suffice. The law is not of local application because, 'For the purpose of regulating divorce of Virgin Islanders, it may be abstractly relevant but practically it has no point.' 75 S.Ct. at page 559. Why? Because, says the majority, 'Virgin Islanders seeking divorce are not sojourners, mere transients in the Islands.' They are domiciled in the Islands and could of course bring themselves within the 1944 law as interpreted in Burch v. Burch, 3, Cir., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca3/2b8p/burch-v-burch/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;195&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;799&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 805. They would have no difficulty in making the 'appropriate showing of connection with the forum.' It is crystal clear that any divorce law not requiring domicile will also 'be abstractly relevant but practically (will have) no point.' In fact, by definition, the only people in the Islands who are not mere 'sojourners' or 'transients' are those domiciled there. Thus the 'appropriate showing of connection with the forum' required before the law can be of other than local application is nothing other than the sacred cow of domicile. Is it any more meaningful to ask whether Congress specifically required the Islands to adhere to domicile as a basis for divorce jurisdiction, come what may, than to ask whether 'Congress authorized the Assembly to traffic in easy divorces for citizens of the States as a stimulus to money-making by the Islanders'? Congress authorized the Islands in this area to have the power of a State and thought no more about it. If the majority is willing to say that a State is restrained by the Constitution from passing such enactments, that is another story. But it has not done so. The language of Mr. Justice Brown in Cope v. Cope, supra, 137 U.S. at page 685, 11 S.Ct. at page 223, is peculiarly appropriate here: '(W)hile it is the duty of the courts to put a construction upon statutes, which shall, so far as possible, be consonant with good morals, we know of no legal principle which would authorize us to pronounce a statute of this kind, which is plain and unambiguous upon its face, void, by reason of its failure to conform to our own standard of social and moral obligations. Legislatures are as competent as courts to deal with these subjects, and, in fixing a standard of their own, are beyond our control.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p42"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What Weight Hawaii and Alaska?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p43"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;43&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;To rationalize its Procrustean treatment of the Virgin Islands Organic Act, the majority argues that, since Congress has specifically limited the divorce jurisdiction of Alaska and Hawaii to cases where the plaintiff has resided in the Territory for at least two years, it follows that the Congress must have intended similarly to limit the Islands 'so temptingly near the mainland.' This is but another non sequitur. Since 1921 the residence requirement in the Islands has never been longer than six months; the 1936 Organic Act in effect recognized and continued that requirement; three years thereafter in 1939, the residence period was reduced to six weeks; and, in the 1944 law, this new requirement was continued. Then, 10 years later, long after the 'extraordinary rate of divorce' had occurred and the controversy over the Islands' law was brought to the attention of the Congress, it adopted, in 1954, a new Organic Act which re-enacted the identical 'subjects of local application' provision of the 1936 Act. Cf. Alaska Steamship Co. v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wni/alaska-steamship-co-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;290&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 54 S.Ct. 159, 78 L.Ed. 302.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn7-1" id="fn7-1_ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p44"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;44&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Moreover, the conclusion of the Court that the two-year limitation placed on Alaska and Hawaii casts its shadow on the Islands is 'hardly reasonable.' If anything, it would be the more logical to assume the opposite&amp;#8212;that the Congress, having placed a specific requirement in the Alaskan and Hawaiian Acts and not in the subsequently passed Act for the Islands, had granted the Islands divorce jurisdiction without any such limitation. It is interesting to note the explanation of Government counsel on this point in People of Porto Rico v. Rosaly y Castillo, supra:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p45"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;45&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'That no provision similar to the one here under discussion      is contained in the organic act of Hawaii, passed at the same      session (of the Congress) is wholly without significance,      when due regard is given to the actual conditions of      Congressional draftsmanship. The two acts issued from two      different committees, and were actually drawn by different      sets of legislators. Instances, such as this case discloses,      of the lack of uniformity in similar enactments and general      want of scientific draftsmanship, are bound to present      themselves * * *.'

      &lt;p&gt;What Weight Constitutional Doubts?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p47"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;47&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;While the Court's opinion makes no reference to any constitutional doubts, these may have motivated it in striking down the Islands' law on the statutory ground. In my opinion this may be an explanation but it is not an excuse. There are limits to which the Court should not run to escape a constitutional adjudication. Admittedly, the doubt that domicile is not a constitutional requirement is not free from doubters. Even though judge-made, it does involve a peculiarly sensitive area of American life. Nevertheless, the Virgin Islands are entitled to a forthright adjudication on their statute&amp;#8212;not one by a phantom escape clause.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p48"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;48&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The constitutional questions presented on brief and at argument involve the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Full Faith and Credit Clause, and the Tenth Amendment. First of all, neither of the Granville-Smiths claims to have been deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. While the State has an interest in the marital relationship, certainly this interest does not come within the protection of the Due Process Clause. Likewise, full faith and credit is not applicable. Mrs. Granville-Smith is not asking that this Court make her divorce, if granted, valid in the States. That issue is not here and may never be. All she asks is that the Islands be permitted to proceed under their own law. In this connection, I find no words in the Constitution which require a Territory to give full faith and credit to the laws of a State.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p49"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;49&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Nor have the Islands invaded the sphere of activities reserved to the States, contrary to the Tenth Amendment. The 'Tenth Amendment 'does not operate as a limitation upon the powers, express or implied, delegated to the national government." Case v. Bowles, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wZ6/case-v-bowles/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;327&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;92&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 102, 66 S.Ct. 438, 443, 90 L.Ed. 552. The Congress has the power to deal with the Islands, granting or withholding from them the powers of a State as it sees fit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p50"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The only constitutional bugaboo is a judge-made one, domicile.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn8-1" id="fn8-1_ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; It creates strange anomalies. A married couple, both of whom desire a divorce, can obtain one in Nevada merely by having one spouse 'reside' there uninterruptedly for six weeks, and claim an intention to take up permanent residence there. See, e.g., Business Week, July 14, 1945, p. 24. Then, after divorce, though the divorcee immediately leaves Nevada, as was always intended, both sides here concede that regardless of how evident it is there was no domicile in the divorcing State, no other State can question the validity of the divorce so long as both parties appeared in the action. See Johnson v. Muelberger, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xb3/johnson-v-muelberger/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;340&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;581&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 71 S.Ct. 474, 95 L.Ed. 552. We too agree with the language of Mr. Chief Justice Taft: 'All others can see and understand this. How can we properly shut our minds to it?'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn9-1" id="fn9-1_ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt; Child Labor Tax Case (Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co.) &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/vHV/child-labor-tax-case/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;259&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 37, 42 S.Ct. 449, 450, 66 L.Ed. 817. Still the Court strikes down the Islands' law which avoids this judicial fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p51"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;51&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Divorce is an intensely practical matter, and if a husband and wife domiciled in any State want a divorce enough, we all know that they can secure it in several of our States. This being true, I see no sense in striking down the Islands' law. There is no virtue in a state of the law the only practical effect of which would be to make New Yorkers fly 2,400 miles over land to Reno instead of 1,450 miles over water to the Virgin Islands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p52"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;52&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The only vice of the Virgin Islands' statute, in an uncontested case like this, is that it makes unnecessary a choice between bigamy and perjury. I think the Court should not discourage this and I would reverse.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, the islands are not yet economically self-supporting. Hence it has been necessary to provide for an amount of Federal control over local affairs commensurate with continuing expenditures of Federal funds to subsidize the local government. * * * Matters of purely local concern are placed within local legislative power.

        &lt;p&gt; Of course a suit for damages brought by a resident of the Virgin Islands for an injury occurring on the mainland, or a suit against a defendant served in the Virgin Islands arising out of a commercial transaction connecting both the Virgin Islands and the mainland, would clearly contain a relevant tie amply affording jurisdiction to the courts of the Virgin Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; We are dealing here with the bearing of the statute on consensual divorces. So far as these are concerned &amp;#167; 9(a) is an entirety, for in its application the first part of the section accomplishes precisely the same thing as the second. Under our system of law a judge is not charged with the role of an adversary party, and as such called upon to assume responsibility for rebutting a statutory presumption.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; Three members of the Legislative Assembly addressed themselves to the reasons for changing the result of the Court of Appeals in Burch v. Burch, see 75 S.Ct. at page 557, supra.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mr. Rohlsen spoke with authority as member in charge of the bill: 'The divorce business in the Virgin Islands is quite a thriving business. I understand that this business provides quite an income for the municipalities since it is estimated that over $300,000 a year is spent within the Virgin Islands by persons who have been using the facilities of our divorce law to put their homes in order. Unfortunately, because of an error in the draft of original law * * * and because of the Governor's attitude * * * it now becomes necessary for us to consider another amendment which is designed to enhance this u-coming (sic) business in the islands. * * * I am not trying to speak for or against the moral ethics of divorce because, as far as I am concerned, those issues were denied when the statute was enacted (sic) making it possible for people to come here for divorces. * * * I consider this matter as a means of enhancing the economy of our islands. * * *'&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'The people of the Virgin Islands have enjoyed great financial benefits by an influx of people to these islands for the purpose of getting divorced. * * * I recommend to my colleagues this piece of legislation for their favorable consideration inasmuch as they can see the disadvantage in which the municipalities have been placed by not having the divorce court functioning at the present time.' Proceedings and Debates, 17th Legislative Assembly of the Virgin Islands of the United States, 3d Sess., 1953, pp. 46&amp;#8212;47, 66&amp;#8212;67.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Moving adoption of the earlier version of &amp;#167; 9(a), which the Governor vetoed but which does not, so far as concerns our problem, differ from &amp;#167; 9(a), Mr. Richards stated: '* * * personally I do not see why this Assembly should be deliberating so extensively on this amendment. Only about 2% of the divorces heard and the decisions rendered in the District Courts affect the residents of the Virgin Islands. I should conclude that this law was enacted not to facilitate the bona fide residents of the Virgin Islands but in order to provide as it were source of economic asset to the islands by which people are brought to our shores and contribute to the general economic welfare of the islands. * * * I feel proud to see that only a possible of 2 or three residents of the Virgin Islands are involved in divorce cases a year.' Proceedings and Debates, 17th Legislative Assembly of the Virgin Islands of the United States, 2d Sess., 1953, p. 10.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mr. Heywood, in discussing the earlier amendment, observed: 'This bill No. 54 before us today appears to be in my opinion, a devise (sic) aimed primarily at transients in the islands. * * * I am very well aware of the volume of divorce business being carried on in these islands. * * * I have heard that there is anticipated a half a million dollars-business in this current year which will be distributed among lawyers, hotel bills, taxi cabs and other business ventures in the Community.'

        &lt;p&gt; The words of the Organic Act, however, appear to require that local laws merely be on 'subjects of local application'. Divorce, it seems to me, is such a subject.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What is the Legislative History?&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; Rather than interpreting this as a greater restriction, it would seem more reasonable to me to assume that the Congress, in repeating these words, meant that the legislature, within the specific limitations laid down in the Organic Act, was to exercise the same type of power as Congress could for the Territory, subject, of course, to the power of the Congress. This view is supported by the Government's argument in People of Puerto Rico v. Shell Co., &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;302&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;253&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 58 S.Ct. 167, 82 L.Ed. 235, cited by the majority: 'The broad grant to a territorial legislature of 'all local legislative power' in the Territory, to 'extend to all matters of a legislative character not locally inapplicable,' in language such as, or similar to, that used in the Organic Act for Puerto Rico, taken in connection with the other provisions of an organic act establishing, as in Puerto Rico, an organized territorial government in accordance with the American system, with legislative, executive, and judicial powers, confers (with the exceptions specifically stated in the Organic Act) as plenary local legislative power upon the territorial legislature as that habitually exercised by the legislature of a State.'

        &lt;p&gt; Nevada's yearly average is about 9,000; the Islands' highest total is 343, and its 5-year average is about 200.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; This arrangement has taken so many nuptials to Nevada that the marriage trade has also become a very lucrative business. So good, in fact, that Nevada's legislature has recently found it necessary to settle a squabble between local officials as to who might perform the marriage ceremony. See Reno Evening Gazette, March 21, 1955, p. 11, col. 3; March 23, p. 11, col. 6.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What Law Would Be 'Of Local Application'?&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; In addition to all this, I believe the re-enactment by Congress of this provision in 1954 is entitled to extra weight. When the Organic Act came up before Congress, the Third Circuit had construed it to permit the Virgin Islands' divorce law. Nor does the fact that the majority in the Third Circuit held the Virgin Islands' law invalid on other grounds change the weight to be given to the re-enactment. Any lawyer would know that, on the constitutional grounds relied on by the one-judge majority, the Supreme Court was just as likely to disagree as to agree. In the not improbable case that the Court held the Virgin Islands' enactment constitutional, a small change in the Organic Act would be the only way of preventing the operation of this Insular 'Pied Piper.' Yet Congress made no such change. As Chief Justice Stone said dissenting in Girouard v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x12/girouard-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;328&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;61&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 75, 76, 66 S.Ct. 826, 833, 90 L.Ed. 1084, 'In any case it is not lightly to be implied that Congress * * * has delegated to this Court the responsibility of giving new content to language deliberately readopted'.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn8-1"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn8-1_ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Even this is being fast undone and 'English courts may now grant divorces in many cases where the parties are not domiciled in England.' See 65 Harv.L.Rev. 193, 200. See also Crownover v. Crownover, 1954, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/nm/7viT/crownover-v-crownover/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;58&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;N.M.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;597&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 274 P.2d 127.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; An article on the Nevada divorce in a popular magazine shows that the people have not closed their minds even if this Court has. 'Nevada's first requirement for a divorce is what lawyers smugly refer to as a 'legal fiction': six weeks' steady residence in Nevada. * * * After this a mild sort of perjury is committed when the applicant mumbles in reply to the judge's mumble, that she does intend to continue residence in Nevada.' Holiday, February 1949, p. 98.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three petitioners, dining car employees, filed separate suits in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, against the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co. They sued under the Federal Employers' Liability Act for injuries received upon the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*30&lt;/span&gt; derailment of one of defendant's trains near Dillon, South Carolina. The defendant filed motions to dismiss or, in the alternative, to transfer the cases to the Florence Division of the Eastern District of South Carolina. The District Court denied the motions to dismiss and granted the motions to transfer under 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1404 (a).&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit had held, in &lt;i&gt;All States Freight&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Modarelli,&lt;/i&gt; 196 F. 2d 1010, that the order for transfer was not appealable, the petitioners filed applications for mandamus or prohibition to the district judge in order to require him to set aside his orders of transfer. The Court of Appeals denied the applications, and we granted certiorari. 348 U. S. 870.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases of the three petitioners present identical questions of law, were consolidated for argument here, and will be disposed of in this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district judge in granting the motions to transfer stated that if he had been free to construe &#167; 1404 (a) as he did in the case of &lt;i&gt;Naughton&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pennsylvania R. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/paed/9eqm/naughton-v-pennsylvania-r-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;85&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;761&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, he would have denied the transfers because, in his view, it called for an application of the stricter rule of &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens&lt;/i&gt; as recognized in decisions of this Court. See &lt;i&gt;Gulf Oil Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gilbert,&lt;/i&gt; 330 U. S. 501. But since the &lt;i&gt;Naughton&lt;/i&gt; case, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit had held, in &lt;i&gt;All States Freight&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Modarelli, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; that the district judge had a broader discretion in the application of the statute than under the doctrine of &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens.&lt;/i&gt; The district judge, therefore, followed the rule laid down in the &lt;i&gt;All States Freight&lt;/i&gt; case, &lt;i&gt;supra.&lt;/i&gt; We think the Court of Appeals correctly rejected the narrower doctrine of &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens&lt;/i&gt; and properly construed the statute. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*31&lt;/span&gt; As Judge Goodrich, speaking for the court, appropriately pointed out, at p. 1011:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens&lt;/i&gt; doctrine is quite different from Section 1404 (a). That doctrine involves the dismissal of a case because the forum chosen by the plaintiff is so completely inappropriate and inconvenient that it is better to stop the litigation in the place where brought and let it start all over again somewhere else. It is quite naturally subject to careful limitation for it not only denies the plaintiff the generally accorded privilege of bringing an action where he chooses, but makes it possible for him to lose out completely, through the running of the statute of limitations in the forum finally deemed appropriate. Section 1404 (a) avoids this latter danger. Its words should be considered for what they say, not with preconceived limitations derived from the &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens&lt;/i&gt; doctrine."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Maris, who was Chairman of the Judicial Conference Committee on the revision of the Code and approved the text submitted to Congress, sat on the Court of Appeals &lt;i&gt;en banc&lt;/i&gt; when &lt;i&gt;All States Freight&lt;/i&gt; was decided. And Judge Parker of the Fourth Circuit, consultant to the Advisory Committee, writing for the court in &lt;i&gt;Jiffy Lubricator Co., Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Stewart-Warner Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 177 F. 2d 360, 362, also construed the statute as we understand it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;". . . A dismissal in application of that [&lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens&lt;/i&gt;] or any other principle puts an end to the action and hence is final and appealable. An order transferring it to another district does not end but preserves it as against the running of the statute of limitations and for all other purposes. The notion that 28 U. S. C. A. &#167; 1404 (a) was a mere codification of existing law relating to forum non conveniens is erroneous. It is perfectly clear that the purpose of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*32&lt;/span&gt; this section of the Revised Judicial Code was to grant broadly the power of transfer for the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, whether dismissal under the doctrine of forum non conveniens would have been appropriate or not."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See also Moore, Commentary on the Judicial Code (1949 ed.), p. 208.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Congress adopted &#167; 1404 (a), it intended to do more than just codify the existing law on &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens.&lt;/i&gt; As this Court said in &lt;i&gt;Ex parte Collett,&lt;/i&gt; 337 U. S. 55-61, Congress, in writing &#167; 1404 (a), which was an entirely new section, was revising as well as codifying. The harshest result of the application of the old doctrine of &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens,&lt;/i&gt; dismissal of the action, was eliminated by the provision in &#167; 1404 (a) for transfer. When the harshest part of the doctrine is excised by statute, it can hardly be called mere codification. As a consequence, we believe that Congress, by the term "for the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice," intended to permit courts to grant transfers upon a lesser showing of inconvenience. This is not to say that the relevant factors have changed or that the plaintiff's choice of forum is not to be considered, but only that the discretion to be exercised is broader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is conceded by the petitioners that if the district judge was correct in exercising his discretion to transfer these cases under &#167; 1404 (a) without regard to the stringent requirements of &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens,&lt;/i&gt; then the Court of Appeals properly denied the applications for mandamus and prohibition. Since we agree that the district judge correctly construed the statute in evaluating the evidence, we do not find it necessary to detail the facts considered by him in reaching his judgment. It was correct in law and warranted by the facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*33&lt;/span&gt; Since we find that the district judge properly construed &#167; 1404 (a), it is unnecessary to pass upon the question of whether mandamus or prohibition is a proper remedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE CLARK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concur, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under this judgment, Alexander Norwood, who lives in Philadelphia where he filed this suit for damages against the railroad, will have to go to South Carolina if he wishes to prosecute it. Joseph Tunstall and John Smallwood, both of whom live in Washington, D. C., will likewise have to go all the way to South Carolina if they hope to recover any damages against the railroad. All three allegedly suffered permanent injuries when a passenger train on which they were employed was derailed. The derailment, with which the plaintiffs had no connection whatever, is sufficient in itself to support a finding of negligence. See &lt;i&gt;Jesionowski&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Boston &amp;amp; Maine R. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 329 U. S. 452. Despite these circumstances, the district judge deprived Norwood of a trial in his home town, and Tunstall and Smallwood of one within 150 miles of theirs. This Court's decision, sustaining that result, sends the case to South Carolina, perhaps preventing it from ever being prosecuted because of the financial condition of the plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is thought justified by an interpretation of &#167; 1404 (a) of the 1948 revision of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1404 (a). It provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*34&lt;/span&gt; As words on a page torn from the history of our judicial development, this direction is utterly meaningless. How great must be the inconvenience before a judge could feel justified in ordering a transfer? When would it be "in the interest of justice" to do so? It is not difficult to imagine the baffled reactions of our judiciary were this mandate not accompanied by some explanation, were it not preceded by some experience in dealing with pleas to decline suits because of inconvenience and injustice. Compare the groupings of this Court and the remainder of the federal judiciary when confronted with the blank pages presented by the celebrated &#167; 301 of Taft-Hartley. See &lt;i&gt;Association of Westinghouse Salaried Employees&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Westinghouse Electric Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 348 U. S. 437.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, fortunately, the command of &#167; 1404 (a) is accompanied by both history and explanation. The Reviser's Notes state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Subsection (a) was drafted in accordance with the doctrine of forum non conveniens, permitting transfer to a more convenient forum, even though the venue is proper. As an example of the need of such a provision, see Baltimore &amp;amp; Ohio R. Co. v. Kepner, 1941, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;62&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;S. Ct.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 314 U. S. 44, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;86&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;L. Ed.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which was prosecuted under the Federal Employer's Liability Act in New York, although the accident occurred and the employee resided in Ohio. The new subsection requires the court to determine that the transfer is necessary for convenience of the parties and witnesses, and further, that it is in the interest of justice to do so."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal courts, in exercising their discretion under this provision, are thus not set adrift on an uncharted sea, to order transfers according to their personal notions of justice. They are explicitly referred to the body of doctrine in Anglo-American law known as &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*35&lt;/span&gt; a doctrine which was certainly well developed at the time of the passage of the new Code. Indeed, shortly before the revision was introduced in Congress, this Court handed down two decisions setting forth the considerations which should govern the exercise of the trial judge's discretion. &lt;i&gt;Gulf Oil Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gilbert,&lt;/i&gt; 330 U. S. 501; &lt;i&gt;Koster&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 330 U. S. 518. These opinions clearly evinced the attitude with which these matters should be approached, the standard to be applied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is often said that the plaintiff may not, by choice of an inconvenient forum, `vex,' `harass,' or `oppress' the defendant by inflicting upon him expense or trouble not necessary to his own right to pursue his remedy. But unless the balance is strongly in favor of the defendant, the plaintiff's choice of forum should rarely be disturbed." &lt;i&gt;Gulf Oil Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 330 U. S., at 508.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Where there are only two parties to a dispute, there is good reason why it should be tried in the plaintiff's home forum if that has been his choice. He should not be deprived of the presumed advantages of his home jurisdiction except upon a clear showing of facts which either (1) establish such oppressiveness and vexation to a defendant as to be out of all proportion to plaintiff's convenience, which may be shown to be slight or nonexistent, or (2) make trial in the chosen forum inappropriate because of considerations affecting the court's own administrative and legal problems. In any balancing of conveniences, a real showing of convenience by a plaintiff who has sued in his home forum will normally outweigh the inconvenience the defendant may have shown." &lt;i&gt;Koster,&lt;/i&gt; 330 U. S., at 524.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*36&lt;/span&gt; There was a direct reference to the &lt;i&gt;Koster&lt;/i&gt; decision in hearings before the Senate Committee considering the 1948 Code. Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on H. R. 3214, 80th Cong., 2d Sess. 73-74.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic issue in this case is whether the district judge should exercise his discretion in the light of these opinions, and in the light of &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens&lt;/i&gt; doctrine generally (of which these Supreme Court decisions are a particularization), or whether &#167; 1404 (a) expands the range of his discretion to an as yet unstated degree, and removes these decisions and other &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens&lt;/i&gt; cases as guiding precedents. The Courts of Appeals have divided on the issue. With the opinions cited by the majority, compare &lt;i&gt;Ford Motor Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ryan,&lt;/i&gt; 182 F. 2d 329; &lt;i&gt;Nicol&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Koscinski,&lt;/i&gt; 188 F. 2d 537; &lt;i&gt;Wiren&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Laws,&lt;/i&gt; 90 U. S. App. D. C. 105, 194 F. 2d 873. But see &lt;i&gt;Amalgamated Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Southern Bus Lines,&lt;/i&gt; 172 F. 2d 946, 948. The section itself is merely a restatement, in very generalized form, of the considerations thought to govern the question of &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens.&lt;/i&gt; The particular words or their equivalents recur in the cases and literature on the subject.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The Reviser's Notes repeat these factors and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*37&lt;/span&gt; refer explicitly to &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens.&lt;/i&gt; Ordinarily, these considerations, standing alone, would afford cogent grounds for finding that the old doctrine was to continue as the prevailing rule. This Court said as much in &lt;i&gt;Ex parte Collett,&lt;/i&gt; 337 U. S. 55, 56, when it posed the issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In this case we must decide whether the venue provisions of the Judicial Code &lt;i&gt;render applicable&lt;/i&gt; the doctrine of &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens&lt;/i&gt; to actions under the Federal Employers' Liability Act." (Emphasis supplied.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We held the doctrine was applicable to such cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now it is argued that since &#167; 1404 (a) has changed the judicial response to the inconvenient forum, providing for transfer rather than dismissal, the trial judge may exercise a broader discretion than was permissible under the old rule. The opinion of the Court, adopting this view, goes far toward assigning to the trial judge the choice of forums, a prerogative which has previously rested with the plaintiff. In so doing, the majority completely ignores the judicial and legislative background of &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens&lt;/i&gt; in cases arising under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 6 of the FELA was amended in 1910 to permit suits to be brought "in the district of the residence of the defendant, or in which the cause of action arose, or in which the defendant shall be doing business at the time &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*38&lt;/span&gt; of commencing" the action. 36 Stat. 291, as amended, 45 U. S. C. &#167; 56. We held that the congressional purpose manifested by this provision precluded the application of &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens&lt;/i&gt; to suits under the Act. &lt;i&gt;Baltimore &amp;amp; Ohio R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kepner,&lt;/i&gt; 314 U. S. 44; &lt;i&gt;Miles&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Illinois Central R. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 315 U. S. 698. Agitation in Congress to limit venue under the FELA culminated in the attempted passage of the Jennings Bill, H. R. 1639, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.; the bill passed the House by a narrow margin, 93 Cong. Rec. 9193-9194, only to die in the Senate. But the 1948 revision of the Judicial Code, characterized by its legislative leaders as a noncontroversial revision and codification, see &lt;i&gt;Ex parte Collett, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 62, was held to overturn the &lt;i&gt;Kepner&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Miles&lt;/i&gt; decisions and make &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens&lt;/i&gt; applicable to actions under the FELA. In applying &#167; 1404 (a) to FELA cases, this Court said in &lt;i&gt;Collett:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Code, therefore, does not repeal &#167; 6 of the Federal Employers' Liability Act. We agree with petitioner that Congress had no such intention, as demonstrated by its failure to list the section in the meticulously prepared schedule of statutes repealed. We cannot agree that the order before us effectuates an implied repeal. The inapplicability of &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens&lt;/i&gt; to Liability Act suits derives from the &lt;i&gt;Kepner&lt;/i&gt; decision. . . . Congress chose to remove its judicial gloss via another statute." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 60-61.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removal of the "judicial gloss" would merely repeal the &lt;i&gt;Kepner&lt;/i&gt; doctrine and thus make FELA suits, along with any civil action, subject to &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens.&lt;/i&gt; This Court asserted just that in &lt;i&gt;Pope&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 379, 383:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We have heretofore held that &#167; 1404 (a) makes &lt;i&gt;the doctrine of forum non conveniens applicable to&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*39&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Federal Employers' Liability Act cases&lt;/i&gt; brought in federal courts and provides for the transfer of such actions to a more convenient forum. &lt;i&gt;Ex Parte Collett,&lt;/i&gt; 337 U. S. 55 (1949)." (Emphasis supplied.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again in &lt;i&gt;Kerotest Mfg. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;C-O-Two Fire Equipment Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 342 U. S. 180, 186, we said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"And if the manufacturer is joined as an unwilling defendant in a &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens,&lt;/i&gt; he has available upon an appropriate showing the relief provided by &#167; 1404 (a) of the Judicial Code. 62 Stat. 869, 937, 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1404 (a)."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as late as 1953, JUSTICES JACKSON, BLACK, and MINTON, dissenting in &lt;i&gt;Wells&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Simonds Abrasive Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 514, 522, made this statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"28 U. S. C. &#167; 1404 (a) authorizes certain transfers of any civil action from state to state for the convenience of witnesses or of parties, or in the interests of justice. &lt;i&gt;The purpose was to adopt for federal courts the principles of forum non conveniens. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ex Parte Collett,&lt;/i&gt; 337 U. S. 55. These are broad and imprecise and involve such considerations as the state of the court's docket. &lt;i&gt;Gulf Oil Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gilbert,&lt;/i&gt; 330 U. S. 501." (Emphasis supplied.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these cases is even mentioned by the majority. In each is implicit the principle that &#167; 1404 (a) embodies the doctrine of &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens;&lt;/i&gt; in each there is the uniform understanding of members of this Court that the language of &#167; 1404 (a) is merely a paraphrase of that rule. Instead, the majority applies a variation of the old Jennings Bill, which Congress refused to adopt at the same session in which it inserted &#167; 1404 (a) into the new Code. There is certainly nothing even remotely connected with the enactment of &#167; 1404 (a) to indicate that when the section and the Reviser's Notes referred &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*40&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens&lt;/i&gt;&#151;particularly as articulated in the then-recent &lt;i&gt;Gulf Oil&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Koster&lt;/i&gt; cases&#151;they meant the Jennings Bill or anything like it. Still the majority adopts a slight modification of that rejected provision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much is made of the fact that there is no legislative record of opposition to the adoption of &#167; 1404 (a). This, if true, is explained by the fact that the Reviser's Notes, as well as Congress' refusal to adopt the Jennings Bill, may well have lulled any opposition into a false feeling of security. The statements in &lt;i&gt;Gulf Oil&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Koster&lt;/i&gt; that the plaintiff's choice could be disturbed only if "the balance is strongly in favor of the defendant" and that this "rarely" is the case, together with the defeat of the Jennings Bill, is certainly sufficient evidence that Congress had no intention of seriously interfering with an FELA plaintiff's choice of forum. In this connection, we note the emphasis in &lt;i&gt;Collett,&lt;/i&gt; 337 U. S., at 64, on the difference between the Jennings Bill and &#167; 1404 (a); this is narrowed considerably if we permit a larger discretion in the district judge than was available under &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is said that we must uphold a clear change in the statute made by the Congress. We certainly agree. But the language of &#167; 1404 (a), considered against the background of judicial discussion in this area, could mean nothing but the doctrine of &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens,&lt;/i&gt; and the Reviser's Notes state that the purpose of the change was to apply &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens&lt;/i&gt; rules to the transfer of civil cases in the federal courts. The direction of Congress is clear and unmistakable. Our duty is so to interpret &#167; 1404 (a), not to expand and enlarge upon it. Changes of this type should be made by the legislative branch. And the fact that Congress has through codification extended a previously recognized procedure to civil cases generally, with one slight change (&lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; transfer rather than dismissal), does not give this Court &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*41&lt;/span&gt; a blank check to recast the underlying law to suit its fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concluding that the prior tenets of &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens&lt;/i&gt; apply, embracing the standards laid down in &lt;i&gt;Gulf Oil&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Koster,&lt;/i&gt; we cannot help but agree with the district judge that his discretion would have been exercised differently in the instant case if he had applied the law of those decisions. Without detailing all the facts here involved, we note that one of the plaintiffs resided in the district where this suit was brought. Under the usual &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens&lt;/i&gt; approach, this would virtually suffice, in and of itself, to preclude a refusal to retain the case for trial. See Blair, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 413; Braucher, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 916-917, 919; Dainow, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 880. After all, the &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens&lt;/i&gt; situation generally envisaged is one involving a foreign cause of action &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; nonresident parties. See Blair, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 34; Foster, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 53. Apparently but one jurisdiction stands squarely behind the proposition that a court may decline to hear a personal injury suit, brought by a &lt;i&gt;bona fide&lt;/i&gt; resident, in order to spare the defendant inconvenience and expense. &lt;i&gt;Williamson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;North-Eastern R. Co., supra.&lt;/i&gt; That is the law in Scotland, a jurisdiction long noted for its distinctive doctrines in this area.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Forum non conveniens&lt;/i&gt; has &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*42&lt;/span&gt; no such impact in this country, and, in fact, &lt;i&gt;Koster&lt;/i&gt; may be regarded as an extreme decision in depriving a plaintiff of his home forum.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; With this the state of the law, both now and in 1948 when the Code was adopted, we certainly should require a more explicit direction from Congress before depriving an injured party of his privilege under the FELA of bringing suit in his own district &#151;at least when the standards of &lt;i&gt;Koster&lt;/i&gt; have not been applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district judge admitted that he had not exercised his discretion in light of &lt;i&gt;Koster&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gulf Oil,&lt;/i&gt; the applicable decisions of this Court; he felt bound by a contrary decision of the Court of Appeals. He indicated very clearly that his decision would have been otherwise if he were free to follow the opinions we consider controlling. We should reverse and give the trial judge an opportunity to exercise his discretion under the proper standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is one of considerable importance in the administration of the lower federal courts, and, considering the inadequacy of appeal, should be settled in this case if it is to be settled at all in the near future. Every appellate court which has passed on &#167; 1404 (a) implicitly recognizes the necessity for settling issues of law under &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*43&lt;/span&gt; the section. Even those courts which have refused relief, expressing the view that mandamus is an inappropriate remedy, have gone on to discuss the merits of the question presented. &lt;i&gt;In re Josephson,&lt;/i&gt; 218 F. 2d 174; &lt;i&gt;All States Freight, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Modarelli,&lt;/i&gt; 196 F. 2d 1010; cf. &lt;i&gt;Jiffy Lubricator Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Stewart-Warner Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 177 F. 2d 360. The Court's opinion in this case, by reserving the mandamus issue, follows the same course. We note, further, that the majority of Court of Appeals decisions dealing with &#167; 1404 (a) find mandamus appropriate in circumstances less compelling than these. &lt;i&gt;Ford Motor Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ryan, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Davis,&lt;/i&gt; 185 F. 2d 766; &lt;i&gt;Shapiro&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bonanza Hotel Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 185 F. 2d 777; &lt;i&gt;Wiren&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Laws, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chicago, R. I. &amp;amp; P. R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Igoe,&lt;/i&gt; 212 F. 2d 378; cf. &lt;i&gt;Nicol&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Koscinski, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would reverse and direct that the transfer application be determined under &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens,&lt;/i&gt; and particularly the &lt;i&gt;Gulf Oil&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Koster&lt;/i&gt; decisions. The answer to the majority's contention that this would unduly curtail a desirable reform is simply that this dispute involves not merely "forum shopping," but the whittling away by judicial interpretation of the privileges and benefits of working men under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. The battle over the scope of their rights should be fought out in the Congress&#151;as it was in the case of the Jennings Bill&#151;and not in the courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reviser's Notes say that &#167; 1404 (a) goes no further than &lt;i&gt;forum non conveniens.&lt;/i&gt; That was what Congress acted upon, not the private opinion of some of the members of the Reviser's Committee. These distinguished participants may have thought their reform went beyond &lt;i&gt;Collett.&lt;/i&gt; If so, they should have communicated their thought to the Congress where the final responsibility rests.&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Theodore G. Schirmeyer&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mark Martin&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioners. On the brief were &lt;i&gt;Mr. Schirmeyer, Hobert Price&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Alexander Gullett.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Edward B. Hayes&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leonard J. Matteson&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ezra G. Benedict Fox&lt;/i&gt; filed a brief for the American Institute of Marine Underwriters, as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae,&lt;/i&gt; urging affirmance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*311&lt;/span&gt; MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case raises questions concerning the power of States to regulate the terms and conditions of marine insurance contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glenn, Frank and Henry Wilburn, merchants in Denison, Texas, bought a small houseboat to use for commercial carriage of passengers on nearby Lake Texoma, an artificial inland lake between Texas and Oklahoma. The respondent Fireman's Fund Insurance Company insured the boat against loss from fire and other perils. While moored on the lake the boat was destroyed by fire. Following respondent's refusal to pay for the loss, this suit was brought in a Texas state court by the Wilburns and by their wholly owned corporation, the Wilburn Boat Company, to which the boat's legal title had been transferred. After removal of the case to the United States District Court because of diversity, respondent answered admitting issuance of the policy, payment of premiums and destruction of the boat. Liability was denied however because of alleged breaches of printed policy terms or "warranties" providing that, without written consent of the company, the boat could not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, hired or chartered, and must be used solely for private pleasure purposes.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The case was submitted on stipulated facts supplemented by oral testimony. Contending that the evidence showed the policy contract to have been made and delivered in Texas, petitioners urged that all questions concerning &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*312&lt;/span&gt; alleged policy breaches were controlled by Texas law. If Texas law does govern, the policy provision against pledging may be wholly invalid.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Furthermore no breach by the insured of the provisions of a fire insurance policy is a defense to any suit under Texas law unless the breach contributes to the loss.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Without finding whether the policy had been made and delivered in Texas, the court refused to give that State's law any effect at all, holding that since a marine policy is a maritime contract, federal admiralty law&#151;not state law&#151;governed.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; The court went on to hold that there is an established admiralty rule which requires literal fulfillment of every policy warranty so that any breach bars recovery, even though a loss would have happened had the warranty been carried out to the letter. Finding that the Wilburns had breached policy provisions against transfer, pledge and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*313&lt;/span&gt; use of the boat,&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; the District Court entered judgment for the insurance company. Approving the District Court's actions in all respects, the Court of Appeals affirmed, saying that "It is the settled doctrine that a marine contract of insurance is `derived from' is `governed by', and is a `part of' the general maritime law of the world." 201 F. 2d 833, 837. Importance of the questions involved prompted us to grant certiorari. 347 U. S. 950.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the insurance policy here sued on is a maritime contract the Admiralty Clause of the Constitution brings it within federal jurisdiction. &lt;i&gt;Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dunham,&lt;/i&gt; 11 Wall. 1. But it does not follow, as the courts below seemed to think, that every term in every maritime contract can only be controlled by some federally defined admiralty rule. In the field of maritime contracts&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; as in that of maritime torts,&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; the National Government has left much regulatory power in the States. As later &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*314&lt;/span&gt; discussed in more detail, this state regulatory power, exercised with federal consent or acquiescence, has always been particularly broad in relation to insurance companies and the contracts they make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress has not taken over the regulation of marine insurance contracts and has not dealt with the effect of marine insurance warranties at all; hence there is no possible question here of conflict between state law and any federal statute. But this does not answer the questions presented, since in the absence of controlling Acts of Congress this Court has fashioned a large part of the existing rules that govern admiralty. And States can no more override such judicial rules validly fashioned than they can override Acts of Congress. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Garrett&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Moore-McCormack Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 317 U. S. 239. Consequently the crucial questions in this case narrow down to these: (1) Is there a judicially established federal admiralty rule governing these warranties? (2) If not, should we fashion one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only decision of this Court relied on by the Court of Appeals to support its holding that there is an established admiralty rule requiring strict fulfillment of marine insurance warranties was &lt;i&gt;Imperial Fire Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Coos County,&lt;/i&gt; 151 U. S. 452. There, because of a breach of warranty, an insurance company was relieved of liability for loss of a courthouse by fire, and this Court said it was immaterial whether the breach contributed to the loss. But no question of marine insurance was remotely involved nor was there any reliance on a marine insurance rule. Writing its own "general commercial law," as was the custom in diversity cases prior to &lt;i&gt;Erie R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tompkins,&lt;/i&gt; 304 U. S. 64, this Court in the &lt;i&gt;Coos County&lt;/i&gt; case simply followed a general doctrine commonly applied to warranties in all types of insurance.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; A mere &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*315&lt;/span&gt; cursory examination of the cases, state and federal, will disclose that through the years this common-law doctrine, when accepted, has been treated not as an admiralty rule but as a general warranty rule applicable to many types of contracts including marine and other insurance.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; There are very few federal cases on marine insurance in which the strict breach of warranty rule has even been considered. And only two circuits appear to have thought of the rule as a part of the general admiralty law.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; On the contrary, other circuit court decisions, including the ones relied on in those few cases holding the rule to be one of federal admiralty, seem to indicate that state law was followed in applying the rule&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt; or that the question was decided as one of "general commercial law," a uniform practice during the era of &lt;i&gt;Swift&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tyson,&lt;/i&gt; 16 Pet. 1.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt; This Court did say in one marine insurance case that warranties "must be strictly and literally performed." &lt;i&gt;Hazard's Administrator&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New England Marine Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/rxc/hazards-administrator-v-new-england-marine-ins-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Pet.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;557&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 580. But there is not the slightest indication that this statement referred to a federal admiralty rule and the Court in fact expressly followed and applied Massachusetts law to decide another question in that very case. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*316&lt;/span&gt; Whatever the origin of the "literal performance" rule may be,&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; we think it plain that it has not been judicially established as part of the body of federal admiralty law in this country. Therefore, the scope and validity of the policy provisions here involved and the consequences of breaching them can only be determined by state law&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt; unless we are now prepared to fashion controlling federal rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole judicial and legislative history of insurance regulation in the United States warns us against the judicial creation of admiralty rules to govern marine policy terms and warranties. The control of all types of insurance companies and contracts has been primarily a state function since the States came into being. In 1869, this Court held in &lt;i&gt;Paul&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Virginia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;168&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, that States possessed regulatory power over the insurance business and strongly indicated that the National Government did not have that power. Three years later, it was first authoritatively decided in &lt;i&gt;Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dunham, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; that federal courts could exercise "jurisdiction" over marine insurance contracts. In 1894, years after the &lt;i&gt;Dunham&lt;/i&gt; holding, this Court applied the doctrine of &lt;i&gt;Paul&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Virginia&lt;/i&gt; and held that States could regulate marine insurance the same as any other insurance. &lt;i&gt;Hooper&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;California,&lt;/i&gt; 155 U. S. 648. Later, the power of States to regulate marine insurance was reaffirmed in &lt;i&gt;Nutting&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Massachusetts,&lt;/i&gt; 183 U. S. 553. This constitutional doctrine carrying implications of exclusive state power to regulate all types of insurance contracts remained until 1944 when this Court decided &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;South-Eastern Underwriters Assn.,&lt;/i&gt; 322 U. S. 533. Thus it is clear that at least until 1944 this court has always &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*317&lt;/span&gt; treated marine insurance contracts, like all others, as subject to state control.&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt; The vast amount of insurance litigation in state courts throughout our history also bears witness that until recently state legislatures and state courts have treated marine insurance as controlled by state law to the same extent as all other insurance.&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt; This is aptly illustrated by a Massachusetts case decided in 1893 which expressly held a generally worded statute of that State relating to warranties to be applicable to marine insurance companies equally with other insurance companies. &lt;i&gt;Durkee&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;India Mutual Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;159&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Mass.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;514&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 34 N. E. 1133.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only courts, but Congress, insurance companies, and those insured have all acted on the assumption that States can regulate marine insurance. In the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, Congress recognized that marine insurance companies were operating under state laws.&lt;sup&gt;[18]&lt;/sup&gt; Then, following a three-year study of marine insurance, Congress in 1922 passed a law regulating &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; types of insurance in the District of Columbia.&lt;sup&gt;[19]&lt;/sup&gt; This enactment generally referred to as the District of Columbia Model Marine Insurance Act, had the backing of insurance companies generally and was hailed as a model which it was hoped States would copy. Because of a provision in the bill as offered relating to "policy forms and conditions," the bill was first criticized by a national association of shipowners but was later approved &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*318&lt;/span&gt; after the criticized provision was removed.&lt;sup&gt;[20]&lt;/sup&gt; Hearings on the bill make it plain that shipowners and marine insurance companies recognized that marine insurance was then, and would continue to be, regulated by the States. This model bill which it was hoped would serve as a pattern for States to follow was prompted in part by widespread doubt created by &lt;i&gt;Paul&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Virginia&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Hooper&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;California&lt;/i&gt; that the Federal Government could enter the field at all.&lt;sup&gt;[21]&lt;/sup&gt; Again in 1935 marine insurance was discussed in congressional hearings in connection with the Limitation of Liability Act. 49 Stat. 1479, 46 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 181-196. There representatives of shipowners strongly opposed regulation of marine insurance by federal authority, arguing that it was better for the States to retain their regulatory function.&lt;sup&gt;[22]&lt;/sup&gt; Finally, in 1944 and 1945, Congress had before it for consideration bills specifically designed to authorize States to continue to regulate the business of insurance. At the very beginning of extensive hearings on these bills the Committee's attention was directed to that part of this Court's opinion in &lt;i&gt;Hooper&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;California&lt;/i&gt; deciding that States could regulate the marine insurance business the same as they could regulate other kinds of insurance businesses.&lt;sup&gt;[23]&lt;/sup&gt; Again and again the Committee was reminded of the &lt;i&gt;Paul&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Hooper&lt;/i&gt; cases which together showed that States had previously been &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*319&lt;/span&gt; regulating marine insurance as well as all other types. Passage of the bill followed &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; holding that, despite the constitutional doctrine embodied in the &lt;i&gt;Paul&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Virginia&lt;/i&gt; line of cases, Congress had power under the Constitution to regulate interstate insurance transactions. In the &lt;i&gt;South-Eastern&lt;/i&gt; case, however, all the opinions had emphasized the historical fact that States had always been free to regulate insurance. The measure Congress passed shortly thereafter, known as the McCarran Act, was designed to assure that existing state power to regulate insurance would continue. Accordingly, the Act contains a broad declaration of congressional policy that the continued regulation of insurance by the States is in the public interest, and that silence on the part of Congress should not be construed to impose any barrier to continued regulation of insurance by the States.&lt;sup&gt;[24]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearings on the McCarran Act reveal the complexities and difficulties of an attempt to unify insurance law on a nationwide basis, even by Congress. Courts would find such a task far more difficult. Congress in passing laws is not limited to the narrow factual situation of a particular controversy as courts are in deciding lawsuits. And Congress could replace the presently functioning state regulations of marine insurance by one comprehensive Act. Courts, however, could only do it piecemeal, on a case-by-case basis. Such a creeping approach would result in leaving marine insurance largely unregulated for years to come.&lt;sup&gt;[25]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this very case, should we attempt to fashion an admiralty rule governing policy provisions, we would at &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*320&lt;/span&gt; once be faced with the difficulty of determining what should be the consequences of breaches. We could adopt the old common-law doctrine of forfeiting all right of recovery in the absence of strict and literal performance of warranties, but that is a harsh rule.&lt;sup&gt;[26]&lt;/sup&gt; Most States, deeming the old rule a breeder of wrong and injustice, have abandoned it in whole or in part. But that has left open the question of what kind of new rule could be substituted that would be fair both to insurance companies and policyholders. Out of their abundant broad experience in regulating the insurance business, some state legislatures have adopted one kind of new rule and some another.&lt;sup&gt;[27]&lt;/sup&gt; Some States for example have denied companies the right to forfeit policies in the absence of an insured's bad faith or fraud. Other States have thought this kind of rule inadequate to stamp out forfeiture practices deemed evil. The result, as this Court has pointed out, has been state statutes like that of Texas which "go to the root of the evil" and forbid forfeiture for an insured's breach of policy terms unless the breach actually contributes to bring about the loss insured against. &lt;i&gt;Northwestern National Life Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Riggs,&lt;/i&gt; 203 U. S. 243, 253-254. Thus there are a number of other possible rules from which this Court could fashion one for admiralty. But such a choice involves varied policy considerations and is obviously one which Congress is peculiarly suited to make. And we decline to undertake the task. See &lt;i&gt;Halcyon Lines&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Haenn Ship Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 342 U. S. 282, 285.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under our present system of diverse state regulations, which is as old as the Union, the insurance business has &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*321&lt;/span&gt; become one of the great enterprises of the Nation. Congress has been exceedingly cautious about disturbing this system, even as to marine insurance where congressional power is undoubted.&lt;sup&gt;[28]&lt;/sup&gt; We, like Congress, leave the regulation of marine insurance where it has been&#151;with the States.&lt;sup&gt;[29]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgments of the Court of Appeals and the District Court are reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for a trial under appropriate state law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring in the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case concerns a marine insurance policy covering a small houseboat yacht, inappropriately named &lt;i&gt;The Wanderer,&lt;/i&gt; plying the waters of Lake Texoma, an artificial inland lake between Texas and Oklahoma. The coverage of the policy was specifically restricted to &lt;i&gt;The Wanderer's&lt;/i&gt; trip to and use on that lake "solely for private pleasure purposes."&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; After &lt;i&gt;The Wanderer&lt;/i&gt; was destroyed by fire while lying idle on Lake Texoma, it was discovered that certain warranties of the insurance policy had been &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*322&lt;/span&gt; ignored by petitioner. Under a uniform rule of admiralty law governing breach of such warranties, petitioner probably would be unable to recover on the policy. Texas statute law, however, might excuse the breaches of warranty, although this is by no means clear. Our problem is whether this situation&#151;involving a marine policy such as is the basis of litigation&#151;calls for a uniform rule throughout the country applicable to breaches of warranty of all similar marine insurance contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that as to some matters affecting maritime affairs the States are excluded from indulging in variant state policies. &lt;i&gt;E. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chelentis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Luckenbach S. S. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 247 U. S. 372; &lt;i&gt;The Lottawanna,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;558&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Equally, there is no doubt that some matters are so predominantly restricted in the range of their significance that a uniform admiralty rule need not be recognized or fashioned. &lt;i&gt;E. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Madruga&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Superior Court,&lt;/i&gt; 346 U. S. 556; &lt;i&gt;C. J. Hendry Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Moore,&lt;/i&gt; 318 U. S. 133; &lt;i&gt;The Hamilton,&lt;/i&gt; 207 U. S. 398. Therefore the question, and the only question now to be decided, is whether the demands of uniformity relevant to maritime law require that marine insurance on a houseboat yacht brought to Lake Texoma for private recreation should be subject to the same rules of law as marine insurance on a houseboat yacht "confined," after arrival, to the waters of Lake Tahoe or Lake Champlain. The provision of the policy whereby the insured warranted "that the vessel be confined to Lake Texoma" conveys the emphasis of the situation&#151;the essentially localized incidence of the transaction despite the interstate route followed in reaching the circumscribed radius within which the yacht was to move. It is reasonable to conclude that the interests concerned with shipping in its national and international aspects are substantially unconcerned with the rules of law to be applied to such limited situations. I join in a result restricted within this compass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*323&lt;/span&gt; Unfortunately, for reasons that I do not appreciate, the Court's opinion goes beyond the needs of the problem before it. Unless I wholly misconceive that opinion, its language would be invoked when cases so decisively different in degree as to be different in kind come before this Court. It seems directed with equal force to ocean-going vessels in international maritime trade, as well as coastal, intercoastal and river commerce. Is it to be assumed that were the &lt;i&gt;Queen Mary,&lt;/i&gt; on a world pleasure cruise, to touch at New York City, New Orleans and Galveston, a Lloyd's policy covering the voyage would be subjected to the varying insurance laws of New York, Louisiana and Texas? Such an assumption, I am confident, would not prevail were decision necessary. The business of marine insurance often may be so related to the success of many manifestations of commercial maritime endeavor as to demand application of a uniform rule of law designed to eliminate the vagaries of state law and to keep harmony with the marine insurance laws of other great maritime powers. See &lt;i&gt;Queen Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Globe Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 263 U. S. 487, 493; &lt;i&gt;Calmar Steamship Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Scott,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 427, 442-443. It cannot be that by this decision the Court means suddenly to jettison the whole past of the admiralty provision of Article III and to renounce requirements for nationwide maritime uniformity, except insofar as Congress has specifically enacted them, in the field of marine insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is appropriate to recall that the preponderant body of maritime law comes from this Court and not from Congress. Judicial enforcement of nationwide rules regarding marine insurance is, as my brother REED cogently shows, deeply rooted in history. What reason is there for abruptly turning over, pending action by Congress, to the crazy-quilt regulation of the different States what so long has been the business of the courts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is true of other maritime interests, however, the demand for uniformity is not inflexible and does not preclude &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*324&lt;/span&gt; the balancing of the competing claims of state, national and international interests. The process and some of the relevant considerations here are not unlike those involved when the question is whether a State, in the absence of congressional action, may regulate some matters even though aspects of interstate commerce are affected. In rejecting abdication of all responsibility by this Court for uniformities in marine insurance and its complete surrender to the States, one is not required to embrace another absolute, complete absorption by this Court of the field of marine insurance and entire exclusion of the States. It is not necessary to assert that uniformity, if it be required in any case, is required in all cases cognizable in admiralty&#151;whether the craft was for business or pleasure, touched in five states, five nations or never left the confines of an inland lake. The deceptive lure of certainty and comprehensive symmetry should not be permitted to conceal the fact that admiralty's expansion beyond "the ebb and flow of the tides" has been a response to demands more inclusive than those for mechanical uniformity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the distribution of power between national authority and local law, admiralty has developed for more than a hundred years by rulings of the Court, but not by absolutes either of abstention or extension. While not able to join the dissenters, I can only hope that what are essentially &lt;i&gt;dicta&lt;/i&gt; will not be found controlling when situations which have not called them forth, and to which they are not applicable, come before the Court for adjudication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE REED, with whom MR. JUSTICE BURTON joins, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opinion of the Court states that "the crucial questions in this case narrow down to these: (1) Is there a judicially established federal admiralty rule governing these warranties? (2) If not, should we fashion one?" &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*325&lt;/span&gt; By question (1) the Court means, as its opinion shows, a federal admiralty rule that a warranty of an insured is to be strictly enforced with the result that a breach of the warranty relieves the insurer of liability for loss although the breach was not shown to have contributed to the loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court concludes that the literal performance rule has not been established by statute or by judicial decision. It acknowledges that a maritime insurance policy is a maritime contract brought under federal jurisdiction by the Admiralty Clause of the Constitution. &lt;i&gt;Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dunham,&lt;/i&gt; 11 Wall. 1. And so it recognizes that the power "to fashion controlling federal rules" rests in the Federal Government&#151;in Congress and the federal courts. However, the Court determines that in the absence of congressional action it will leave the formulation of rules governing marine insurance policies to the States. It applies this conclusion to the effect of a breach of warranty in a maritime insurance policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagree with both conclusions. Our admiralty laws, like our common law, came from England. As a matter of American judicial policy, we tend to keep our marine insurance laws in harmony with those of England. &lt;i&gt;Queen Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Globe Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 263 U. S. 487, 493; &lt;i&gt;Calmar Steamship Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Scott,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 427, 442-443. Before our Revolution, the rule of strict compliance with maritime insurance warranties had been established as the law of England.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; That rule persists. While no case of this Court has been cited or found that says specifically that the rule of strict compliance is to be applied in admiralty and maritime cases, that presupposition has been consistently adopted as the basis of reasoning from our &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*326&lt;/span&gt; earliest days.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Other courts have been more specific.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; No case holds to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am inclined to think that Congress or this Court might well consider modifying the strict rule insofar as the breached warranty does not contribute to the loss. But since the Court concludes that it will not undertake the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*327&lt;/span&gt; task,&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; it is unnecessary for me to go farther than to say that in the absence of federal amelioration I would follow the established rule of holding the insured to his warranty.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me to the crucial phase of the Court's decision which, so the Court says, "leave[s] the regulation of marine insurance where it has been&#151;with the States." This is the dominant issue here, and the Court's decision strikes deep into the principle of a uniform admiralty law and will have the result of unduly burdening maritime commerce. This is the issue presented by the petition for certiorari and argued in petitioners' brief on the merits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One rule of law stands unquestioned. That is that all courts, state and federal, which have jurisdiction to enforce maritime or admiralty substantive rights must do so according to federal admiralty law.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; See particularly the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*328&lt;/span&gt; excellent discussion by Judge Magruder in &lt;i&gt;Doucette&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Vincent,&lt;/i&gt; 194 F. 2d 834, 841 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; The issue of an insurer's liability upon an insured's broken warranty is clearly a matter of substantive law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court relies upon &lt;i&gt;Paul&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Virginia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;168&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;i&gt;Hooper&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;California,&lt;/i&gt; 155 U. S. 648; and &lt;i&gt;Nutting&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Massachusetts,&lt;/i&gt; 183 U. S. 553, as holding that "States could regulate marine insurance the same as any other insurance." Those cases only approve provisions of state law that require agents and companies to take out licenses and conform to various conditions preliminary to doing business.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; The Court also relies on congressional action and inaction, but the fact that Congress has regulated the organization, taxing and licensing of fire, casualty and marine insurance companies in the District of Columbia, and has recognized the existence of marine companies under the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, has no relevancy to whether the provisions of state law should control the effect to be given to warranties in marine insurance policies. Nor does the McCarran Act indicate that States may legislate to change fundamentally maritime insurance law.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; It was so decided in &lt;i&gt;Maryland Casualty Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cushing,&lt;/i&gt; 347 U. S. 409, 413. The answer as to whether state or federal law governs marine insurance contracts lies in the nature of the federal admiralty jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Constitution, Art. III, &#167; 2, provides that "The judicial Power shall extend . . . to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction . . . ." The First Congress enacted that the district courts "shall also have exclusive original cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction . . . saving to suitors, in all cases, the right of a common law remedy, where the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*329&lt;/span&gt; common law is competent to give it . . . ."&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; In this manner national control was asserted over maritime litigation. It was needed because the Republic bordered a great length of the Atlantic littoral and the navigable waters furnished the best avenue of transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although congressional authority over maritime trade was not expressly granted by the Constitution, the grant of admiralty jurisdiction together with the Necessary and Proper Clause has been found adequate to enable Congress to declare the prevailing maritime law for navigable waters throughout the Nation.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; The Commerce Clause aids where interstate commerce is affected, but has not the scope of "navigable waters."&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; Congressional &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*330&lt;/span&gt; power to rest exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts where, as here, the constitutionally delegated judicial authority exists, is established. &lt;i&gt;The Moses Taylor,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;411&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 429. The remedy preserved by the savings clause of the Judiciary Act of 1789, "is not a remedy in the common-laws courts . . . but a common-law remedy." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 431. The meaning of the quoted clause becomes plainer when read with the state statute which &lt;i&gt;The Moses Taylor&lt;/i&gt; held unconstitutional. That statute authorized a "proceeding against the vessel," a strictly &lt;i&gt;in rem&lt;/i&gt; proceeding in admiralty, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 412, 413, different from the common-law action &lt;i&gt;in personam.&lt;/i&gt; Consequently, when a California resident brought an &lt;i&gt;in rem&lt;/i&gt; proceeding in a California court, he was pursuing an admiralty remedy, not a common-law remedy. This Court, therefore, held the case outside the savings clause of the ninth section of the Judiciary Act of 1789.&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a state court was held to have jurisdiction to sell a vessel to enforce a lien in &lt;i&gt;Knapp, Stout &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McCaffrey,&lt;/i&gt; 177 U. S. 638, where the suit was against the owner, &lt;i&gt;in personam,&lt;/i&gt; although in equity for foreclosure of a possessory lien. "[T]he remedy chosen by the plaintiff was the detention of the raft for his towage charges." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 644. As this was a state approved remedy in the common law, the use of state equity procedure to enforce the lien was held to be in accord with the reservation of a common-law remedy from the exclusive jurisdiction of admiralty.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt; Thus, by &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*331&lt;/span&gt; saving a suitor's common-law remedy, Congress has created by &#167; 9 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, now 28 U. S. C. (Supp. V, 1952) &#167; 1333, only a limited exclusive jurisdiction. The state courts may furnish not only a common-law remedy existing at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, for substantive admiralty rights, but also new judicial remedies created by statute; that is, whatever remedy is not strictly &lt;i&gt;in rem.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*332&lt;/span&gt; State authority, however, although it may provide remedies, does not extend to changing the general substantive admiralty law. That is the maritime law existing as a body of law enforceable in admiralty. The extent of the States' power to grant rights arising from maritime incidents is not subject to definition. It may vary as the course or manner of navigation or commerce changes. It exists in some circumstances, see &lt;i&gt;Just&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chambers,&lt;/i&gt; 312 U. S. 383, 388, and, as indicated both in the majority and minority opinions in the &lt;i&gt;Jensen&lt;/i&gt; case, 244 U. S. 205, must be determined in each situation.&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt; The principles which control the validity of an assertion of state power in the admiralty sphere are, however, clear. State power may be exercised where it is complementary to the general admiralty law. It may not be exercised where it would have the effect of harming any necessary or desirable uniformity.&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt; The cases decided by this Court make it plain that state legislation will not be permitted to burden maritime commerce with variable rules of law that destroy that uniformity.&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*333&lt;/span&gt; Since Congress has power to make federal jurisdiction and legislation exclusive, the situation in admiralty is somewhat analogous to that governing state action interfering with interstate commerce. In the absence of congressional direction, it is this Court that must bear the heavy responsibility of saying when a state statute has burdened the required federal uniformity.&lt;sup&gt;[18]&lt;/sup&gt; It is one thing to allow the States to add a remedy or create a new cause of action for certain incidents arising out of maritime activity. It is quite another thing to relinquish an entire body of substantive law making for a whole phase of maritime activity to the States. Such action does violence to the premise upon which the admiralty jurisdiction was constructed.&lt;sup&gt;[19]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not only in markings, lights, signals, and navigation that States are barred from legislation interfering with maritime operation. The need for a uniform rule is just as great when dealing with the effect to be given to marine insurance on boats which plough our navigable waters. A vessel moves from State to State along our coasts or rivers. State lines may run with the channel or across it. Under maritime custom an insurance policy usually covers the vessel wherever it may go. If uniformity is needed anywhere, it is needed in marine insurance. It is like the question of seaworthiness which must be controlled by one law. It presents the same problem as a state law controlling the operation of interstate boats. &lt;i&gt;Kelly&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Washington,&lt;/i&gt; 302 U. S. 1, 15. For a State to require policies to be issued under its authority or to require extra-state policies to be interpreted by its laws &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*334&lt;/span&gt; burdens maritime operations unduly. Shipmasters must know how to handle their vessels to preserve their insurance. Insurers must know the risks they are assuming when they fix their premiums. What law is to govern&#151; that of the State where the insurance contract was issued, the State of the accident, or the State of the forum? It seems an unreasonable interference with maritime activity to allow the many States to declare the substantive law of marine insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court refuses to declare the governing maritime law on warranties in this case because it could only be done "piecemeal, on a case-by-case basis." It would prefer to await congressional enactment of a comprehensive code. But questions of contract interpretation and the effect to be given to contract provisions are questions which the Court is particularly equipped to handle. A broad legislative approach might be desirable; but in its absence we could establish a rule governing the effect to be given to breaches of warranties which would be binding on every court in the land. It is certainly not desirable to defer to the legislature of Texas or any other State which, though it can enact a comprehensive code, can make it binding only in its own State. To do so destroys the essential uniformity of the maritime law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My understanding of the facts and legal issues and the rule to be deduced from the Court's decision forbids my joining the limited concurrence of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER. The policy here is not restricted to the boat's use on Lake Texoma nor to its use in any one State. In addition to its use on the lake, the policy covered a "cruise from Greenville, Mississippi via Mississippi and Red Rivers to Denison, Texas" and then to the lake. The waters of five States were navigated before reaching the lake, which is itself an interstate body of water laying between Texas and Oklahoma. The considerations which lead me to favor a uniform rule are not changed simply &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*335&lt;/span&gt; because a relatively small boat was here involved, or the number of States through which it passed were few, or because its ultimate destination was a small lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This state rule of law covering the incidents of marine insurance affects not only Texas or Lake Texoma but the longest voyage within the cruising capacity of &lt;i&gt;The Wanderer.&lt;/i&gt; As is shown by &lt;i&gt;The Hamilton,&lt;/i&gt; 207 U. S. 398, such an exercise of state power permits the States to declare the applicable laws of marine insurance even on the high seas. The event of loss must always be local, but the coverage of the policy is general.&lt;sup&gt;[20]&lt;/sup&gt; When state power intrudes upon the uniformity imposed by federal law, its exercise is invalid when applied to maritime litigation whether the application occurs in litigation arising from an incident that happens on a small lake or a mighty river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would affirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  "It Is Also Agreed that this insurance shall be void in case this Policy or the interest insured thereby shall be sold, assigned, transferred or pledged without the previous consent in writing of the Assurers."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Warranted by the Assured that the within named vessel shall be used solely for private pleasure purposes during the currency of this Policy and shall not be hired or chartered unless permission is granted by endorsement hereon."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Vernon's Rev. Civ. Stat., 1936, Art. 4890: "Any provision in any policy of insurance issued by any company subject to the provisions of this law to the effect that if said property is encumbered by a lien of any character or shall after the issuance of such policy become encumbered by a lien of any character then such encumbrance shall render such policy void shall be of no force and effect. Any such provision within or placed upon any such policy shall be null and void."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Vernon's Rev. Civ. Stat., 1936, Art. 4930: "No breach or violation by the insured of any warranty, condition or provision of any fire insurance policy, contract of insurance, or application therefor, upon personal property, shall render void the policy or contract, or constitute a defense to a suit for loss thereon, unless such breach or violation contributed to bring about the destruction of the property."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  The District Court said: "After much consideration of the above matter, I am of the opinion that the policy involved here is a maritime contract and therefore governed by the general admiralty law and not by the law of Texas, since the policy covered the vessel on navigable waters of the United States, without as well as within the State of Texas, and I find that the waters of Lake Texoma are navigable waters of the United States."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  There was evidence that prior to the loss the company had notice that the boat was constantly used for commercial purposes. Because of this petitioners urged that the company had waived the policy provision against such use and was also estopped to plead it. Questions involved in these contentions remain wholly open for consideration by the District Court in any new trial that may be had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  The Court of Appeals assumed that if any state law applied it was that of Texas. The question of the appropriate state law is not before us, however, and we express no opinion on that aspect of the case. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Watson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Employers Liability Assur. Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 348 U. S. 66. Likewise we are not concerned at this time with whether the District Court's holdings that the Wilburn's transactions constituted breaches, and that the breaches had not been waived by the company, would be correct holdings under state law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[28]  Congress has made certain provisions in connection with war risk insurance. 64 Stat. 773, 46 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 1281-1294. And to a very limited extent it has authorized governmental agencies to regulate policies and insurance companies which are insuring vessels in which the Government has some interest. 41 Stat. 992, 46 U. S. C. &#167; 868; 52 Stat. 969, 46 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 1271-1279; 55 Stat. 243, 50 U. S. C. App. &#167; 1273.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[29]  It is faintly contended that the Federal Constitution forbids States to regulate marine insurance, even where Congress acquiesces or expressly consents. This contention is so lacking in merit that it need not be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]  The yacht had been purchased by the Wilburns while at Greenville, Mississippi. The policy had covered port risks at the Greenville yacht basin, the river voyage to Denison, Texas, and the overland "skid" around the dam onto the lake. The policy contemplated that &lt;i&gt;The Wanderer&lt;/i&gt; would be "locked through to Texoma Lake," but there are no locks permitting water passage onto the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The interest insured is admitted to be American property, in the strictest sense of the term; but it is contended, that Baruro, a Spanish subject, had an interest in the cargo, which falsifies the warranty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Whether Baruro could be considered as having an interest in the cargo, or not, is a question of some intricacy, which the court has not decided; and which, if determined in the one way or the other, would not affect the warranty; because, the assured are not understood to warrant that the whole cargo is neutral, but that the interest insured is neutral."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[9]  Judiciary Act of 1789, &#167; 9, 1 Stat. 77. There has been no intentional change in meaning by the revision of 1948, 28 U. S. C. (Supp. V, 1952) &#167; 1333, which reads:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(1) Any civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reviser's Note states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The `saving to suitors' clause in sections 41 (3) and 371 (3) of title 28, U. S. C., 1940 ed., was changed by substituting the words `any other remedy to which he is otherwise entitled' for the words `the right of a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it.'

Cf. &lt;i&gt;O'Donnell&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Great Lakes Dredge Co.,&lt;/i&gt; n. 10, &lt;i&gt;supra.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[12]  The same rule was applied in efforts to enforce state-created liens in state courts by proceedings &lt;i&gt;in rem&lt;/i&gt; against the boat in &lt;i&gt;The Robert W. Parsons,&lt;/i&gt; 191 U. S. 17, 37, and in &lt;i&gt;The Glide,&lt;/i&gt; 167 U. S. 606, 616-618, 623-624.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[13]  Mr. Justice Brown wrote for the Court:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The true distinction between such proceedings as are and such as are not invasions of the exclusive admiralty jurisdiction is this: If the cause of action be one cognizable in admiralty, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the suit be &lt;i&gt;in rem&lt;/i&gt; against the thing itself, though a monition be also issued to the owner, the proceeding is essentially one in admiralty. If, upon the other hand, the cause of action be not one of which a court of admiralty has jurisdiction, &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; if the suit be &lt;i&gt;in personam&lt;/i&gt; against an individual defendant, with an auxiliary attachment against a particular thing, or against the property of the defendant in general, it is essentially a proceeding according to the course of the common law, and within the saving clause of the statute . . . of a common law remedy. The suit in this case being one in equity to enforce a common law remedy, the state courts were correct in assuming jurisdiction." 177 U. S., at 648.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The `right of a common law remedy', so saved to suitors, does not, as has been held in cases which presently will be mentioned, include attempted changes by the States in the substantive admiralty law [&lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; at p. 124, where it was said of state statutes held unconstitutional, they were "invalid, because their provisions were held to modify or displace essential features of the substantive maritime law"], but it does include all means other than proceedings in admiralty which may be employed to enforce the right or to redress the injury involved. It includes remedies &lt;i&gt;in pais,&lt;/i&gt; as well as proceedings in court; judicial remedies conferred by statute, as well as those existing at the common law; remedies in equity, as well as those enforceable in a court of law. &lt;i&gt;Knapp, Stout &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McCaffrey,&lt;/i&gt; 177 U.

A State may not provide a remedy &lt;i&gt;in rem&lt;/i&gt; for any cause of action within the admiralty jurisdiction. &lt;i&gt;The Hine&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Trevor,&lt;/i&gt; 4 Wall. 555; &lt;i&gt;The Glide,&lt;/i&gt; 167 U. S. 606. But otherwise, the State, having concurrent jurisdiction, is free to adopt such remedies, and to attach to them such incidents, as it sees fit. New York, therefore, had the power to confer upon its courts the authority to compel parties within its jurisdiction to specifically perform an agreement for arbitration, which is valid by the general maritime law, as well as by the law of the State, which is contained in a contract made in New York and which, by its terms, is to be performed there."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Argued March 29, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided April 11, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Harry A. Smith&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Charles P. Bauer.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Charles H. Walker&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Charles E. Nichols&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Henry J. Zafian.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PER CURIAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment is reversed. The petitioner's notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals from a judgment of the District Court for the Northern District of New York, together with his appeal bond, was received at the office of the Clerk of the District Court within the 30 days prescribed by 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2107 for filing a notice of appeal. In dispatching these papers the petitioner inadvertently failed to include the $5 fee required by 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1917 to be paid "upon the filing" of a notice of appeal. The Clerk notified the petitioner of his omission, and declined to "file" the notice of appeal until he received the $5 fee three or four days later. By that time the 30-day period for appeal had expired. Upon petitioner's motion the District Court made a &lt;i&gt;nunc pro tunc&lt;/i&gt; order according the notice of appeal a filing date as of the date it was originally received by the Clerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*47&lt;/span&gt; The Court of Appeals, without opinion, dismissed the appeal as untimely. We think that the Clerk's receipt of the notice of appeal within the 30-day period satisfied the requirements of &#167; 2107, and that untimely payment of the &#167; 1917 fee did not vitiate the validity of petitioner's notice of appeal. Anything to the contrary in such cases as &lt;i&gt;Mondakota Gas Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Montana-Dakota Utilities Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 194 F. 2d 705 (C. A. 9th Cir. 1952), we disapprove. Our conclusion does not leave &#167; 1917 without other sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF OKLAHOMA.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Douglas F. Smith&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for appellant in Nos. 191 and 321. &lt;i&gt;Clarence H. Ross&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for appellant in No. 321. With them on the brief were &lt;i&gt;D. H. Culton, Coleman Hayes, Warren T. Spies&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Arthur R. Seder, Jr.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mac Q. Williamson,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General of Oklahoma, and &lt;i&gt;T. Murray Robinson&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for appellees in No. 191. &lt;i&gt;Hugh B. Cox&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for appellees in No. 321. With them on a joint brief were &lt;i&gt;Rayburn L. Foster, Harry D. Turner, R. M. Williams&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kenneth Heady. Mr. Robinson&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Leon Shipp&lt;/i&gt; also filed a brief for appellees in No. 191.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PER CURIAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these cases Oklahoma has attempted to fix a minimum price to be paid for natural gas, after its production and gathering has ended, by a company which transports the gas for resale in interstate commerce. We held in &lt;i&gt;Phillips Petroleum Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin,&lt;/i&gt; 347 U. S. 672, that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*45&lt;/span&gt; such a sale and transportation cannot be regulated by a State but are subject to the exclusive regulation of the Federal Power Commission. The &lt;i&gt;Phillips&lt;/i&gt; case, therefore, controls this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We disagree with the contention of the appellees that &lt;i&gt;Cities Service Gas Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Peerless Oil and Gas Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 340 U. S. 179, and &lt;i&gt;Phillips Petroleum Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Oklahoma,&lt;/i&gt; 340 U. S. 190, are applicable here. In those cases we were dealing with constitutional questions and not the construction of the Natural Gas Act. The latter question was specifically not passed upon in those cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, being of opinion that State regulation of price is permissible until the Federal price regulation permitted by &lt;i&gt;Phillips Petroleum Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin,&lt;/i&gt; 347 U. S. 672, is imposed, dissents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;William H. Timbers&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Myron S. Isaacs&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Elizabeth B. A. Rogers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Arthur H. Dean&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Henry S. Drinker, Thomas Reath&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;John Mulford.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*342&lt;/span&gt; MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question in the case is whether the Securities and Exchange Commission has jurisdiction to pass on a fee to be paid by Electric Bond &amp;amp; Share Co. to Drexel &amp;amp; Co. in connection with a reorganization plan filed by its subsidiary, Electric Power &amp;amp; Light Corp., under &#167; 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 803, 15 U. S. C. &#167; 79a &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; We hold that the Commission does have jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem arises out of the unraveling and reorganization of the vast empire of Bond &amp;amp; Share, pursuant to the command of the Act. The present case is one of several phases of the various reorganization plans adopted to bring the system into compliance.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The instant phase of this system's reorganization grew out of the filing of a voluntary plan of reorganization under &#167; 11 (e) by Electric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric owned operating subsidiaries in several States and in Mexico. The plan provided that (1) Electric would transfer to a new holding company, Middle South Utilities, Inc., its holdings in those operating subsidiaries, as well as certain other assets; (2) preferred stocks of Electric would be retired by distributing to those security holders shares of Middle. South and shares of another subsidiary of Electric; (3) the remaining shares of Middle South and the other subsidiary would be distributed to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*343&lt;/span&gt; the holders of the common stock and of the warrants of Electric; and (4) Bond &amp;amp; Share would pay Electric &amp;amp;2,200,000 in settlement of intrasystem claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan field by Electric under &#167; 11 (e) required Bond &amp;amp; Share to do three things: &lt;i&gt;first,&lt;/i&gt; sell or exchange its holdings of Electric stock; &lt;i&gt;second,&lt;/i&gt; acquire in exchange the shares of Middle South and the other subsidiary; and &lt;i&gt;third,&lt;/i&gt; pay the cash amount in settlement of the intrasystem claims. It was not sufficient for Bond &amp;amp; Share that Electric get approval for its plan under &#167; 11 (e). It was also necessary by the terms of the Act that Bond &amp;amp; Share also get the Commission's approval of the steps required of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond &amp;amp; Share's exchange of its securities for the new securities was a "sale" under the Act, for "sale" includes "exchange." &#167; 2 (a) (23). Bond &amp;amp; Share is a registered holding company. No "sale" of securities can be made by a registered holding company without Commission approval. That is the command of &#167; 12 of the Act.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; That approval is obtained, as &#167; 12 shows,&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; by a procedure which submits the fees in connection with the sale to the scrutiny and approval of the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond &amp;amp; Share's receipt of the new securities was an "acquisition" within the meaning of the Act. &#167; 2 (a) &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*344&lt;/span&gt; (22). That "acquisition" was made subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission by &#167; 9 (a).&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; That approval could be had only by submitting the "acquisition" to the Commission's scrutiny pursuant to &#167; 10 of the Act, a scrutiny that includes supervision of the fees paid by the holding company in connection with the "acquisition."&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond &amp;amp; Share's cash payment in settlement of the intra system claim was incident to the "sale" under &#167; 12 and the "acquisition" under &#167; 10. And, as noted, all three transactions by Bond &amp;amp; Share were parts of the plan filed by Electric under &#167; 11 (e).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond &amp;amp; Share, therefore, files an application pursuant to &#167;&#167; 10, 11, and 12 of the Act, asking for the Commission's approval of the transactions which the plan required of it.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*345&lt;/span&gt; The Commission consolidated the proceedings involving Electric's plan and Bond &amp;amp; Share's application and heard them together, and on March 7, 1949, entered one order in the consolidated proceedings, approving both. As respects Bond &amp;amp; Share the order said, "IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the application-declaration of Bond and Share referred to above be and it is hereby granted and permitted to become effective." As respects the plan of Electric, the Commission in the same order gave its approval, subject to additional terms and conditions, the second of which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"That jurisdiction be and hereby is specifically reserved to determine the reasonableness and appropriate allocation of all fees expenses and other &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*346&lt;/span&gt; remuneration incurred or to be incurred in connection with the said plan, as amended, and the transactions incident thereto, other than the fairness and reasonableness of the fees and expenses incident to the stockholders' actions enumerated in Part II of the Plan, as amended."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is said, however, that that reservation was "the reservation regarding . . . the fees in connection with Electric's plan under &#167; 11, and cannot be made to supply the failure to fix or to reserve the matter of fees in the proceedings under &#167;&#167; 10 and 12 in relation to which they were incurred."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two answers to that argument. &lt;i&gt;First,&lt;/i&gt; the reservation was made in the &#167; 10 and &#167; 12 proceedings, for they were consolidated with the &#167; 11 proceedings and one order entered in all three. &lt;i&gt;Second,&lt;/i&gt; the order in the consolidated proceedings reserved jurisdiction over the fees and expenses incurred not only "in connection with the said plan" but also in connection with "the transactions incident thereto." The latter obviously included the matters under &#167; 10 and &#167; 12, for they were the chief collateral ones before the Commission at the time. The parties so understood it, for Bond &amp;amp; Share and Drexel filed petitions for approval of the Drexel fee, invoking the reserved jurisdiction of the Commission. The Commission held hearings and fixed a fee for Drexel.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*347&lt;/span&gt; which neither Drexel nor Bond &amp;amp; Share though adequate.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; The Commission applied to the District Court for approval of this and other fee and expense orders. The District Court approved. The Court of Appeals affirmed, except for the order as to Drexel; and as to that it reversed "for lack of jurisdiction in the Commission." 210 F. 2d 585, 592.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see no such infirmity in the Commission's order. The Commission plainly has power under &#167; and under &#167; 12 to fix the fees payable by Bond &amp;amp; Share. To be sure, the Commission did not fix any fee, when on March 7, 1949, it entered the consolidated order approving the applications under &#167;&#167; 10, 11 and 12. That order merely reserved jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of the fees. There is a suggestion that no reservation of jurisdiction over the fees is possible, at least so far as &#167; 10 is concerned, since &#167; 10 directs the Commission to approve the plan unless it finds the fees unreasonable. But the reservation by the Commission of jurisdiction over the fees is merely a means of assuring that they will not be unreasonable. Certainly, the Commission need not hold an entire plan in abeyance until it completes hearings on the fees to be paid in connection with one phase of it. We see no reason why the Commission, in the interest of orderly administration, cannot defer consideration of all the fees, until it has time to view the entire matter in perspective and evaluate the worth of each contribution. We would have to read the Act with an extremely hostile eye to deny the Commission that administrative leeway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error of the Court of Appeals was in overlooking the essential and critical role that &#167;&#167; 10 and 12 play in the case and in relying on &#167; 11 (e) alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contrast between &#167;&#167; 11 (e) and 11 (f) is plain, so far as jurisdiction over fees is concerned. Section 11 (f) &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*348&lt;/span&gt; contains an express provision concerning fees. The subsection, applicable to court proceedings where a receiver or trustee has been appointed, makes all fees "to whomsoever paid" subject to the approval of the Commission. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Leiman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Guttman,&lt;/i&gt; 336 U. S. I. Section 11 (e) contains no such provision. It merely directs the Commission to approve the plan, if it finds the plan "fair and equitable to the persons affected." The amount of fees to be paid by Electric plainly would be relevant to the question whether the plan, if it finds the "fair and &lt;i&gt;In re Public Service Corp. of New Jersey,&lt;/i&gt; 211 F. 2d 231, 232. Payment of excessive fees was one of the historic abuses of the reorganization procedure whereby utility companies were milked, an abuse the Public Utility holdings Company Acts sought to correct. 79 Cong. Rec. 4607; S. Rep. No. 612, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 33. Questions of fees payable by and to protective committees present social considerations irrelevant here and we out them aside. &lt;i&gt;Leiman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Guttman, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; Different considerations come into play when fees payable by individual security holders to their own counsel are involved. It would seems, for example, that the amount which a stockholders, say, agreed to pay his lawyer for representing him in a &#167; 11 (e) proceeding would be no business of the Commission. The amount of that fee would seems to have no direct bearing on the fairness of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the fees payable by the registered holdings company in connections with the reorganization of its subsidiary or affiliate are, or may be, different. At least Congress thoughts so, for Congress was explicit in making the fees payable by them, in connection with the transactions covered by &#167; 10 and by &#167; 12, subjects to Commission approval. Congress had before it the detailed record of holdings company activities and knew that many of them had a proclivity for predatory practices. The fees were not only large; they were often loaded on affiliated &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*349&lt;/span&gt; companies&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; concealed in intrasystem accounts. Congress decided to put an end to the worst of these practices and control the critical ones. When it came to the intricacies of holding company finance, Congress expended the desire to have the amount of the fees paid brought to light and to have the Commission decide who pays them and what amounts are reasonable. We cannot be faithful to that statutory design without granting the Commission the jurisdiction asserted here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE BURTON joins, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fully aware of the complicated interrelations of holding-company systems, Congress did not enact a scheme for severance of all intercorporate relations among public utility interests. Instead, specific provisions were devised against specific abuses and the Securities and Exchange Commission was given specific authority to effectuate the defined functions of these different provisions. Enforcement of the Act entailed authorization by the Commission of reorganization to secure simplification of a holding-company system and regulation of transactions involving acquisitions and dispositions. Duly mindful of the abuses of excessive fees in the conduct of inter-company affairs, Congress effectively equipped the Commission with power to regulate fees in the various proceedings which required approval by the Commission. But Congress particularized. It did not vest this fee-fixing authority of the Commission in a comprehensive provision. It dealt with the problem distributively. It was &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*350&lt;/span&gt; explicit in relating the power to fix fees to the particular proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter before us relates to the fixing of fees in a proceeding under &#167; 11 of the Holding Company Act. That was a proceeding for the reorganization of Electric, a subsidiary of Bond and Share. That section gave the Commission full power to fix fees to be paid by Electric as a condition to approval of its plan for reorganization. To be sure, Electric's plan involved the parent, Bond and Share, and the confirmation of Electric's plan required approval by the Commission of "acquisition" by Bond and Share of new securities. That approval under &#167; 10 subjected the fees which Bond and Share could pay Drexel to the scrutiny and approval of the Commission. The consummation of Electric's plan likewise involved a "sale" by Bond and Share under &#167; 12. Again, that section made Bond and Share's payment of fees to Drexel subject to the Commission's approval. The Commission gave the required approval to the "acquisition" and "sale" under &#167;&#167; 10 and 12, respectively, without passing on the fee payable by Bond and Share or reserving the question of the propriety of such fees. The reservation regarding fees in the proceedings of Electric was applicable to the fees in connection with Electric's plan under &#167; 11, and cannot be made to supply the failure to fix or to reserve the matter of fees in the proceedings under &#167;&#167; 10 and 12 in relation to which they were incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holding Company Act of 1935 is a reticulated statute, not a hodge-podge. To observe its explicit provisions is to respect the purpose of Congress and the care with which it was formulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would affirm the Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2]  Section 12 provides:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It shall be unlawful for any registered holdings company, by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or otherwise, to sell any security which it owns of any public-utility company, or any utility assets, in contravention of such rules and regulations of orders regarding the considerations to be received for such sale, maintenance of competitive conditions, fees and commissions, accounts, disclosure of interest, and similar matters as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers or to prevent the circumvention of the provisions of this title or the rules, regulations, or orders there under."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; note 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Section 9 (a) provides in relevant part:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unless the acquisition has been approved by the Commission under section 10, it shall be unlawful&#151;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(1) for any registered holdings company or any subsidiary company thereof, by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or otherwise, to acquire, directly or indirectly, any securities or utility assets or any other interest in any business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  Section 10 (b) provides in relevant part:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If the requirements of subsection (f) are satisfied, the commission shall approve the acquisition unless the Commission finds that&#151;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(2) in case of the acquisition of securities or utility assets, the consideration, including all fees, commissions, and other remuneration, to whomsoever paid, to be given, directly or indirectly, in connection with such acquisition is not reasonable or does not bear a fair relation to the sums invested in or the earning capacity of the utility assets to be acquired or the utility assets underlying the securities to be acquired; . . . ."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  A petition for rehearing states that Electric is not a "public utility company" within the meaning of the Act and therefore &#167; 12 (d) is inapplicable. We do not prejudice that position by this opinion, for whether or not Electric is "public utility company," &#167; 12 of the Act is concededly applicable. Section 12 (C) provides:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It shall be unlawful for any registered holdings company or any subsidiary company thereof, by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or otherwise, to declare or pay any dividend on any security of such company or to acquire, retire, or redeem any security of such company, in contravention of such rules and regulations or orders as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate to protect the financial integrity of companies in holding-company systems, to safeguard the working capital of public-utility companies, to prevent the payments of dividends out of capital or unearned surplus, or to prevent the circumvention of the provision of this title or the rules, regulations, or orders thereunder."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 12 (f) provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It shall be unlawful for any registered holdings company or subsidiary company thereof, by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or otherwise, to negotiate, enter into, or take any step in the performance of any transaction not otherwise unlawful under this title, with any company in the same holding-company system or with any affiliate of a company in such holding-company system in contravention of such rules and regulations or orders regarding reports,accounts, costs, maintenance of competitive conditions, disclosure of interest, duration of contracts, and similar matters as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers or to prevent the circumvention of the provision of this title or the rules and regulations thereunder."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broad powers granted the Commission under these provisions are plainly adequate to give it the control it reserved in this case over the fees incident to the exchange of the old securities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  Bond &amp;amp; Share asked that it be reimbursed by Electric for this fee. The Commission denied reimbursement, saying that Bond &amp;amp; Share's services in the proceedings "were not services merely designated to bring Electric into compliance with the Commission's order but were additionally, if not primarily, steps designed to simplify the Bond and Share system and Bond and Share itself at the apex of that system. . . . Any plan for the compliance of the subholding companies must necessarily have been as a step toward the ultimate resolution of Bond and Share's overall Section 11 problems which were its primary concern." Bond &amp;amp; Share took no step to contest that action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  Bond &amp;amp; Share asked $100,000 for Drexel. The Commission awarded $50,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9]  When Bond &amp;amp; Share asked Electric reimburse it for the fees paid Drexel (see note 7, &lt;i&gt;supra&lt;/i&gt;), it was following a traditional holdings company practice of using the affiliated companies as convenient pocketbooks of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

REPUBLIC OF CHINA ET AL.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;No. 30.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued November 9, 1954.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided March 7, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wm. Harvey Reeves&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Chauncey B. Garver.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Louis J. Gusmano&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondents. With him on a brief for the Republic of China were &lt;i&gt;Cletus Keating&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Robert E. Kline, Jr.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*357&lt;/span&gt; MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai-Nanking Railway Administration, an official agency of respondent Republic of China, established a $200,000 deposit account in 1948 with the New York head office of petitioner National City Bank of New York. Subsequently, respondent sought to withdraw the funds, but petitioner refused to pay, and respondent brought suit in Federal District Court under 48 Stat. 184, as amended, 12 U. S. C. &#167; 632.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to various defenses, petitioner interposed two counterclaims seeking an affirmative judgment for $1,634,432 on defaulted Treasury Notes of respondent owned by petitioner.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; After a plea of sovereign immunity, the District Court dismissed the counterclaims, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/nysd/8gn3/republic-of-china-v-national-city-bank-of-new-york/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;108&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;766&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and entered judgment on them pursuant to Rule 54 (b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Petitioner appealed, and while the appeal was pending sought leave from the District Court to amend the counterclaims by denominating them setoffs and including additional data. The District Court denied leave. 14 F. R. D. 186. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal and the denial on the ground that the counterclaims were not based on the subject matter of respondent's suit (whether they be treated as requests for affirmative &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*358&lt;/span&gt; relief or as setoffs) and, therefore, it would be an invasion of respondent's sovereign immunity for our courts to permit them to be pursued. 208 F. 2d 627. Because of the importance of the question and its first appearance in this Court, we granted certiorari.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; 347 U. S. 951.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The status of the Republic of China in our courts is a matter for determination by the Executive and is outside the competence of this Court. Accordingly, we start with the fact that the Republic and its governmental agencies enjoy a foreign sovereign's immunities to the same extent as any other country duly recognized by the United States. See &lt;i&gt;Guaranty Trust Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 304 U. S. 126, 137-138.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The freedom of a foreign sovereign from being haled into court as a defendant has impressive title-deeds. Very early in our history this immunity was recognized, &lt;i&gt;De Moitez&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;The South Carolina,&lt;/i&gt; Bee 422, 17 Fed. Cas. 574, No. 9,697 (Admiralty Court of Pa., 1781, Francis Hopkinson, J.), and it has since become part of the fabric of our law. It has become such solely through adjudications of this Court. Unlike the special position accorded our States as party defendants by the Eleventh Amendment, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*359&lt;/span&gt; the privileged position of a foreign state is not an explicit command of the Constitution. It rests on considerations of policy given legal sanction by this Court. To be sure, the nonsuability of the United States without its consent is likewise derived from considerations of policy. But these are of a different order from those that give a foreign nation such immunity. It is idle to repeat or rehearse the different considerations set forth in Mr. Chief Justice Marshall's classic opinion in &lt;i&gt;The Schooner Exchange&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;M'Faddon,&lt;/i&gt; 7 Cranch 116.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even the immunity enjoyed by the United States as territorial sovereign is a legal doctrine which has not been favored by the test of time. It has increasingly been found to be in conflict with the growing subjection of governmental action to the moral judgment. A reflection of this steady shift in attitude toward the American sovereign's immunity is found in such observations in unanimous opinions of this Court as "Public opinion as to the peculiar rights and preferences due to the sovereign has changed," &lt;i&gt;Davis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pringle,&lt;/i&gt; 268 U. S. 315, 318; "There is no doubt an intermittent tendency on the part of governments to be a little less grasping than they have been in the past . . . ," &lt;i&gt;White&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mechanics Securities Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 269 U. S. 283, 301; ". . . the present climate of opinion . . . has brought governmental immunity from suit into disfavor . . . ," &lt;i&gt;Keifer &amp;amp; Keifer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Reconstruction Finance Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 306 U. S. 381, 391. This chilly feeling against sovereign immunity began to reflect itself in federal legislation in 1797.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; At that early day Congress decided that when the United States sues an individual, the individual can set off all debts properly due him from the sovereign. And because of the objections to &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt; legislative allowance of private claims, Congress a hundred &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*360&lt;/span&gt; years ago created the Court of Claims,&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; where the United States, like any other obligor, may affirmatively be held to its undertakings. This amenability to suit has become a commonplace in regard to the various agencies which carry out "the enlarged scope of government in economic affairs," &lt;i&gt;Keifer &amp;amp; Keifer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Reconstruction Finance Corp., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 390. The substantive sweep of amenability to judicial process has likewise grown apace.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outlook and feeling thus reflected are not merely relevant to our problem. They are important. The claims of dominant opinion rooted in sentiments of justice and public morality are among the most powerful shaping-forces in lawmaking by courts. Legislation and adjudication are interacting influences in the development of law. A steady legislative trend, presumably manifesting a strong social policy, properly makes demands on the judicial process. See James M. Landis, Statutes and the Sources of Law, in Harvard Legal Essays (1934), p. 213 &lt;i&gt;et seq.;&lt;/i&gt; Harlan F. Stone, The Common Law in the United States, 50 Harv. L. Rev. 4, 13-16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More immediately touching the evolution of legal doctrines regarding a foreign sovereign's immunity is the restrictive policy that our State Department has taken toward the claim of such immunity. As the responsible agency for the conduct of foreign affairs, the State Department is the normal means of suggesting to the courts that a sovereign be granted immunity from a particular suit. &lt;i&gt;Ex parte Republic of Peru,&lt;/i&gt; 318 U. S. 578, 581. Its failure or refusal to suggest such immunity has been accorded significant weight by this Court. See &lt;i&gt;Compania Espanola de Navigacion Maritima, S. A.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;The Navemar,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*361&lt;/span&gt; 303 U. S. 68; &lt;i&gt;Republic of Mexico&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hoffman,&lt;/i&gt; 324 U. S. 30. And this for the reason that a major consideration for the rule enunciated in &lt;i&gt;The Schooner Exchange&lt;/i&gt; is the embarrassing consequences which judicial rejection of a claim of sovereign immunity may have on diplomatic relations. Recently the State Department has pronounced broadly against recognizing sovereign immunity for the commercial operations of a foreign government, 26 Dept. State Bull. 984 (1952), despite the fact that this Court thirty years earlier rejected the weighty opinion of Judge Mack in &lt;i&gt;The Pesaro,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;277&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;473&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (see, also his opinion in &lt;i&gt;The Gloria,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;286&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;188&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), for differentiating between commercial and war vessels of governments. &lt;i&gt;Berizzi Bros. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Steamship Pesaro,&lt;/i&gt; 271 U. S. 562.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so we come to the immediate situation before us. The short of the matter is that we are not dealing with an attempt to bring a recognized foreign government into one of our courts as a defendant and subject it to the rule of law to which nongovernmental obligors must bow. We have a foreign government invoking our law but resisting a claim against it which fairly would curtail its recovery.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; It wants our law, like any other &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*362&lt;/span&gt; litigant, but it wants our law free from the claims of justice. It becomes vital, therefore, to examine the extent to which the considerations which led this Court to bar a suit against a sovereign in &lt;i&gt;The Schooner Exchange&lt;/i&gt; are applicable here to foreclose a court from determining, according to prevailing law, whether the Republic of China's claim against the National City Bank would be unjustly enforced by disregarding legitimate claims against the Republic of China. As expounded in &lt;i&gt;The Schooner Exchange,&lt;/i&gt; the doctrine is one of implied consent by the territorial sovereign to exempt the foreign sovereign from its "exclusive and absolute" jurisdiction, the implication deriving from standards of public morality, fair dealing, reciprocal self-interest, and respect for the "power and dignity" of the foreign sovereign.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*363&lt;/span&gt; (a) The Court of Claims is available to foreign nationals (or their governments) on a simple condition: that the foreign national's government can be sued in its courts on claims by our citizens.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; An American or a Chinese&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; could sue in the Court of Claims for default on a United States bond, 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1491 (4), or could counterclaim&#151;to the extent of the Government's claim&#151;in a suit by the United States in any court, 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2406; see &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wilkins,&lt;/i&gt; 6 Wheat. 135; cf. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bank of the Metropolis,&lt;/i&gt; 15 Pet. 377; &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States F. &amp;amp; G. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 309 U. S. 506, 511. Thus it seems only fair to subject a foreign sovereign, coming into our courts by its own choice, to a liability substantially less than our own Government long ago willingly assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) The Republic of China is apparently suable on contract claims in its own courts,&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; and Americans have the same rights as Chinese in those courts.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; No parochial bias is manifest in our courts which would make it an affront to the "power and dignity" of the Republic of China for us to subject it to counterclaims in our courts when it entertains affirmative suits in its own. Decisions of the Chinese courts which seem to grant absolute &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*364&lt;/span&gt; immunity from direct suit to foreign sovereign&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt; are inapposite in this context and in light of our State Department's reluctance to raise the defense of sovereign immunity in foreign courts, see 26 Dept. State Bull. 984, 985 (1952); cf. 41 Stat. 527, 46 U. S. C. &#167; 747.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(c) Respondent urges that fiscal management falls within the category of immune operations of a foreign government as defined by the State Department's 1952 pronouncement. This is not to be denied, but it is beside the point. A sovereign has freely come as a suitor into our courts; our State Department neither has been asked nor has it given the slightest intimation that in its judgment allowance of counterclaims in such a situation would embarrass friendly relations with the Republic of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(d) It is recognized that a counterclaim based on the subject matter of a sovereign's suit is allowed to cut into the doctrine of immunity.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt; This is proof positive that the doctrine is not absolute, and that considerations of fair play must be taken into account in its application. But the limitation of "based on the subject matter" is too indeterminate, indeed too capricious, to mark the bounds of the limitations on the doctrine of sovereign immunity. There is great diversity among courts on what is and what is not a claim "based on the subject matter of the suit" or "growing out of the same transaction." See Clark, Code Pleading (2d ed.), 653-660; cf. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;National City Bank of New York,&lt;/i&gt; 83 F. 2d 236 (C. A. 2d Cir.). No doubt the present counterclaims cannot fairly be deemed to be related to the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*365&lt;/span&gt; Railway Agency's deposit of funds except insofar as the transactions between the Republic of China and the petitioner may be regarded as aspects of a continuous business relationship. The point is that the ultimate thrust of the consideration of fair dealing which allows a setoff or counterclaim based on the same subject matter reaches the present situation. The considerations found controlling in &lt;i&gt;The Schooner Exchange&lt;/i&gt; are not here present, and no consent to immunity can properly be implied. This conclusion was anticipated by Mr. Justice Washington on circuit four years after he had been of the Court which decided &lt;i&gt;The Schooner Exchange.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*366&lt;/span&gt; The judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed and the case remanded to the District Court with directions to reinstate the counterclaims and for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE REED, with whom MR. JUSTICE BURTON and MR. JUSTICE CLARK join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some data must be premised if discussion is to be confined to a reasonable space. We start with the postulate that the sovereign is released from the jurisdiction of its own courts except as it may specifically submit itself to their power.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That does not create a situation of irresponsibility. Satisfaction of sovereign liability may be had through the legislative organ which recognizes a moral obligation to pay the creditors of the government and to compensate those injured by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sovereign's freedom from judicial control does not arise from or depend upon the will of the courts. As was said in &lt;i&gt;The Schooner Exchange&lt;/i&gt; in speaking of the immunity of a foreign government, it depends upon "the will of the sovereign of the territory." ". . . all exemptions &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*367&lt;/span&gt; from territorial jurisdiction, must be derived from the consent of the sovereign . . . ." 7 Cranch 116, 138, 143. The immunity rests on the ground that no enforceable right exists "against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends."&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for the sovereign's consent to the exclusion of foreign sovereignties from the general jurisdiction of its courts was said by Chief Justice Marshall to rest on this proposition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The world being composed of distinct sovereignties, possessing equal rights and equal independence, whose mutual benefit is promoted by intercourse with each other, and by an interchange of those good offices which humanity dictates and its wants require, all sovereigns have consented to a relaxation in practice, in cases under certain peculiar circumstances, of that absolute and complete jurisdiction within their respective territories which sovereignty confers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This consent may, in some instances, be tested by common usage, and by common opinion, growing out of that usage." 7 Cranch, at 136.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be summarized by the word "comity."&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; The local sovereign may, of course, withdraw such consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Without doubt, the sovereign of the place is capable of destroying this implication. He may claim and exercise jurisdiction either by employing force, or by subjecting such vessels to the ordinary tribunal. But until such power be exerted in a manner not to be misunderstood, the sovereign cannot be considered &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*368&lt;/span&gt; as having imparted to the ordinary tribunal a jurisdiction, which it would be a breach of faith to exercise." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 146.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ancillary principle of law is that, in determining whether a defendant is a sovereign, the courts follow the guidance of the political branch.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; In this case the sovereignty of the Republic of China is not questioned. Furthermore, the Chinese Government Treasury Note and its 36th Year Short Term Treasury Notes upon which the City Bank's counterclaims rest are sovereign obligations, &lt;i&gt;jure imperii&lt;/i&gt; in form, of the highest public character. Consequently, the attitude of the Department of State as to the desirability of relaxing the strict rule of immunity as to acts of commerce, &lt;i&gt;jure gestionis,&lt;/i&gt; is inapplicable. See 26 Dept. State Bull. 984 (1952), referred to in the Court's opinion, p. 361.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the foregoing statements of law are sound, the Republic of China as a foreign sovereign is free from direct suits in our courts on the notes here in question unless the Congress of the United States has enacted a statute that restricts its immunity. This it has not done. The question in this case thus comes down to whether the Republic of China, by bringing this suit for the recovery of a bank deposit, waived its immunity and subjected itself to a counterclaim under the Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., Rule 13. Under the words of &#167; (c) of that Rule, judgment over against the Republic of China would seem to be authorized if the counterclaim were for more than plaintiff's claim. But there would be no jurisdiction to render such judgment in an American court. It would violate the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*369&lt;/span&gt; immunity of a foreign sovereign to do so.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; In the present case, the Court evidently feels that, since the counterclaims is limited to the amount of the Republic of China's claim, there is jurisdiction to allow a setoff to that extent. But the mere fact that a judgment over is not sought should not be relied upon to avoid the jurisdictional immunity of a foreign sovereign. I find no justification for the Court's restricting that immunity in the absence of legislative or executive action.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*370&lt;/span&gt; Affirmative legislative action was necessary to allow such a limited setoff against the United States.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; Action of a similar nature should be required to authorize this setoff. The comity that gave the foreign sovereign full immunity from process was, as &lt;i&gt;The Schooner Exchange&lt;/i&gt; pointed out, p. 146, only to be withdrawn "in a manner not to be misunderstood." That is by legislation.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; The judicial creation of such jurisdiction over the property of a friendly nation might well merit the stricture of Chief Justice Marshall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A nation would justly be considered as violating its faith, although that faith might not be expressly plighted, which should suddenly and without previous notice, exercise its territorial powers in a manner not consonant to the usages and received obligations of the civilized world." 7 Cranch, at 137.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International relations are pre-eminently a matter of public policy. Judicial views of supposed public interests are not the touchstone whereby to determine the law.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*371&lt;/span&gt; The change from a generous to a parsimonious application of the principle of sovereign immunity should come from Congress or the Executive. Our courts possess great powers and have solemn obligations. Our country allots power to the judiciary in the confidence that, in view of the separation of powers, judicial authority will not undertake determinations which are the primary concern of other branches of our Government. Differences of view exist as to the desirable scope of sovereign immunity and the necessity for non judicial determinations.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; But surely it is better that the decisions be left to those organs of Government that have the responsibility for determining public policy in carrying out foreign affairs. The establishment of political or economic policies is not for the courts. Such action would be an abuse of judicial power. It is only by a conscious and determined purpose to keep the functions of the various branches of government separate that the courts can most effectively carry out their duties. I would leave this question of the jurisdictional immunity of foreign sovereigns to the other branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court determines, however, that the question of changing the limitation of the immunity of foreign sovereigns pertains to its functions. Even on the assumption that such is a proper matter for judicial concern, I would reach a different conclusion than does the Court. If a direct suit cannot be brought against a foreign sovereign (as is conceded), why should we allow the same claim to be used as an offset to destroy the sovereign's right to recover? Why should the City Bank be able to assert its notes against the Republic of China, even defensively, when other noteholders not obligated to the sovereign are prevented from collecting their notes? &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*372&lt;/span&gt; Here we have an entirely disconnected claim on overdue national notes brought forward as a defense to an action to recover a bank deposit. The Court recognizes that the counterclaim is not related to China's cause of action against the City Bank. It says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The point is that the ultimate thrust of the consideration of fair dealing which allows a setoff or counterclaim based on the same subject matter reaches the present situation."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The counterclaim here is of much the same character as a suit against a foreign sovereign. Deposits may be the lifeblood necessary for national existence. It is not wise for us to tell the nations of the world that any assets they may have in the United States, now or in the future, upon which suit must be brought, are subject to every counterclaim their debtors can acquire against them at par or at a discount. It is unfair to our foreign friends and detrimental to our own financial and mercantile interests. For fairness we need not go beyond the allowance of counterclaims arising out of transactions foreign sovereigns seek to enforce in our courts. It seems to me that the Court sanctions a circuitous evasion of the well-established rule prohibiting direct suits against foreign sovereigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would affirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The Treasury Note on which the first counterclaim is based was pledged by the Republic of China in 1920 to secure a loan to the Pacific Development Company by a banking syndicate in which petitioner participated. The loan was not repaid, and during the liquidation of the Development Company the syndicate bought the collateral at a public sale. The Treasury Notes on which the second counterclaim is based were purchased by petitioner's Shanghai branch at the time of issue in 1947-1948. The record allows us to assume that the petitioner gave full value as its share of the loan to the Development Company and bought the notes in the second counterclaim at par.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  At the outset respondent argues that since petitioner on certiorari has dropped its demand for affirmative relief, the case is not properly before us. It is conceded that dismissal of independent counterclaims would ordinarily contain the requisite finality on which to base our jurisdiction, but respondent contends that when petitioner reduced its counterclaims to mere demands for setoff, the claims became defenses and, as such, non reviewable until the respondent's suit had been concluded below. We reject this view. A counterclaim does not dwindle to a defense solely because it is confined&#151;as a result of the accepted jurisprudence of sovereign immunity, see &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Shaw,&lt;/i&gt; 309 U. S. 495&#151;to reducing the sovereign's recovery. The District Court's judgment, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, terminated a separable and distinct segment of the litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the cited American decisions, only two district court cases directly involved the dismissal of counterclaims not based on the subject matter of the sovereign's suit and not seeking affirmative judgment: &lt;i&gt;Republic of China&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pang-Tsu Mow, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York Trust Co., supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Privy Council recently rejected the view of Lord Justice Scrutton in &lt;i&gt;The Jupiter,&lt;/i&gt; [1924] P. 236 (C. A.), that the mere assertion of a claim by a foreign government to property the subject of an action by a private party compels the court to stay the action and decline jurisdiction. &lt;i&gt;Juan Ysmael &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Republic of Indonesia,&lt;/i&gt; [1954] 3 W.

&lt;p&gt;[14]  The case is &lt;i&gt;King of Spain&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Oliver,&lt;/i&gt; 1 Pet. C. C. 276, 14 Fed. Cas. 572, No. 7,813 (C. C. D. Pa.). The King of Spain had sued two Americans for duties he alleged they owed him on shipments of goods they had made to the Spanish American colonies under royal licenses. The defendants replied that they had obtained the licenses from and paid the duties to Hope &amp;amp; Co., a Dutch concern which had a commercial concession from the King in return for which it had promised, &lt;i&gt;inter alia,&lt;/i&gt; to pay duties on shipments to the colonies. Hope had also negotiated a loan for the King in what appears to have been an unrelated transaction, and the King had pledged all his public revenues to repay the loan. Instead of handing over the duties received from defendants to the King, Hope applied them to reduce the debt due from the King on the loan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Justice Washington directed a verdict for the defendants. First he held that there was no privity of contract between the defendants and the King, so that payment to Hope discharged them. But assuming that there was privity he ruled that the duties had been properly applied by Hope to reduce the King's debt to it. "Let it be, as was argued, that the consent of the Spanish government, under the administration of Joseph [Bonaparte, who had, while in power, agreed that the duties be applied to reduce the debt], was invalid and of no obligation upon Ferdinand; still, Ferdinand, as the &lt;i&gt;successor of his father&lt;/i&gt; [Charles IV, to whom the loan had been made], and the nation, were and are bound to pay the debt due in Holland; and if it has been in part discharged, out of funds charged with the payment of it [because they were public revenues], in the hands of Hope and Co., the payments of the duties, have in effect been made to the plaintiff, because he owes, of the debt due in Holland, less than what was originally due, by the amount of duties which were applied to its discharge by Hope and Co. After such an application, which I repeat it, Hope and Co. were authorised to make, under all the circumstances of the case, this action cannot be supported, to recover the amount of the duties so appropriated." 1 Pet.

In &lt;i&gt;South African Republic&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;La Compagnie Franco-Belge,&lt;/i&gt; [1898] 1 Ch. 190, 198, a foreign sovereign sued to enjoin the use of deposited funds. On a counterclaim not connected with the issue concerning the funds, Mr. Justice North held the foreign government could not be sued, citing &lt;i&gt;Duke of Brunswick&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;King of Hanover,&lt;/i&gt; 6 Beav. 68, and &lt;i&gt;Strousberg&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Republic of Costa Rica,&lt;/i&gt; 29 Weekly Reporter 125, 44 L. T. R. (N. S.) 199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  Probably because it is obvious that there is no tenable distinction between the setoff of an unrelated claim, a proceeding for a judgment over on a counterclaim, and a direct suit against a foreign sovereign, few cases have dealt with this phase of the immunity of a foreign sovereign from claims. None that have discussed the issue have reached the result which the Court takes today. In addition to the two cases cited in note 6 of the majority opinion, the same issue here presented was considered and decided in accord with my position in the only foreign case discussing the issue that has come to my attention. In &lt;i&gt;The State of Belgium&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;E. A. G. de Badts,&lt;/i&gt; Nederlandsche Jurisprudentie, 1923, p. 618, Ann. Dig. of Pub. Int'l Law Cases 1919-1922, p. 129, the Belgian Government, a foreign sovereign, brought suit in the Dutch courts for an account of the sale of a certain cargo of wheat. The defendant sought to set off an entirely unrelated claim which he had against the Belgian Government. The court held:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That the Court had no jurisdiction to take cognisance of the counterclaim against the Belgian State. A State which is entitled to claim immunity from foreign jurisdiction does not lose this right by the fact that it submits to that jurisdiction in another suit. The correctness of this statement is not impaired by the circumstance that the two actions are, for the sake of convenience, joined in the same proceedings, since the counter-claim does not lose, in consequence thereof, its independent character. This is so particularly in cases in which the plaintiff Government bases its claim on a private law title, but in counter-claim is sued for acts performed in its sovereign capacity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor can the majority derive much support from &lt;i&gt;King of Spain&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Oliver,&lt;/i&gt; 1 Pet. C. C. 276, cited on p. 365, n. 14, of the Court's opinion. The question of sovereign immunity was not considered or even mentioned in that case, since no setoff or counterclaim was asserted against the foreign sovereign. The court simply held that payment, in the manner and under the circumstances there presented, was a good defense to a suit on a debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner refused to testify before a New York grand jury which was investigating the alleged association of city policemen with criminals, racketeers, and gamblers in Kings County. He was convicted of criminal contempt and sentenced to one year's imprisonment. We granted certiorari, 347 U. S. 1010, to determine whether, under the circumstances here presented, petitioner was deprived of his liberty without due process of law in being punished for his refusal to testify. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Adamson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;California,&lt;/i&gt; 332 U. S. 46, 54.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following New York constitutional and statutory provisions are essential to an understanding of the case. Article I, &#167; 6, of the Constitution of the State of New York provides, in part, that no person shall "be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself."&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Section 381 of the New York Penal Law, as it existed at the time of this case, provided that testimony relating to bribery could not be withheld on the ground of self-incrimination, but conferred immunity from prosecution for any criminal activity revealed in such testimony.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Section 903 of the Charter of the City of New York provides that any city employee who refuses to sign a waiver of his immunity against subsequent prosecution upon any matter of an official nature about which he is asked to testify shall lose his job and be disqualified from future employment with the city. Article I, &#167; 6, of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*60&lt;/span&gt; the Constitution of the State of New York contains a provision much to the same effect.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner was first called to testify before the grand jury on March 7, 1951. He was then a member of the Police Department of the City of New York. Prior to being sworn, he signed a waiver of immunity against prosecution.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; After being sworn, he testified that the waiver had been executed voluntarily and with full understanding as to its meaning. He was given a financial questionnaire and directed to return with it completely &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*61&lt;/span&gt; filled out on March 28, 1951. On March 27, 1951, his connection with the police department was severed. His next appearance before the grand jury was on October 22, 1952, when he was given another questionnaire and instructed to return it in completed form by November 12, 1952. On November 12 he asked for an extension of time and his request was granted.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; On December 21, 1952, he was once again before the grand jury. On that occasion, he was asked the following question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"While you were a plainclothesman in the Police Department of the City of New York did you ever accept or receive any bribes from bookmakers or other gamblers?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner refused to answer the question on the ground that his answer might tend to incriminate him. He made a statement in which he claimed that his waiver of immunity was invalid since he had not understood its significance when he signed it, and no one had explained it to him. He expressed doubt as to his status as a witness and his privileges and duties as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner was taken before the County Court of Kings County to clarify his status. It was there held, after a hearing, that the waiver was valid because petitioner had fully understood its significance when he signed it. Petitioner was directed to answer the question which he had been asked. He returned to the grand jury, but persisted in his refusal to testify. He was thereupon indicted for criminal contempt, tried by a jury, and convicted. His conviction was affirmed by the Appellate Division in a short memorandum opinion, 282 App. Div. 775, 122 N. Y. S. 2d 478, and by the New York Court of Appeals without opinion, 306 N. Y. 747, 117 N. E. 2d 921. The Court of Appeals did amend its remittitur to show that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*62&lt;/span&gt; the question of whether petitioner had been deprived of liberty without due process of law had been raised and passed upon. 306 N. Y. 875, 119 N. E. 2d 45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner contends that this Court must here determine whether the Fourteenth Amendment prevents a State from imprisoning an individual for refusing to give self-incriminatory testimony. In so doing he ignores the crucial significance of the immunity statute in this case. We simply hold that under the circumstances here presented petitioner was not deprived of any constitutional rights in being punished for his refusal to testify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immunity statute is crucial in this case because it removed any possible justification which petitioner had for not testifying. If petitioner had not executed a waiver of immunity, it is clear beyond dispute that he would have had to testify;&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; the statute would have provided him with immunity from prosecution on the matters on which his testimony was sought, and thus his testimony could not possibly have been self-incriminatory.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; The waiver of immunity, although it does affect the possibility of subsequent prosecution, does not alter petitioner's underlying obligation to testify. Much of the argument before this Court has been directed at the question of whether the waiver of immunity was valid or invalid, voluntary or coerced, effectual or ineffectual. That question is irrelevant to the disposition of this case for on either assumption the requirement to testify, imposed by the grant of immunity, remains unimpaired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, assume that the waiver was valid. Any testimony which the petitioner gave could then have formed the basis for a subsequent prosecution, and the State would here be punishing the petitioner for his refusal to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*63&lt;/span&gt; provide such self-incriminatory testimony. But, since we are assuming the validity of the waiver, such a situation would be simply the result of a voluntary choice to waive an immunity provided by the State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waiver of immunity from prosecution may, on the other hand, be regarded as invalid. Petitioner argues at some length that the waiver was obtained by a "pattern of duress and lack of understanding." He points to the circumstances attending the signing of the waiver: the size of the room, the number of policemen who simultaneously executed waivers, the speed with which the waivers were obtained, the lack of counsel, etc.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; He also points to the provisions of the New York Constitution and the City Charter requiring him to sign the waiver or lose his job.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; In addition he claims that the waiver was stale and thus ineffective since over 21 months had elapsed from the date of its execution to his refusal to testify. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*64&lt;/span&gt; We fail to see where petitioner's arguments lead. If the waiver is invalid, the immunity from prosecution persists, and in the presence of such immunity petitioner's testimony could not possibly be self-incriminatory. It must be remembered that this conviction is for refusing to testify. The invalidity of the waiver may be made a defense to subsequent prosecution, where it would be a proper matter for disposition; it is no defense to a refusal to testify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner suggests that his refusal to testify may have been justified by the uncertainty existing at the time he was directed to testify. That uncertainty was only as to whether or not he could be prosecuted for criminal activity which might be revealed in his testimony. As a matter of state law, a defense to the crime of criminal contempt may be provided when such uncertainty reaches a sufficiently high point.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; But the Constitution does not require the definitive resolution of collateral questions as a condition precedent to a valid contempt conviction. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Cobbledick&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 309 U. S. 323, 327. The petitioner knew that however the question of the validity of the waiver might be resolved, he was obliged to testify. In persisting in his refusal after being directed to testify he could be punished for contempt. The law strives to provide predictability so that knowing men may wisely order their affairs; it cannot, however, remove all doubts as to the consequence of a course of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment below is accordingly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER concurs in the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*65&lt;/span&gt; MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, with whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK joins, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I concur in the opinion and judgment of the Court, but would add that substantial federal questions may arise if the petitioner is again called upon to testify concerning bribery on the police force while he was an officer and if he is thereafter denied immunity as to any offenses related to the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Court has never held that a State, in the absence of an adequate immunity statute, can punish a witness for contempt for refusing to answer self-incriminatory questions. A case involving such facts has never been presented here.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Nor is this such a case, since New York, by &#167; 381 of the Penal Law, has granted immunity. Petitioner was obliged to answer the questions as would be any witness in the State of New York. If he had signed no waiver, he concededly would have been compelled to testify, since under &#167; 381 of the New York Penal Law he would be entitled to immunity. The fact that he signed a waiver, even assuming it to be invalid as he claims, certainly cannot relieve him from the duty of every citizen to testify. His failure to so testify, therefore, placed him in contempt of court and subject to the punishment accorded him in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, because it appears from the record to be the intention of the authorities to punish him both for contempt &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*66&lt;/span&gt; for refusal to testify and for bribery if he admits such misconduct, we might eventually be faced with the question of what his rights would be if on a subsequent hearing he should incriminate himself after claiming a privilege against self-incrimination. Petitioner might defend against a prosecution stemming from such involuntary testimony by challenging the validity of the waiver, basing his objection on an asserted federal right against self-incrimination. Such a challenge might well embrace the contention made here of coercion in the procurement of the waiver, as well as the claim that its use well beyond the term of petitioner's public employment would be an unreasonable interference with petitioner's claimed federal right.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a state immunity statute&#151;like any other state statute&#151;must be applied uniformly unless there is some reasonable ground for classification; otherwise, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is violated.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; After a city employee suffers the primary sanction of the constitutional and charter sections&#151; namely, loss of his position&#151;it may well be that the waiver cannot be used to send him to the penitentiary for bribery when the same sanction would not be imposed on other witnesses giving like testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as already noted, we do not reach these questions here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concurs, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to keep his job as a New York City policeman petitioner signed a paper waiving immunity he would otherwise have had from prosecution under state law as &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*67&lt;/span&gt; to matters he might testify about before a grand jury. Twenty-two months later, long after he had resigned as a policeman, he was brought before a county grand jury. He was asked whether he had ever accepted bribes while he was a policeman. Acceptance of bribes is a New York felony punishable by ten years' imprisonment. Petitioner refused to answer the questions claiming a federal constitutional and state privilege against self-incrimination. For refusal to answer he was sentenced to twelve months in prison. The Court holds that New York can thus imprison petitioner "for his refusal to provide such self-incriminatory testimony." I do not agree that New York can do this consistently with the Federal Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reasons stated on other occasions I believe the Fourteenth Amendment makes the Fifth Amendment applicable to the States. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Adamson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;California,&lt;/i&gt; 332 U. S. 46, 68. And the Fifth Amendment accords an unqualified privilege to persons to be silent when asked questions answers to which would make those persons witnesses against themselves. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blau&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 340 U. S. 159, 161. Even under the other view of the Fourteenth Amendment, that it does not make the Fifth Amendment applicable to the States and that under some circumstances States may compel persons to testify against themselves, this Court has held many times that a State may not convict a person on testimony it coerced from him. &lt;i&gt;E. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leyra&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Denno,&lt;/i&gt; 347 U. S. 556, 558; &lt;i&gt;Ashcraft&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tennessee,&lt;/i&gt; 322 U. S. 143, 155; cf. &lt;i&gt;Rochin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;California,&lt;/i&gt; 342 U. S. 165. Coercing testimony for that purpose is equally obnoxious to the Fourteenth Amendment. However its action is described, the State is seeking to coerce this petitioner to give testimony to help bring about his conviction for crime. For it is certainly coercion to throw a man into jail unless he agrees to testify against himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*68&lt;/span&gt; The Court approves the dilemma in which New York places petitioner. He must give evidence which might convict him of a felony or go to jail for refusing to give that evidence. The Court says, however, that petitioner's dilemma is "simply the result of a voluntary choice to waive an immunity provided by the State." There of course may be some doubt as to how "voluntary" this "choice" was. In any event it is a completely novel idea that a waiver device of this kind can destroy constitutional protections. It is nothing more nor less than a wholesale blanket agreement that a person will not claim a constitutional privilege with reference to anything he has ever done in the past or that he may do in the future in connection with his job. So far as I know it has never been held before that the privilege against self-incrimination or any other Bill of Rights safeguard can be bargained away far in advance of the day when needed as protection against the overreaching power of government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court's holding appears to approve a dangerous technique whereby both State and Federal Governments can compel people to convict themselves out of their own mouths. Are we to infer that the Federal Government is now free to compel its millions of employees permanently to waive their privilege against self-incrimination or lose their jobs? Surely private employers are not now free to compel their employees to waive this and other constitutional privileges. This might be highly satisfactory to those who believe that the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination has no proper place in our Bill of Rights. But that provision was designed as a continuing rigid safeguard against ruthless exercise of governmental power.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; That it sometimes permits people &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*69&lt;/span&gt; to escape conviction for offenses is no sufficient reason for reading it out of the Constitution. Those who wrote the provision are bound to have known that it would have the effect of making it harder for the Government to convict people accused of crime. Exactly that effect results from all of the procedural provisions of the Bill of Rights, including the right to be heard, to have a lawyer, to be confronted by witnesses, to be informed of the nature of the offense charged, and to be tried by jury. This holding weakens these and other ancient safeguards which to me represent great landmarks in the never-ceasing struggle of men to be free from despotic governmental powers. See dissent in &lt;i&gt;Feldman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 322 U. S. 487, 494-503.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I, Michael J. Regan, of No. 3819 Harper Avenue, Bronx, . . . of The City of New York pursuant to the provisions of Section 2446 of the Penal Law of the State of New York, do hereby waive all immunity which I would otherwise obtain from indictment, prosecution, punishment, penalty or forfeiture for or on account of or relating to any transaction, matter or thing concerning which I may testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, before the Grand Jury of the County of Kings, in its investigation above entitled or in any other investigation or other proceeding, before any judge or justice, court or other tribunal, conducting an inquiry for legal proceeding relating to the acts of said John Doe, Michael J. Regan, or of any other person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I do hereby further waive any and all privileges which I would otherwise obtain against the use against me of the testimony so given or the evidence so produced upon any criminal investigation, prosecution or proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[7]  Petitioner does not challenge the sufficiency of the immunity provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  There was testimony that the waiver was obtained in a room which measured "10 x 10, or 12 x 12, approximately," containing a desk "about 60 x 2" [&lt;i&gt;sic&lt;/i&gt;] and a bench upon which "about five people could sit." About 35 waivers were obtained in a period of 25 minutes. An assistant district attorney made a single speech explaining the nature of the immunity. Immediately after executing the waiver, petitioner testified that he had signed the waiver voluntarily, that it had been explained to him, and that he understood its meaning. Twenty months thereafter petitioner reaffirmed its execution without raising any objection to its validity. It was some twenty-one months after its execution that petitioner challenged the validity of the waiver for the first time. The trial court left the question of the validity of the waiver to the jury. Its verdict of guilty indicates its finding on this matter. The conviction was affirmed by both appellate courts, but we cannot be sure that the affirmance sustained the finding on this matter for the appellate courts may have viewed the question of the validity of the waiver as irrelevant to their decision as we do to ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9]  It might be pointed out that, as far as the record shows, this objection was at no point raised below. It appears for the first time in the Petition for Certiorari.&lt;/p&gt;

As I have already pointed out, the establishment of the privilege is closely linked historically with the abolition of torture. Now we look upon torture with abhorrence.

&lt;center&gt;No. 374.&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Argued March 31, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided April 25 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oscar H. Davis&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. On the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Olney, John F. Davis, Beatrice Rosenberg&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Edward S. Szukelewicz.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aaron L. Danzig&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*49&lt;/span&gt; MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After administrative hearings, the respondent Pedreiro, an alien, was ordered deported under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; He petitioned the District Court for the Southern District of New York to review the deportation order, declare it void and issue a temporary injunction restraining its execution pending final district court action. In part he contended that there was no legal evidence to support the order and that in violation of due process he had been compelled to incriminate himself in the hearings. Relief was sought only against the District Director of Immigration and Naturalization for the District of New York. The District Court dismissed the petition on the ground that either the Attorney General or the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization was an indispensable party and should have been joined. This holding made it unnecessary for the District Court to pass on another ground urged for dismissal, that the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 precluded judicial review of deportation orders by any method except habeas corpus. The Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting both contentions of the Government. 213 F. 2d 768. In doing so it followed the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit which had held that deportation orders entered under the 1952 Immigration Act can be judicially reviewed in actions for declaratory relief under &#167; 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rubinstein&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Brownell,&lt;/i&gt; 92 U. S. App. D. C. 328, 206 F. 2d 449, affirmed by an equally divided Court, 346 U. S. 929. But the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has held that habeas corpus is the only way such deportation orders can be attacked. &lt;i&gt;Batista&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*50&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Nicolls,&lt;/i&gt; 213 F. 2d 20. Because of this conflict among the circuits and the contention that allowing judicial review of deportation orders other than by habeas corpus conflicts with &lt;i&gt;Heikkila&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Barber,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 229, we granted certiorari, 348 U. S. 882.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Heikkila&lt;/i&gt; case, unlike this one, dealt with a deportation order under the Immigration Act of 1917. That Act provided that deportation orders of the Attorney General should be "final"&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; and had long been interpreted as precluding any type of judicial review except by habeas corpus. Heikkila contended that this narrow right of review of deportation orders under the 1917 Act had been broadened by &#167; 10 of the 1946 Administrative Procedure Act which authorizes review of agency action by any appropriate method "except so far as (1) statutes preclude judicial review . . . ." Because this Court had construed the word "final" in the 1917 Act as precluding any review except by habeas corpus, it held that the Administrative Procedure Act gave no additional remedy since &#167; 10 excepted statutes that precluded judicial review. The Court carefully pointed out, however, that it did not consider whether the same result should be reached under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act "which took effect after Heikkila's complaint was filed."&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; Consequently &lt;i&gt;Heikkila&lt;/i&gt; does not control this case and we must consider the effect of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act on the right to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act provides that "Any person suffering legal wrong because of any agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by such action within the meaning of any relevant statute, shall be entitled to judicial review thereof." And &#167; 12 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*51&lt;/span&gt; of the Act provides that "No subsequent legislation shall be held to supersede or modify the provisions of this Act except to the extent that such legislation shall do so expressly." In the subsequent 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act there is no language which "expressly" supersedes or modifies the expanded right of review granted by &#167; 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act. But the 1952 Immigration Act does provide, as did the 1917 Act, that deportation orders of the Attorney General shall be "final." The Government contends that we should read this as expressing a congressional purpose to give the word "final" in the 1952 Act precisely the same meaning &lt;i&gt;Heikkila&lt;/i&gt; gave "final" in the 1917 Act and thereby continue to deprive deportees of all right of judicial review except by habeas corpus. We cannot accept this contention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a restrictive construction of the finality provision of the present Immigration Act would run counter to &#167; 10 and &#167; 12 of the Administrative Procedure Act. Their purpose was to remove obstacles to judicial review of agency action under subsequently enacted statutes like the 1952 Immigration Act. And as the Court said in the &lt;i&gt;Heikkila&lt;/i&gt; case, the Procedure Act is to be given a "hospitable" interpretation. In that case the Court also referred to ambiguity in the provision making deportation orders of the Attorney General "final." It is more in harmony with the generous review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act to construe the ambiguous word "final" in the 1952 Immigration Act as referring to finality in administrative procedure rather than as cutting off the right of judicial review in whole or in part. And it would certainly not be in keeping with either of these Acts to require a person ordered deported to go to jail in order to obtain review by a court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislative history of both the Administrative Procedure Act and the 1952 Immigration Act supports respondent's &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*52&lt;/span&gt; right to full judicial review of this deportation order. The sponsors of the Administrative Procedure Act were Representative Walter in the House and Senator McCarran in the Senate. They were also the sponsors of the 1952 Immigration Act. While the latter Act was under consideration in the House, an amendment was proposed which provided for liberal judicial review of deportation orders. Representative Walter assured the House that the proposed amendment was not needed. He said: "Now, we come to this question of the finality of the decision of the Attorney General. That language means that it is a final decision as far as the administrative branch of the Government is concerned, but it is not final in that it is not the last remedy that the alien has. Section 10 of the Administrative Procedures Act is applicable."&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; With reference to the same problem Senator McCarran assured the Senate that "the Administrative Procedure Act is made applicable to the bill."&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; It is argued that these assurances by the chairmen of the committees in charge of the bills were but isolated statements and that other legislative history is sufficient to refute them. We cannot agree. Our holding is that there is a right of judicial review of deportation orders other than by habeas corpus and that the remedy sought here is an appropriate one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also reject the Government's contention that the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization is an indispensable party to an action for declaratory relief of this kind.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; District Directors are authorized by regulation to issue warrants of deportation, to designate the country to which an alien shall be deported, and to determine when his mental or physical condition requires the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*53&lt;/span&gt; employment of a person to accompany him. The regulations purport to make these decisions of the District Director final.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; It seems highly appropriate, therefore, that the District Director charged with enforcement of a deportation order should represent the Government's interest. Otherwise in order to try his case an alien might be compelled to go to the District of Columbia to obtain jurisdiction over the Commissioner. To impose this burden on an alien about to be deported would be completely inconsistent with the basic policy of the Administrative Procedure Act to facilitate court review of such administrative action. We know of no necessity for such a harsh rule. Undoubtedly the Government's defense can be adequately presented by the District Director who is under the supervision of the Commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is argued, however, that the Commissioner should be an indispensable party because a judgment against a District Director alone would not be final and binding in other immigration districts. But we need not decide the effect of such a judgment. We cannot assume that a decision on the merits in a court of appeals on a question of this kind, subject to review by this Court, would be lightly disregarded by the immigration authorities. Nor is it to be assumed that a second effort to have the same issue decided in a habeas corpus proceeding would do any serious harm to the Government. In habeas corpus proceedings district courts would have the duty to consider previous court decisions on the same matter. And even though in extraordinary circumstances new matters not previously adjudicated may arise in habeas corpus proceedings, this is no adequate reason for subjecting an alien to the great burden of having to go with his witnesses to the District of Columbia, which may be far distant from his home, in order to contest his deportation. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*54&lt;/span&gt; Our former cases have established a policy under which indispensability of parties is determined on practical considerations. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Williams&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fanning,&lt;/i&gt; 332 U. S. 490. That policy followed here causes us to conclude that the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization is not an indispensable party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE MINTON, with whom MR. JUSTICE REED and MR. JUSTICE BURTON join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Heikkila&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Barber,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 229, this Court held that &#167; 19 (a) of the Immigration Act of 1917, making decisions of the Attorney General "final," was a statute which precluded judicial review within the meaning of the first exception to &#167; 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act. Now, slightly more than two years later, the Court holds that judicial review of deportation orders is available under &#167; 10 even though &#167; 242 (b) of the 1952 Act is a re-enactment, almost verbatim, of the "final" clause of the 1917 Act. The decision is based on three considerations. First, &#167; 12 of the Administrative Procedure Act provides that, "No subsequent legislation shall be held to supersede or modify the provisions of this Act except to the extent that such legislation shall do so expressly," and, in the opinion of the majority, there is no language in the 1952 Act which "expressly" establishes a more limited review. Second, it is believed more consistent with the liberal review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act to construe "final" as referring to finality in the administrative process. And third, isolated statements in the congressional debates indicate that Congress actually intended to permit review under the Administrative Procedure Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 12 of the Administrative Procedure Act, however, as I read it, applies only where subsequently enacted legislation, in the words of the Court, "supersedes or &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*55&lt;/span&gt; modifies the expanded right of review granted by &#167; 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act," and this Court held in the &lt;i&gt;Heikkila&lt;/i&gt; case that the rights of aliens subject to deportation were not enlarged by the Administrative Procedure Act. Moreover, notwithstanding significant substantive changes in the immigration laws in the 1952 Act, I hesitate to consider the re-enactment of a provision, with minor changes in language, "subsequently enacted legislation." The issue then is much like the one the Court faced in &lt;i&gt;Heikkila:&lt;/i&gt; whether, in the context of the liberal review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, Congress intended, by &#167; 242 (b), to preclude application of &#167; 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act. As this Court pointed out in &lt;i&gt;Heikkila,&lt;/i&gt; the word "final," though ambiguous in other contexts, as used in immigration legislation since the Immigration Act of 1891, has precluded judicial review except by habeas corpus. In view of this long history and the re-enactment of &#167; 242 with only minor textual changes, I hesitate to impute to Congress an intention to change the method of review absent a clear showing. The Court found in examining the legislative history that Representative Walter, one of the sponsors of the 1952 Act as well as of the Administrative Procedure Act, believed that &#167; 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act applied to deportation orders. The statement by Senator McCarran, however, that "the Administrative Procedure Act is made applicable to the bill," in context, may merely refer to the administrative procedures aspect of an amendment proposed by Senator Moody. 98 Cong. Rec. 5778, 5779. In any event, the statements of Congressman Walter and Senator McCarran, in the course of debate on the floor, are less persuasive than the more carefully prepared and authoritative committee report, and the report of the Senate Committee in charge of the bill would seem to indicate that no change in the law was intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*56&lt;/span&gt; The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was preceded by extensive studies of the structure and operation of the immigration law. These studies culminated in a report by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary entitled, The Immigration and Naturalization Systems of the United States, S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. It contains the following statement, at page 629:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;i&gt;Judicial review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Once the order and warrant of deportation are issued, the administrative process is complete. Under the fifth amendment to the Constitution, the `due process' provision, the alien may, however, petition for a writ of habeas corpus. In a habeas corpus proceeding, based on a deportation case, the court determines whether or not there has been a fair hearing, whether or not the law has been interpreted correctly, and whether or not there is substantial evidence to support the order of deportation. Habeas corpus is the proper remedy to determine the legality of the detention of an alien in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The dismissal of an application for a writ of habeas corpus is not a bar to the filing of another application before another judge."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this report was dated April 1950, it serves to clarify any ambiguity in the statement in the Senate report accompanying the bill in final form that judicial review in immigration cases was not expanded "beyond that under existing law." S. Rep. No. 1137, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. 28. The Committee, in using the phrase "existing law," particularly in light of the long history of exclusive habeas corpus review, was necessarily referring to the law as understood and expressed in its prior report. Moreover, the report also states, at page 30, that "The bill &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*57&lt;/span&gt; declares that the prescribed deportation proceedings shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining the deportability of any alien, notwithstanding the provisions of any other law." The legislative history, therefore, would seem to make it unmistakably clear that Congress, aware that the word "final" as used in immigration legislation was not ambiguous, intended to preserve habeas corpus as the only escape from a deportation order. It was error to give relief under the Administrative Procedure Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;No. 468.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued April 21, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided May 9, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;James R. Browning,&lt;/i&gt; acting under appointment by the Court, 348 U. S. 924, argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Charles F. Barber&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Beatrice Rosenberg&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Carl H. Imlay.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once more it becomes necessary to determine "What Congress has made the allowable unit of prosecution," &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Universal C. I. T. Credit Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 344 U. S. 218, 221, under a statute which does not explicitly give the answer. This recurring problem now arises under &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*82&lt;/span&gt; what is familiarly known as the Mann Act. The relevant provisions of the Act in its present form are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whoever knowingly transports in interstate or foreign commerce . . . any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose . . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both." &#167; 2 of the Act of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 825, now 18 U. S. C. &#167; 2421.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facts need not detain us long. Petitioner pleaded guilty to violations laid in two counts, each referring to a different woman. Concededly, the petitioner transported the two women on the same trip and in the same vehicle. This was the basis of his claim that he committed only a single offense and could not be subjected to cumulative punishment under the two counts. The District Court rejected this conception of the statute and sentenced the petitioner to consecutive terms of two years and six months on each of the two counts. On appeal from denial of a motion to correct the sentence, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court. "While the act of transportation was a single one," it ruled, "the unlawful purpose must of necessity have been selective and personal as to each of the women involved. . . . We therefore believe that two separate offenses were committed in this case." 213 F. 2d 629, 630. This decision was in accord with decisions of other lower federal courts, but a contrary holding by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in &lt;i&gt;Robinson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 143 F. 2d 276, raised a square conflict for settlement by this Court. This led us to bring the case here. 348 U. S. 895.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The punishment appropriate for the diverse federal offenses is a matter for the discretion of Congress, subject only to constitutional limitations, more particularly the Eighth Amendment. Congress could no doubt make the simultaneous transportation of more than one woman in &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*83&lt;/span&gt; violation of the Mann Act liable to cumulative punishment for each woman so transported. The question is: did it do so? It has not done so in words in the provisions defining the crime and fixing its punishment. Nor is guiding light afforded by the statute in its entirety or by any controlling gloss. The constitutional basis of the statute is the withdrawal of "the facility of interstate transportation," &lt;i&gt;Hoke&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 227 U. S. 308, 322, though, to be sure, the power was exercised in aid of social morality. Again, it will not promote guiding analysis to indulge in what might be called the color-matching of prior decisions concerned with "the unit of prosecution" in order to determine how near to, or how far from, the problem under this statute the answers are that have been given under other statutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not to be denied that argumentative skill, as was shown at the Bar, could persuasively and not unreasonably reach either of the conflicting constructions. About only one aspect of the problem can one be dogmatic. When Congress has the will it has no difficulty in expressing it&#151;when it has the will, that is, of defining what it desires to make the unit of prosecution and, more particularly, to make each stick in a faggot a single criminal unit. When Congress leaves to the Judiciary the task of imputing to Congress an undeclared will, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity. And this not out of any sentimental consideration, or for want of sympathy with the purpose of Congress in proscribing evil or antisocial conduct. It may fairly be said to be a presupposition of our law to resolve doubts in the enforcement of a penal code against the imposition of a harsher punishment. This in no wise implies that language used in criminal statutes should not be read with the saving grace of common sense with which other enactments, not cast in technical language, are to be read. Nor does it assume that offenders against the law carefully read the penal &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*84&lt;/span&gt; code before they embark on crime. It merely means that if Congress does not fix the punishment for a federal offense clearly and without ambiguity, doubt will be resolved against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses, when we have no more to go on than the present case furnishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE MINTON, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE REED join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statute does not seem ambiguous to me. Congress made it clear enough for me to understand that it was trying to help the States as far as it could to stamp out the degradation and debauchery of women by punishing those who engaged in using them for prostitution. The only way Congress could do that was to make it unlawful to use the channels of commerce to transport them. The statute provides that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whoever knowingly transports in interstate or foreign commerce . . . any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution . . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both." 36 Stat. 825, 18 U. S. C. &#167; 2421.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me the statute means that to transport one or more women or girls in commerce constitutes a separate offense as to each one. Congress had as its purpose the protection of the individual woman or girl from exploitation, and the transportation of each female was to be punished. It was not concerned with protection of the means of transportation. Surely it did not intend to make it easier if one transported females by the bus load. A construction of the statute that reaches that result does violence to its plain wording. That is what the District Court thought, that is what the Court of Appeals thought, and with that I agree, and would affirm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;No. 51.&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Argued November 17-18, 1954.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided March 28, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*438&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;David E. Feller&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Arthur J. Goldberg&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Thomas E. Harris.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mahlon E. Lewis&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Loyal H. Gregg.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE REED, concurring, concluded that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;1. A cause of action for breach of a contract made under the National Labor Relations Act between a union and an employer is a cause of action arising under federal law, and Congress may constitutionally give a federal court jurisdiction over it. Pp. 461-464.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;2. In this case, the claim for wages arises from separate hiring contracts between the employer and each employee, not from the collective bargaining agreement between the employer and the union. Therefore, it does not involve such a violation of a contract between an employer and a union as is required to confer jurisdiction under &#167; 301. Pp. 464-465.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A suit brought by petitioner against respondent under &#167; 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act was dismissed on the merits by the District Court. 107 F. Supp. 692. The Court of Appeals directed a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. 210 F. 2d 623. This Court granted certiorari. 347 U. S. 1010. &lt;i&gt;Affirmed,&lt;/i&gt; p. 461.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*439&lt;/span&gt; MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER announced the judgment of the Court and an opinion in which MR. JUSTICE BURTON and MR. JUSTICE MINTON join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent is a Pennsylvania corporation engaged in the manufacture and sale of electrical equipment in interstate commerce. Petitioner, an unincorporated labor organization and the collective bargaining representative of some 5,000 salaried employees at two of respondent's plants, filed this suit against respondent in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania to enforce collective bargaining agreements then in effect between it and respondent. The suit was brought under &#167; 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 156, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 185, and the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, 62 Stat. 964, as amended, 28 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 2201, 2202.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, petitioner alleged that under the contracts respondent was obligated to pay the employees represented by petitioner their full salary during April 1951, regardless of whether they missed a day's work, unless the absence was due to "furlough" or "leave of absence," and that respondent had violated the contracts by deducting from the pay of some 4,000 of those employees their wages for April 3, when they were absent. No reason was given for their absence, but it was alleged that the reason was not furlough or leave of absence. The employees were not named and were not made parties to the suit. Petitioner requested the court to interpret the contracts, declare the rights of the parties, compel respondent to make an accounting (and name the employees involved and the amounts of unpaid salaries), and enter a judgment against respondent and in favor of the individual employees for the unpaid wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent moved to dismiss the complaint on three grounds: the court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter, petitioner was the wrong party plaintiff under &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*440&lt;/span&gt; Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 17 (a), and the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The district court held that it had jurisdiction over the subject matter and that petitioner was a proper plaintiff but dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim for relief, without prejudice to petitioner's right to amend. It held that, without affirmative averments as to the cause of the absences from work, it must be assumed the absences were voluntary, and that the bargaining contracts did not obligate respondent to pay wages during voluntary absences. 107 F. Supp. 692.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, sitting &lt;i&gt;en banc,&lt;/i&gt; three judges dissenting, vacated the district court's order dismissing the complaint on the merits, and directed a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. After stating that &#167; 301 "is a grant of federal-question jurisdiction and thus creates a federal, substantive right" and reviewing various theories explaining the relationship between union, employer and employees under a collective bargaining agreement, the court adopted an "eclectic theory," based primarily upon language in &lt;i&gt;J. I. Case Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Labor Board,&lt;/i&gt; 321 U. S. 332. The bargaining contract, said the Court, obligates the employer to include in the contracts of hire with each employee the terms and conditions which had been settled between the union and the employer, but the collective contract itself is not a contract of hire. Not until an employee enters into an individual contract of hire and performs services does the employer become bound to pay the particular employee the specified wages. It follows, said the Court, that if there was a breach in this case, it was a breach of the employment contracts with the individual employees who were not paid. Section 301, on the other hand, grants jurisdiction to federal courts only over cases involving breaches of the collective bargaining contract between the union and the employer. Therefore, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*441&lt;/span&gt; it was concluded, the district court was without jurisdiction of the suit. 210 F. 2d 623.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dissenting judges agreed that a failure to pay wages might well constitute a breach of the individual hiring contracts as a basis of common-law suits by the employees. But they deemed the breach, if any, also a breach of the collective bargaining contracts and as such cognizable in the federal court under &#167; 301. They concluded that Rule 17 (a) permitted the union to sue alone, without joinder of the employees, to vindicate the rights of these employees as a class, such employees being beneficiaries of the collective contracts. They agreed with the district court, however, that, on this complaint, the bargaining contracts did not make respondent liable, since the cause of the absences from work was not alleged. 210 F. 2d, at 630.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was brought here for construction of a section of the Taft-Hartley Act which has proved a fertile source of difficulty for the lower courts. 347 U. S. 1010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. In dealing with an enactment such as &#167; 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act,&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; it is necessary first &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*442&lt;/span&gt; to ascertain its jurisdictional scope, more particularly, whether it extends to the suit at hand. Here, as may not infrequently be the case, this question turns in large measure on what sources a federal court would be required to draw upon in determining the underlying substantive rights of the parties&#151;in this case, in deciding whether the union has the contract right which it asserts. If Congress has itself defined the law or authorized the federal courts to fashion the judicial rules governing this question, it would be self-defeating to limit the scope of the power of the federal courts to less than is necessary to accomplish this congressional aim. If, on the other hand, Congress merely furnished a federal forum for enforcing the body of contract law which the States provide, a serious constitutional problem would lie at the threshold of jurisdiction. Moreover, if the function of &#167; 301 is merely that of providing a federal forum for state law, there are good reasons for finding that, despite the broad wording of &#167; 301, Congress did not intend to confer jurisdiction over this type of suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*443&lt;/span&gt; If the section is given the meaning its language spontaneously yields, it would seem clear that all it does is to give procedural directions to the federal courts. "When an unincorporated association that happens to be a labor union appears before you as a litigant in a case involving breach of a collective agreement," Congress in effect told the district judges, "treat it as though it were a natural or corporate legal person and do so regardless of the amount in controversy and do not require diversity of citizenship."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a statute like the Taft-Hartley Act is an organism, &#167; 301 must be placed in the context of the legislation as a whole. So viewed, however, the meaning which the section by itself affords is not affected. While some sections of the Act in certain instances may be relevant in action for breach of contract and as such binding also on the States,&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; no provision suggests general application of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*444&lt;/span&gt; defined or theretofore available federal substantive law in actions arising under &#167; 301.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This examination would conclude the construction of the section by English courts, that is, by any court reading legislation as it is written without drawing on parliamentary debates. And considering that the construction we have found seems plain, the so-called "plain meaning rule," on which construction is from time to time rested also in this Court, likewise makes further inquiry needless and indeed improper. But that rule has not dominated our decisions. The contrary doctrine has prevailed. See &lt;i&gt;Boston Sand &amp;amp; Gravel Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 278 U. S. 41, 48; &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dickerson,&lt;/i&gt; 310 U. S. 554, 561. And so we proceed to an examination of the legislative history to see whether that raises such doubts that the search for meaning should not be limited to the statute itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congressional concern with obstacles surrounding union litigation began to manifest itself as early as 1943. In the first session of the 78th Congress and thereafter numerous bills were introduced proposing various solutions, including federal incorporation,&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; denial of rights under the Wagner Act to contract violators,&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; creation of a cause of action for strikes and other acts in violation of the collective bargaining contract,&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; and grants of federal jurisdiction &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*445&lt;/span&gt; similar to the present &#167; 301.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; Only one of these, the so-called "Case bill," was acted upon. This bill, which passed both Houses in 1946, only to fail through President Truman's veto, included as &#167; 10 a provision somewhat similar to the present section. That section passed the House in the following form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"SEC. 10. BINDING EFFECT OF COLLECTIVE-BARGAINING CONTRACTS.&#151;All collective-bargaining contracts shall be mutually and equally binding and enforceable against each of the parties thereto, any other law to the contrary notwithstanding. In the event of a breach of any such contract or of any agreement contained in such contract by either party thereto, then, in addition to any other remedy or remedies existing, a suit for damages for such breach may be maintained by the other party or parties in any State or United States district court having jurisdiction of the parties." H. R. 4908, 79th Cong., 2d Sess.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussion in that chamber was not enlightening, due perhaps to the fact that the Case bill had been substituted on the House floor for the text of a very different bill and thus had never been considered in committee. Section 10 was presented as necessary to achievement of "mutuality" of obligation between employer and union, but there was no guiding explanation of the nature of the obstacle to mutuality. The language of the section, however, gave support to the view that a federal cause of action was to be created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the bill passed the House, hearings were held on it by the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, during which Senator Taft pointed out to Representative Case that, in his view, the section as written failed to deal &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*446&lt;/span&gt; with the real problem, which was not substantive enforceability but procedural difficulty in obtaining jurisdiction over unincorporated labor organizations. Mr. Case agreed that the section should be redrafted to reach that problem.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; The Committee reported the bill without &#167; 10, asserting that as it passed the House the section was "based upon a misapprehension as to the legal responsibility of the parties under such contracts," that such contracts "are at present legally enforceable in the courts," and that to promote litigation concerning them would be undesirable.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; Senators Ball, Taft and H. Alexander Smith filed a minority report conceding that collective agreements "theoretically are legally enforceable contracts" but contending that action was necessary to overcome practical obstacles to enforcement arising from the status of unions as unincorporated associations. They proposed a differently worded section later adopted in substance by both Houses, which closely approximated the wording of the present &#167; 301.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*447&lt;/span&gt; In introducing this proposed amendment, Senator Taft stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;". . . All we provide in the amendment is that voluntary associations shall in effect be suable as if they were corporations, and suable in the Federal courts if the contract involves interstate commerce and therefore involves a Federal question. . . ." 92 Cong. Rec. 5705.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rather casual &lt;i&gt;non sequitur&lt;/i&gt; seems to suggest reliance not on the existence or establishment of any substantive federal law governing collective bargaining contracts to create a "federal question" in the technical sense relevant to jurisdiction of district courts, but on the mere power of Congress to enact such law.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; While some statements on the Senate floor by opponents of the amendment are ambiguous,&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; all authoritative materials indicate the strictly procedural aim of the section. The aim was to open the federal courts to suits on agreements solely because they were between labor organizations and employers without providing federal law for such suits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first session of the 80th Congress, bills introduced independently in both Houses contained sections strikingly similar to the final version of &#167; 10 of the Case &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*448&lt;/span&gt; bill.&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt; Discussion was more analytical. While generalities in praise of mutuality and enforceability reappear, it was evident that the specific desire was to remove procedural obstacles to suit by and against the union. Senator Pepper and Secretary of Labor Schwellenbach deemed the measure one "to provide a Federal forum" for suits on contracts based on local law.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt; It was assumed that this would result in mutual enforceability, which in turn would further labor harmony. The testimony of Secretary Schwellenbach (who together with the labor unions opposed &#167; 301), minority reports in both Houses,&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; and opposition statements on the floor of the Senate&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt; directed &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*449&lt;/span&gt; attention to the fact that state law would govern actions under &#167; 301 and that this, diversity jurisdiction apart, would raise a substantial constitutional question. No denial of the first of these assertions appears. Senator Taft did not justify &#167; 301 as dependent on federal substantive law governing interpretation of collective bargaining contracts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. President, title III of the bill . . . makes unions suable in the Federal courts for violation of contract. As a matter of law unions, of course, are liable in theory on their contracts today, but as a practical matter it is difficult to sue them. They are not incorporated; they have many members; in some States all the members must be served; it is difficult to know who is to be served. But the pending bill provides they can be sued as if they were corporations and if a judgment is found against the labor organization, even though it is an unincorporated association, the liability is on the labor union and the labor-union funds, and it is not on the individual members of the union, where it has fallen in some famous cases to the great financial distress of the individual members of labor unions." 93 Cong. Rec. 3839.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legislative history, in its relevant aspects, thus reinforces the meaning conveyed by the statute itself as a mere procedural provision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. From this conclusion inevitably emerge questions regarding the constitutionality of a grant of jurisdiction to federal courts over a contract governed entirely by state substantive law, a jurisdiction not based on diversity of citizenship yet one in which a federal court would, as in diversity cases, administer the law of the State in which it sits. The scope of allowable federal judicial power that this grant must satisfy is constitutionally defined as &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*450&lt;/span&gt; "Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority." Art. III, &#167; 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost without exception, decisions under the general statutory grants of jurisdiction strikingly similar to the constitutional wording, have tested jurisdiction in terms of the presence, as an integral part of plaintiff's cause of action, of an issue calling for interpretation or application of federal law.&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt; Although it has sometimes been suggested that the "cause of action" must derive from federal law,&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt; it has been found sufficient that some aspect of federal law is essential to plaintiff's success.&lt;sup&gt;[18]&lt;/sup&gt; The litigation-provoking problem has been the degree to which federal law must be in the forefront of the case and not be remote, collateral or peripheral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has generally been assumed that the full constitutional power has not been exhausted by these general jurisdictional statutes.&lt;sup&gt;[19]&lt;/sup&gt; And in two lines of decision, under special jurisdictional grants for actions by or against federally incorporated organizations&lt;sup&gt;[20]&lt;/sup&gt; and trustees in bankruptcy,&lt;sup&gt;[21]&lt;/sup&gt; federal jurisdiction has been sustained despite the fact that the traditional "federal question" theory of jurisdiction has considerable latitude if satisfied by the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*451&lt;/span&gt; contingent likelihood of presentation of a federal question. Analysis of these cases in terms of that theory reveals analogies to &#167; 301. For federal law is, in certain respects, in the background of any action on a collective bargaining agreement affecting commerce: &#167; 301 vests rights and liabilities, which under state law are distributed among the union members, in a legal "entity" recognized by federal law for purposes of actions on collective bargaining agreements in the federal courts; in such action, the validity of the agreement may be challenged on federal grounds&#151; that the labor organization negotiating it was not the representative of the employees involved, or that subsequent changes in the representative status of the union have affected the continued validity of the agreement.&lt;sup&gt;[22]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal jurisdiction based solely on the fact of federal incorporation has, however, been severely restricted by Congress,&lt;sup&gt;[23]&lt;/sup&gt; and this Court has cast doubt on its continued vitality.&lt;sup&gt;[24]&lt;/sup&gt; Whether the precedent might be extended to meet the substantial difficulties encountered under &#167; 301 would pose a serious constitutional problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognition of jurisdiction in the bankruptcy cases, despite the fact that the actions might be governed solely by state law, draws on the reach of the bankruptcy power, which may reasonably be deemed to sweep within its scope interests sufficiently related to the main purpose of bankruptcy to call for organic treatment. To attempt to reason from these cases to &#167; 301 raises the equally if not more serious question of what, if anything, is encompassed &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*452&lt;/span&gt; in jurisdiction over cases "arising under the laws of the United States" beyond that which traditional "federal question" theory recognizes.&lt;sup&gt;[25]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. In an effort to avoid these problems, lower federal courts have given discordant answers. Most have ascribed to &#167; 301 the creation of "substantive federal rights" or the subjection of collective agreements to a body of federal common law.&lt;sup&gt;[26]&lt;/sup&gt; We must, of course, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*453&lt;/span&gt; defer to the strong presumption&#151;even as to such technical matters as federal jurisdiction&#151;that Congress legislated in accordance with the Constitution. Legislation must, if possible, be given a meaning that will enable it to survive. This rule of constitutional adjudication is normally invoked to narrow what would otherwise be the natural but constitutionally dubious scope of the language. &lt;i&gt;E. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Delaware &amp;amp; Hudson Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 213 U. S. 366; &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rumely,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 41. Here the endeavor of lower courts has resulted in adding to the section substantive congressional regulation even though Congress saw fit not to exercise such power nor to give the courts any concrete guidance for defining such regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the full scope of a substantive regulation is frequently in dispute and must await authoritative determination by courts. Congress declares its purpose imperfectly or partially and the judiciary rounds it out compatibly. But in this case we start with a provision which is wholly jurisdictional and as such bristles with constitutional &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*454&lt;/span&gt; problems under Article III. To avoid them, interpolation of substantive regulation has been proposed. From what materials are we to draw a determination that &#167; 301 is something other than what it clearly appears to be? The problem is particularly vexing in view of the very difficult choice of policy that the alternatives of state or federal law present and the uncertainty as to the consequences of the choice. Is the Court justified in creating all these difficult problems of choice in matters of delicate legislative policy without any direction from Congress and merely for the sake of giving effect to a provision which seems to deal with a different subject? How far are courts to go in reshaping or transforming the obvious design of Congress in order to achieve validity for something Congress has not fashioned? In the words of Mr. Justice Cardozo, speaking for the whole Court: "We think the light is so strong as to flood whatever places in the statute might otherwise be dark. Courts have striven mightily at times to canalize construction along the path of safety . . . . When a statute is reasonably susceptible of two interpretations, they have preferred the meaning that preserves to the meaning that destroys. . . . `But avoidance of a difficulty will not be pressed to the point of disingenuous evasion.' . . . `Here the intention of the Congress is revealed too distinctly to permit us to ignore it because of mere misgivings as to power.' " &lt;i&gt;Hopkins Federal Savings &amp;amp; Loan Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cleary,&lt;/i&gt; 296 U. S. 315, 334-335.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But assuming that we would be justified in proceeding further, the suggestion that the section permits the federal courts to work out without more a federal code governing collective bargaining contracts does not free us from difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a task would involve the federal courts in multiplying problems which could not be solved without disclosing that Congress never intended to raise them. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*455&lt;/span&gt; Application of a body of federal common law would inevitably lead to one of the following incongruities: (1) conflict in federal and state court interpretations of collective bargaining agreements; (2) displacement of state law by federal law in state courts, not only in actions between union and employer but in all actions regarding collective bargaining agreements; or (3) exclusion of state court jurisdiction over these matters. It would also be necessary to work out a federal code governing the interrelationship between the employee's rights and whatever rights were found to exist in the union. Moreover, if the general unfolding of such broad application of federal law were designed, the procedural objectives of Congress would have been accomplished without the need of any special jurisdictional statute. Federal rights would be in issue, and, under 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1331 and Federal Rule 17 (b), the suit could be brought in any district court by or against the union as an entity. The only effect of &#167; 301 would then be to dispense with the requirement of amount in controversy and to adopt certain other minor procedural rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that a more modest role might be assigned to federal law. The suggestion is that, in view of the difficulties which originally plagued the courts called upon to identify the nature of the legal relations created by a collective contract&lt;sup&gt;[27]&lt;/sup&gt; and in view of the generalized &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*456&lt;/span&gt; statements in the legislative history of &#167; 301 in favor of enforceability of collective agreements, &#167; 301 may be viewed as a congressional authorization to the federal courts to work out a concept of the nature of the collective bargaining contract, leaving detailed questions of interpretation to state law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an excessively sophisticated attribution to Congress. Evidence is wholly wanting that Congress was aware of the diverse views taken of the collective bargaining agreement or, in any event, that they were interfering with any federal objective. Moreover, once the right of the union to enter into contracts is granted by state law, these problems are really questions of interpretation of the language of ambiguously drawn contracts. If federal law undertook to resolve these ambiguities, it would become inextricably involved in questions of interpretation of the language of contracts. Discrepancies between federal and state court treatment, while not so inevitable as where federal law undertook the entire task of interpretation, would result. And any difference between state and federal theories of enforceability would present opportunities for forum-shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To turn &#167; 301 into an agency for working out a viable theory of the nature of a collective bargaining agreement smacks of unreality. Nor does it seem reasonable to view that section as a delivery into the discretionary hands of the federal judiciary, finally of this Court, of such an important, complicated and subtle field. These difficulties may be illustrated by a discussion of the holding of the Court of Appeals in the present case. Its "eclectic theory" of the nature of a collective agreement has no support in the statute, and, on the contrary, it is in some ways repugnant to it. (1) For example, the National Labor Relations Act seeks in &#167; 9 (a) to preserve the "right" of an individual employee to take up grievances with his employer; but no one has ever suggested &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*457&lt;/span&gt; that these grievances may not be taken up by the union. (2) It excludes from the court stage the party that is recognized in the required preliminary stages. The union that is empowered to negotiate and settle the controversy before suit is barred from bringing suit when settlement is not reached. (3) This would tend to impair the union's power to negotiate a mutually satisfactory settlement. As a practical matter, the employees expect their union not just to secure a collective agreement but more particularly to procure for the individual employees the benefits promised. If the union can secure only the promise and is impotent to procure for the individual employees the promised benefits, then it is bound to lose their support. And if the union cannot ultimately resort to suit, it is encouraged to resort to strike action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the prime example of an individual cause of action, as distinguished from a union cause, under the Court of Appeals' "eclectic theory," would be the case of the discharge of a single employee. To make the situation vivid, assume that there is no dispute whatever as to the propriety of the alleged ground for the discharge and that the only matter in controversy is the question of fact whether the employee did or did not commit the offense alleged. Yet precisely such incidents often pull the trigger of work stoppages. When stoppages do occur, they most frequently involve a grievance with respect to one employee or a few employees much smaller in number than those involved in the stoppage. That such stoppages are wildcat and officially unauthorized merely emphasizes the fact of group interest in the incident. It is a matter of industrial history that stoppages of work because of disciplinary penalties against individuals, or because of failure to pay the rates claimed, or because of the promotion or layoff of one employee rather than another, or for similar reasons, have been frequent occurrences. A legal rule denying standing to the union to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*458&lt;/span&gt; protect individual rights under what is to be deemed a contract with individuals would encourage such indiscipline. And this is true even though the ultimately desirable social policy is to make it a matter of industrial habit to rely for a remedy for such grievances not on stoppage of work or on lawsuits but on the grievance procedure within an industry. There is in fact a strong group interest in procuring for the employee the benefit promised as well as the promise in the collective agreement. If the union can represent and press that group interest, the stoppage may be avoided; if it cannot, the group resorts to wildcat self-help. The holding below cannot eliminate this group interest; it can stimulate its manifestation by way of a strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the line which the Court of Appeals has drawn the result of interpretation of the particular contract or of a rule of law beyond the power of the parties to alter? If it is the former, then the line can be obliterated by express language in the contract; and the unions can be trusted to find suitable language. They were quick to secure amendment to their constitutions or statutes in order to avoid the decision of this Court in &lt;i&gt;Elgin, Joliet &amp;amp; Eastern R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Burley,&lt;/i&gt; 325 U. S. 711, 327 U. S. 661.&lt;sup&gt;[28]&lt;/sup&gt; If it is the latter, what is the basis for the rule? It is not to be found in fear that the employee &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*459&lt;/span&gt; may not be able to sue. To hold that the union may sue, it is not necessary to hold that the employee may not sue in any forum, and vice versa. At least when the union and the employee are in agreement, there is no reason why either or both should not be permitted to sue. Such is the situation under &#167; 9 (a) of the National Labor Relations Act with respect to the adjustment of grievances without suit. When the employee and the union are in disagreement, the question is not which may sue, but rather the extent to which the one may conclude the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculative reflection reveals other possible substantive additions which might be made to &#167; 301. When tested against the limitations which must restrict judicial elaboration of legislation, however, all meritorious possibilities are either too specialized to reach this case or too insignificant an addition to dissipate the constitutional doubts which have revealed themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. In the present case, however, serious constitutional problems may be avoided, and indeed must be, through the orthodox process of limiting the scope of doubtful legislation. We cannot adopt the reasoning of the Court of Appeals in reaching our conclusion that &#167; 301 does not extend jurisdiction to the present case. That court relied upon an assumed federal concept of the nature of a collective bargaining agreement which is not justified either in terms of discoverable congressional intent or considerations relevant to the function of the collective agreement in the field of labor relations. The same objections do not, however, prevail against the view that whether or not the applicable substantive law&#151;in our view state law&#151; would recognize a right in the union, Congress did not intend to burden the federal courts with suits of this type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the nature of a collective bargaining contract, which involves the correlative rights of employer, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*460&lt;/span&gt; employee &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; union, we might be disposed to read &#167; 301 as allowing the union to sue in this case. With due regard to the constitutional difficulties which would be raised, and in view of the fact that such an interpretation would bring to the federal courts an extensive range of litigation heretofore entertained by the States, we conclude that Congress did not will this result. There was no suggestion that Congress, at a time when its attention was directed to congestion in the federal courts, particularly in the heavy industrial areas, intended to open the doors of the federal courts to a potential flood of grievances based upon an employer's failure to comply with terms of a collective agreement relating to compensation, terms peculiar in the individual benefit which is their subject matter and which, when violated, give a cause of action to the individual employee. The employees have always been able to enforce their individual rights in the state courts.&lt;sup&gt;[29]&lt;/sup&gt; They have not been hampered by the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*461&lt;/span&gt; rules governing unincorporated associations. To this extent, the collective bargaining contract has always been "enforceable."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowhere in the legislative history did Congress discuss or show any recognition of the type of suit involved here, in which the union is suing on behalf of employees for accrued wages. Therefore, we conclude that Congress did not confer on the federal courts jurisdiction over a suit such as this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, with whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK joins, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We agree with the decision but not with all that is said in the opinion. The question we see here is one of statutory interpretation. For us the language of &#167; 301 is not sufficiently explicit nor its legislative history sufficiently clear to indicate that Congress intended to authorize a union to enforce in a federal court the uniquely personal right of an employee for whom it had bargained to receive compensation for services rendered his employer. Thus viewed, it becomes unnecessary for us either to make labor policy or to raise constitutional issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE REED, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My analysis of this case leads me to concur on grounds stated later without the extensive comment and broad treatment given by the opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is there said as to the substantive law to be applied in &#167; 301 actions will be pertinent in cases which are deemed to have been properly brought under that section&#151;that is, where there is set forth the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*462&lt;/span&gt; violation of a collective bargaining agreement based on the failure of either the employer or the union to carry out its undertakings with the other. It is appropriate therefore for me to state my views as to the law which will be applied in those actions and in so doing to express my disagreement with the constitutional doubts raised by the opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the purpose of &#167; 301 was to make unions suable as if corporations, with provisions for venue and service, it also gave jurisdiction to federal district courts over certain matters related to interstate commerce and thus within the legislative powers of Congress. &lt;i&gt;Labor Board Cases,&lt;/i&gt; 301 U. S. 1. The Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, is directed primarily to federal regulation of labor relations affecting commerce through the means of collective bargaining. While all contract questions that may arise in &#167; 301 actions are not covered by the federal statute, the Act furnishes some substantive law which will be applied in those cases. It sets forth guiding principles which will bear on contracts made under it, and it also controls the machinery for reaching those agreements. It points out many things the parties may or may not do in commerce, just as other Acts, such as the Interstate Commerce Act, do. Thus the contracts sued upon in &#167; 301 actions will have been entered into in accordance with federal law; and although federal law does not set forth explicitly just what constitutes a breach, &#167; 301, by granting federal jurisdiction over actions between employers and unions on collective bargaining contracts, does make breaches of them by either of those parties actionable. The fact that unions may make contracts under state law does not bar the Federal Government from legislation in its field. In case of conflict, federal law prevails. It is as true in federal laws as it is in state laws that the power to enact gives power to interpret. &lt;i&gt;Jones&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Prairie Oil Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 273 U. S. 195, at 200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*463&lt;/span&gt; It may be that in proper litigation under &#167; 301 it will be necessary for federal courts to draw largely on state law for the solution of issues. In such instances state law is relied upon because its application is not contrary to federal policy, but supplements and fulfills it. &lt;i&gt;Board of Comm'rs&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 308 U. S. 343, 351. It has been held that a suit in equity on a federal right in a federal court does not necessarily follow a state statute of limitation. &lt;i&gt;Holmberg&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Armbrecht,&lt;/i&gt; 327 U. S. 392. The general rule is that federal interpretation controls a federal act. &lt;i&gt;Jerome&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 318 U. S. 101, 104.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that a considerable amount of state law may be applied in suits under &#167; 301 should not affect the validity of the statute. This Court sustained the jurisdictional grant of &#167; 23 (a) of the Bankruptcy Act, 44 Stat. 664, despite the fact that causes of action brought thereunder were created and governed solely by state law. &lt;i&gt;Schumacher&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Beeler,&lt;/i&gt; 293 U. S. 367; &lt;i&gt;Williams&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Austrian,&lt;/i&gt; 331 U. S. 642. See also &lt;i&gt;Osborn&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bank of the United States,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/rpi/osborn-v-bank-of-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wheat.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;738&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Pacific Railroad Removal cases,&lt;/i&gt; 115 U. S. 1, 11. Cf. the Federal Tort Claims Act. Since Congress has legislative power over labor matters affecting interstate commerce, it may grant jurisdiction to the federal courts to try incidents of that activity that raise legal issues, and dictate what law should be applied. The application of federal law raises no constitutional problem. If state law is to be applied, it is state law operating at the direction of and by the permission of Congress. State law is, in effect, incorporated by reference. Since the contract entered into through provisions of the Labor Act creates rights over which Congress has legislative authority, a breach of the contract is likewise within its power. Congress by &#167; 301 has manifested its purpose to vest jurisdiction over breaches, to a certain extent, in the federal courts. Whether the rules of substantive law applied by the federal courts are derived from federal &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*464&lt;/span&gt; or state sources is immaterial. The rules are truly federal, not state. The cause of action for breach of contract is thus a cause of action arising under federal law, the source of federal judicial power under Art. III of the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the recognition of the power of Congress to regulate matters affecting commerce in &lt;i&gt;Houston &amp;amp; Texas R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; (The Shreveport Doctrine), 234 U. S. 342, 351 (1914), to &lt;i&gt;Labor Board Cases,&lt;/i&gt; 301 U. S. 1 (1937), questions as to the power of Congress over local incidents of national commerce plagued advocates of legal changes with doubts as to the constitutional power of Congress to regulate labor relations effectually. With the full recognition of the integration of the local with the national, the power to use national authority in commerce, when needed, was established. I see no occasion, at this late date, to allow the fog of another day to obscure the national interest in these problems&#151;this time by reason or Article III of the Constitution. Cf. subdivision 2 of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER'S opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason, I think that this union cannot recover from the employer in this suit under &#167; 301 is that the claim for wages for the employees arises from separate hiring contracts between the employer and each employee. The union does not undertake to do work for the employer or even to furnish workers. The duty, if any there be, to pay wages to an employee arises from the individual contract between the employer and employee, not from the collective bargaining agreement. Therefore there is set out no violation of a contract between an employer and a labor organization as is required to confer jurisdiction under &#167; 301. The facts show an alleged violation of a contract between an employer and an employee&#151;a situation that is not covered by the statute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interpretation contained in the preceding paragraph conforms to the words of the section and avoids suggesting &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*465&lt;/span&gt; constitutional limitations that would cripple the creation of a national system for the enforcement of statutes concerning labor relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK concurs, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with MR. JUSTICE REED that Congress in the Taft-Hartley Act created federal sanctions for collective bargaining agreements, made the cases and controversies concerning them justiciable question for the federal courts, and permitted those courts to fashion from the federal statute, from state law, or from other germane sources, federal rules for the construction and interpretation of those collective bargaining agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dissent is from the refusal of the majority to allow the union standing to bring this suit. The complaint alleged that by reason of a collective bargaining agreement the employer was obligated to pay each employee, whom the union represents, his full salary during April 1951, regardless of whether he missed a day's work, unless the employee's absence was due to "furlough" or "leave of absence." The complaint further alleged that the employer had violated the collective bargaining contract by deducting from the pay of some 4,000 employees their wages for April 3 on account of their absence, that absence not being a "furlough" or "leave of absence" within the meaning of the collective bargaining agreement. The union requested a declaration of rights under the collective bargaining agreement. Though the employees affected were not parties to the suit, the complaint prayed for an accounting of the amount owed each employee and a judgment in favor of the individual employees for the unpaid wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make mountains out of molehills in not allowing the union to be the suing as well as the bargaining agency for its members as respects matters involving the construction &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*466&lt;/span&gt; and enforcement of the collective bargaining agreement. Individual contracts of employment result from each collective bargaining agreement. But those contracts are the resultant of the collective bargaining system, a system that continues to function and operate after the contracts are made. The concept of collective bargaining contained in the statute (29 U. S. C. &#167; 159 (a)) includes, of course, the negotiation of the collective agreement and the settling of the term of the individual contracts. But the collective bargaining relationship does not end there. To be sure, the Taft-Hartley Act provides that there shall be no changes in the provisions of the agreement during its term, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 158 (d). But that does not mean that the collective bargaining agent drops out of the picture once the agreement is made. We know enough of trade-union practices to know that the advent of collective bargaining has produced a permanent, organized relationship between the union and the employer, involving a day-to-day administration of the collective agreement. The Act indeed extends the right of collective bargaining that far. For it specifically provides that ". . . to bargain collectively is the performance of the mutual obligation of the employer and the representative of the employees to meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, or the negotiation of an agreement, &lt;i&gt;or any question arising thereunder&lt;/i&gt; . . . ," 61 Stat. 142, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 158 (d) (italics added).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The processing of grievances is recognized by the Act as a function which the labor organization performs or may perform. For 29 U. S. C. &#167; 152 (5) defines "labor organization" as an agency which deals with employers, &lt;i&gt;inter alia,&lt;/i&gt; "concerning grievances." As the National Labor Relations Board stated in &lt;i&gt;Hughes Tool Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 104 N. L. R. B. 318, 326, "The adjustment of grievances, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*467&lt;/span&gt; viewed in the larger aspect, constitutes, to a great degree, the actual administration of a collective-bargaining contract."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administration of the collective agreement is its life and meaning. The adjustment and settlement of grievances, the development of an administrative practice concerning the collective agreement give it force and authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right of individual employees to present their own grievances is recognized by the Act. 29 U. S. C. &#167; 159 (a). But even when they desire to speak for themselves, rather than through the union, Congress attached two important conditions. &lt;i&gt;First,&lt;/i&gt; any adjustment of the individual grievance must not be "inconsistent with the terms of a collective-bargaining contract or agreement then in effect." &lt;i&gt;Second,&lt;/i&gt; the union must be given "opportunity to be present at such adjustment." &lt;i&gt;Id.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is plain, I think, that the grievance procedure is a part of the collective bargaining process. And a lawsuit is one of the ultimates of a grievance. A lawsuit, like negotiation or arbitration, resolves the dispute and settles it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the union represents the interests of the community of employees in the collective bargaining agreement. The wide range of its interests are envisaged by the Act, which gives the collective bargaining agency exclusive authority to bargain "in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment." 29 U. S. C. &#167; 159 (a). The range of its authority is the range of its interests. What the union obtains in the collective agreement it should be entitled to enforce or defend in the forums which have been provided. When we disallow it that standing, we fail to keep the law abreast of the industrial developments of this age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Section 301 provides:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"SEC. 301. (a) Suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this Act, or between any such labor organizations, may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(b) Any labor organization which represents employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this Act and any employer whose activities affect commerce as defined in this Act shall be bound by the acts of its agents. Any such labor organization may sue or be sued as an entity and in behalf of the employees whom it represents in the courts of the United States. Any money judgment against a labor organization in a district court of the United States shall be enforceable only against the organization as an entity and against its assets, and shall not be enforceable against any individual member or his assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(c) For the purposes of actions and proceedings by or against labor organizations in the district courts of the United States, district courts shall be deemed to have jurisdiction of a labor organization (1) in the district in which such organization maintains its principal office, or (2) in any district in which its duly authorized officers or agents are engaged in representing or acting for employee members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(d) The service of summons, subpena, or other legal process of any court of the United States upon an officer or agent of a labor organization, in his capacity as such, shall constitute service upon the labor organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(e) For the purposes of this section, in determining whether any person is acting as an `agent' of another person so as to make such other person responsible for his acts, the question of whether the specific acts performed were actually authorized or subsequently ratified shall not be controlling."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Section 1 of the Act states the congressional aim to be the enumeration of "legitimate rights" of employers and employees and the definition of practices to be outlawed in the interest of furthering industrial peace. No inference pertinent to the jurisdictional content of &#167; 301 can be drawn from this introductory generalization. No other provision of the Act indicates that substantive federal law was to guide the determination of the contractual rights and liabilities that are to flow from a collective bargaining contract. Section 302 contains a highly specialized restriction on the legality of employers' agreements to make payments to employee representatives. Section 303 provides a federal right to recover damages suffered as a result of improper boycotts. Section 8 enumerates unfair labor practices; these may in some instances become relevant to the validity or interpretation of a collective agreement. Certain procedural safeguards are placed about the collective bargaining agreement: an obligation to confer in good faith on questions arising under it; a duty to follow certain steps prior to terminating or modifying the agreement unilaterally. (&#167;&#167; 8 (d), 204 (a) (2).) And a limited number of substantive rights conferred under the Act may incidentally involve the interpretation of the collective agreement. (&lt;i&gt;E. g.,&lt;/i&gt; &#167; 9 (a).) It is significant, however, that breach of contract is not an "unfair labor practice." A proposal to that end was contained in the Senate bill, but was deleted in conference with the observation: "Once parties have made a collective bargaining contract the enforcement of that contract should be left to the usual processes of the law and not to the National Labor Relations Board." (H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 42.) The Act expressly defers to state law on the question of legality of the union shop provision. (&#167;&#167; 8 (a) (3), 14 (b).)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"SEC. &#151;. (a) Suits for violation of a contract concluded as the result of collective bargaining between an employer and a labor organization if such contract affects commerce as defined in this Act may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(b) Any labor organization whose activities affect commerce as defined in this Act shall be bound by the acts of its duly authorized agents acting within the scope of their authority from the said labor organization and may sue or be sued as an entity and in behalf of the employees whom it represents in the courts of the United States: &lt;i&gt;Provided,&lt;/i&gt; That any money judgment against such labor organization shall be enforceable only against the organization as an entity and against its assets, and shall not be enforceable against any individual member or his assets."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[10]  During the hearings on the Taft-Hartley bill, Senator Taft suggested that the fact that the collective bargaining agreement was the product of the exercise of federally created rights and duties was an adequate justification for federal jurisdiction. Hearings before Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, on S. 55 and S. J. Res. 22, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 57.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[11]  See the statements of Senators Murray and Magnuson which seemed to suggest that &#167; 10 would create "Federal rights." 92 Cong. Rec. 5708, 5720, 5411-5415. Senator Murray, however, appears to have been thinking only of the procedural and jurisdictional rights admittedly conferred by &#167; 10. Senator Magnuson spoke before Senator Taft introduced the amendment containing &#167; 10, and may not have understood that it differed considerably from the House version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[13]  Hearings before Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare on S. 55 and S. J. Res. 22, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 58. During these hearings Secretary Schwellenbach stated: "Since the field of necessary legislative action is so narrow, I see no reason why the gates of the Federal courts should be opened so wide as to invite litigation, as is done by this proposed section. Speaking as a lawyer and former member of the Federal judiciary, I have an objection to the abandonment in this field of the requirement of the $3,000 amount in controversy as a prerequisite to Federal jurisdiction. This is a right which has been jealously guarded by the Congress and by the Federal courts. To have them cluttered up with a great mass of petty litigation involving amounts less than $3,000 would bring them back to the position which they occupied during prohibition days when they became just a little bit above the level of the average police court insofar as criminal work was concerned.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I do not see why it is necessary in this filed to abandon the diversity of citizenship requirement. In fact I doubt that it can be abandoned constitutionally. The Constitution, as you know, limits suits in the Federal courts to cases arising under the Constitution and the laws of the United States or involving diversity of citizenship." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 56.&lt;/p&gt;

Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;475&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (state law applied where jurisdiction was based on diversity as well as &#167; 301); &lt;i&gt;Isbrandtsen Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Local 1291,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;107&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;72&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, aff'd 204 F. 2d 495 (diversity again present; on appeal, federal and state law found to be the same and question of applicable law avoided); &lt;i&gt;John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United Office &amp;amp; Professional Workers,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/njd/b77D/john-hancock-mut-life-ins-co-v-united-o-p-wkrs/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;93&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;296&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (removal to federal court denied on ground that even if &#167; 301 gives federal rights, the complaints were framed with reference solely to state law).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most federal courts, however, hold that &#167; 301 created federal substantive rights and, when called upon to choose between state and federal law, apply the latter. &lt;i&gt;E. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United Electrical, Radio &amp;amp; Machine Workers&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Oliver Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 205 F. 2d 376; &lt;i&gt;Milk &amp;amp; Ice Cream Drivers &amp;amp; Dairy Employees Union&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gillespie Milk Products Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 203 F. 2d 650; &lt;i&gt;Shirley-Herman Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;International Hod Carriers Union,&lt;/i&gt; 182 F. 2d 806; &lt;i&gt;International Plainfield Motor Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Local 343,&lt;/i&gt; 123 F. Supp. 683; &lt;i&gt;Waialua Agr. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United Sugar Workers,&lt;/i&gt; 114 F. Supp. 243; &lt;i&gt;Ludlow Mfg.&amp;amp; Sales Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Textile Workers Union,&lt;/i&gt; 108 F. Supp. 45; &lt;i&gt;Pepper &amp;amp; Potter, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Local 977,&lt;/i&gt; 103 F. Supp. 684; &lt;i&gt;Fay&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Cystoscope Makers, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 98 F. Supp. 278; &lt;i&gt;Textile Workers Union&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Aleo Mfg. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 94 F. Supp. 626; &lt;i&gt;Wilson &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United Packing house Workers,&lt;/i&gt; 83 F. Supp. 162; &lt;i&gt;Colonial Hardwood Flooring Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;International Union,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/mdd/cNZi/colonial-hardwood-floor-co-v-international-union/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;76&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;493&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, aff'd 168 F. 2d 33; &lt;i&gt;International Union&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dahlem Const. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 193 F. 2d 470 (semble); see &lt;i&gt;Rock Drilling, Local Union No.17&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mason &amp;amp; Hanger Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 217 F. 2d 687, 691; &lt;i&gt;Schatte&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;International Alliance,&lt;/i&gt; 182 F. 2d 158, 164. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Textile Workers Union&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arista Mills Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 193 F. 2d 529 (refusal to pass on whether substantive federal rights created; federal law apparently viewed as applicable to issue raised in any event).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least two courts have drawn a distinction between the law to be applied to matters of "substantive right" and "remedy." &lt;i&gt;Hamilton Foundry &amp;amp; Machine Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;International Molders Union,&lt;/i&gt; 193 F. 2d 209 (federal rights created but state statute of frauds applied); &lt;i&gt;Textile Workers Union&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Thread Co.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/mad/aLM6/textile-workers-union-v-american-thread-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;113&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;137&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (whether or not federal law applies to other matters, federal law regarding enforcement of arbitration clauses applies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[27]  The collective agreement was variously viewed as : (1) the mere formulation of usage or custom relevant to the interpretation of the individual employment contract; (2) a contract between the employer and the individual member-employees, negotiated by the union as the employee's agent; (3) a contract between the union and employer for the benefit of those individual employees; and (4) as held by the court below, a contract between the union and employer giving the union certain rights, including the right to insist that the employer contract with his employees consistently with the terms of the agreement but giving the union no right to enforce obligations running to individuals under their contract of hire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[28]  The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers amended their Standing Rules to provide for automatic consent of all members to the Brotherhood's prosecution of grievances at their Tenth Triennial Convention in March and April 1947. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen added a similar provision to their Constitution at their 35th Convention in 1947. The Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen amended their "statute" in a similar fashion in 1946. The Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen at their 1946 Convention adopted a new General Rule which empowered the Brotherhood to prosecute grievances "Except in individual cases where the member or members involved serve seasonable written notice on the Brotherhood to the contrary."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[29]  For examples of such suits by employees in state courts prior to 1947, when the Taft-Hartley Act was passed, see &lt;i&gt;Gulla&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Barton,&lt;/i&gt; 164 App. Div. 293, 149 N. Y. Supp. 952; &lt;i&gt;H.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And such suits are still being entertained. &lt;i&gt;E. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dufour&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Continental Southern Lines, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/miss/6LiK/dufour-v-continental-sl-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;219&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Miss.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;296&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 68 So. 2d 489; &lt;i&gt;Donahoo&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Thompson,&lt;/i&gt; 270 S.

&lt;center&gt;No. 184.&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Argued March 2, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided March 28, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;James C. Harkin,&lt;/i&gt; Assistant Attorney General of Oklahoma, argued the cause for appellants in No. 184 and appellees in No. 185. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Mac Q. Williamson,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, &lt;i&gt;Fred Hansen,&lt;/i&gt; First Assistant Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;Leroy Powers. Edmund G. Brown,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General of California, and &lt;i&gt;Eimo G.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*484&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Funke,&lt;/i&gt; Assistant Attorney General, were of counsel on the brief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dick H. Woods&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for appellees in No. 184 and appellants in No. 185. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Duke Duvall&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;John M. Phillips.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Philip B. Perlman&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the American Optometric Association, Inc., as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae,&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal in No. 184 and affirmance in No. 185. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Ellis Lyons&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;William P. MacCracken, Jr.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By special leave of Court, &lt;i&gt;Herbert A. Bergson&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for the Guild of Prescription Opticians of America, Inc. et al., as &lt;i&gt;amici curiae,&lt;/i&gt; urging affirmance in No. 184.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefs of &lt;i&gt;amici curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal in No. 184 and affirmance in No. 185 were filed for the States of Arkansas, by &lt;i&gt;Tom Gentry,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, &lt;i&gt;James L. Sloan,&lt;/i&gt; Assistant Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;Carl Langston;&lt;/i&gt; California, by &lt;i&gt;Edmund G. Brown,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, &lt;i&gt;E. G. Funke,&lt;/i&gt; Assistant Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;Dan Kaufmann,&lt;/i&gt; Deputy Attorney General; Kansas, by &lt;i&gt;Harold R. Fatzer,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;Paul E. Wilson,&lt;/i&gt; First Assistant Attorney General; and Mississippi, by &lt;i&gt;J. P. Coleman,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;Richard A. Billups, Jr.,&lt;/i&gt; Special Assistant Attorney General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suit was instituted in the District Court to have an Oklahoma law (59 Okla. Stat. Ann. &#167;&#167; 941-947, Okla. Laws 1953, c. 13, &#167;&#167; 2-8) declared unconstitutional and to enjoin state officials from enforcing it (28 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 2201, 2202, 2281) for the reason that it allegedly violated various provisions of the Federal Constitution. The matter was heard by a District Court of three judges, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*485&lt;/span&gt; as required by 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2281. That court held certain provisions of the law unconstitutional. 120 F. Supp. 128. The case is here by appeal, 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1253.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Court held unconstitutional portions of three sections of the Act. First, it held invalid under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment the portions of &#167; 2 which make it unlawful for any person not a licensed optometrist or ophthalmologist to fit lenses to a face or to duplicate or replace into frames lenses or other optical appliances, except upon written prescriptive authority of an Oklahoma licensed ophthalmologist or optometrist.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*486&lt;/span&gt; An ophthalmologist is a duly licensed physician who specializes in the care of the eyes. An optometrist examines eyes for refractive error, recognizes (but does not treat) diseases of the eye, and fills prescriptions for eyeglasses. The optician is an artisan qualified to grind lenses, fill prescriptions, and fit frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of &#167; 2 is to forbid the optician from fitting or duplicating lenses without a prescription from an ophthalmologist or optometrist. In practical effect, it means that no optician can fit old glasses into new frames or supply a lens, whether it be a new lens or one to duplicate a lost or broken lens, without a prescription. The District Court conceded that it was in the competence of the police power of a State to regulate the examination of the eyes. But it rebelled at the notion that a State could require a prescription from an optometrist or ophthalmologist "to take old lenses and place them in new frames and then fit the completed spectacles to the &lt;i&gt;face&lt;/i&gt; of the eyeglass wearer." 120 F. Supp., at 135. It held that such a requirement was not "reasonably and rationally related to the health and welfare of the people." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 136. The court found that through mechanical devices and ordinary skills the optician could take a broken lens or a fragment thereof, measure its power, and reduce it to prescriptive terms. The court held that "Although on this precise issue of duplication, the legislature in the instant regulation was dealing with a matter of public interest, the particular means chosen are neither reasonably necessary nor reasonably related to the end sought to be achieved." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 137. It was, accordingly, the opinion of the court that this provision of the law violated the Due Process Clause by arbitrarily interfering with the optician's right to do business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think the due process question is answered in principle by &lt;i&gt;Roschen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ward,&lt;/i&gt; 279 U. S. 337, which upheld a &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*487&lt;/span&gt; New York statute making it unlawful to sell eyeglasses at retail in any store, unless a duly licensed physician or optometrist were in charge and in personal attendance. The Court said, ". . . wherever the requirements of the Act stop, there can be no doubt that the presence and superintendence of the specialist tend to diminish an evil." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 339.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oklahoma law may exact a needless, wasteful requirement in many cases. But it is for the legislature, not the courts, to balance the advantages and disadvantages of the new requirement. It appears that in many cases the optician can easily supply the new frames or new lenses without reference to the old written prescription. It also appears that many written prescriptions contain no directive data in regard to fitting spectacles to the face. But in some cases the directions contained in the prescription are essential, if the glasses are to be fitted so as to correct the particular defects of vision or alleviate the eye condition. The legislature might have concluded that the frequency of occasions when a prescription is necessary was sufficient to justify this regulation of the fitting of eyeglasses. Likewise, when it is necessary to duplicate a lens, a written prescription may or may not be necessary. But the legislature might have concluded that one was needed often enough to require one in every case. Or the legislature may have concluded that eye examinations were so critical, not only for correction of vision but also for detection of latent ailments or diseases, that every change in frames and every duplication of a lens should be accompanied by a prescription from a medical expert. To be sure, the present law does not require a new examination of the eyes every time the frames are changed or the lenses duplicated. For if the old prescription is on file with the optician, he can go ahead and make the new fitting or duplicate the lenses. But the law need not be in every respect logically consistent with its aims &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*488&lt;/span&gt; to be constitutional. It is enough that there is an evil at hand for correction, and that it might be thought that the particular legislative measure was a rational way to correct it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day is gone when this Court uses the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to strike down state laws, regulatory of business and industrial conditions, because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought. See &lt;i&gt;Nebbia&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York,&lt;/i&gt; 291 U. S. 502; &lt;i&gt;West Coast Hotel Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Parrish,&lt;/i&gt; 300 U. S. 379; &lt;i&gt;Olsen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Nebraska,&lt;/i&gt; 313 U. S. 236; &lt;i&gt;Lincoln Union&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Northwestern Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 335 U. S. 525; &lt;i&gt;Daniel&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Family Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 336 U. S. 220; &lt;i&gt;Day-Brite Lighting, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Missouri,&lt;/i&gt; 342 U. S. 421. We emphasize again what Chief Justice Waite said in &lt;i&gt;Munn&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Illinois,&lt;/i&gt; 94 U. S. 113, 134, "For protection against abuses by legislatures the people must resort to the polls, not to the courts."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the District Court held that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to subject opticians to this regulatory system and to exempt, as &#167; 3 of the Act&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; does, all sellers of ready-to-wear glasses. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*489&lt;/span&gt; The problem of legislative classification is a perennial one, admitting of no doctrinaire definition. Evils in the same field may be of different dimensions and proportions, requiring different remedies. Or so the legislature may think. &lt;i&gt;Tigner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Texas,&lt;/i&gt; 310 U. S. 141. Or the reform may take one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind. &lt;i&gt;Semler&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dental Examiners,&lt;/i&gt; 294 U. S. 608. The legislature may select one phase of one field and apply a remedy there, neglecting the others. &lt;i&gt;A. F. of L.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Sash Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 335 U. S. 338. The prohibition of the Equal Protection Clause goes no further than the invidious discrimination. We cannot say that that point has been reached here. For all this record shows, the ready-to-wear branch of this business may not loom large in Oklahoma or may present problems of regulation distinct from the other branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, the District Court held unconstitutional, as violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, that portion of &#167; 3 which makes it unlawful "to solicit the sale of . . . frames, mountings . . . or any other optical appliances."&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; The court conceded that state regulation of advertising relating to eye examinations was a matter "rationally related to the public health and welfare" (120 F. Supp., at 140) and therefore subject to regulation within the principles of &lt;i&gt;Semler&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dental Examiners, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; But regulation of the advertising of eyeglass frames was said to intrude "into a mercantile field only casually related to the visual care of the public" &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*490&lt;/span&gt; and restrict "an activity which in no way can detrimentally affect the people." 120 F. Supp., at 140-141.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An eyeglass frame, considered in isolation, is only a piece of merchandise. But an eyeglass frame is not used in isolation, as Judge Murrah said in dissent below; it is used with lenses; and lenses, pertaining as they do to the human eye, enter the field of health. Therefore, the legislature might conclude that to regulate one effectively it would have to regulate the other. Or it might conclude that both the sellers of frames and the sellers of lenses were in a business where advertising should be limited or even abolished in the public interest. &lt;i&gt;Semler&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dental Examiners, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; The advertiser of frames may be using his ads to bring in customers who will buy lenses. If the advertisement of lenses is to be abolished or controlled, the advertising of frames must come under the same restraints; or so the legislature might think. We see no constitutional reason why a State may not treat all who deal with the human eye as members of a profession who should use no merchandising methods for obtaining customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the District Court held unconstitutional, as violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the provision of &#167; 4 of the Oklahoma Act which reads as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"No person, firm, or corporation engaged in the business of retailing merchandise to the general public &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*491&lt;/span&gt; shall rent space, sublease departments, or otherwise permit any person purporting to do eye examination or visual care to occupy space in such retail store."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to us that this regulation is on the same constitutional footing as the denial to corporations of the right to practice dentistry. &lt;i&gt;Semler&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dental Examiners, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 611. It is an attempt to free the profession, to as great an extent as possible, from all taints of commercialism. It certainly might be easy for an optometrist with space in a retail store to be merely a front for the retail establishment. In any case, the opportunity for that nexus may be too great for safety, if the eye doctor is allowed inside the retail store. Moreover, it may be deemed important to effective regulation that the eye doctor be restricted to geographical locations that reduce the temptations of commercialism. Geographical location may be an important consideration in a legislative program which aims to raise the treatment of the human eye to a strictly professional level. We cannot say that the regulation has no rational relation to that objective and therefore is beyond constitutional bounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we have said is sufficient to dispose of the appeal in No. 185 from the conclusion of the District Court that that portion of &#167; 3 which makes it unlawful to solicit the sale of spectacles, eyeglasses, lenses, and prisms by the use of advertising media is constitutional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other contentions urged by appellants in No. 185 are without merit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed in part and reversed in part.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1]  Section 2 reads as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, corporation, company, or partnership not licensed under the provisions of Chapter 11 or Chapter 13 of Title 59, Oklahoma Statutes 1951, to fit, adjust, adapt, or to in any manner apply lenses, frames, prisms, or any other optical appliances to the face of a person, or to duplicate or attempt to duplicate, or to place or replace into the frames, any lenses or other optical appliances which have been prescribed, fitted, or adjusted for visual correction, or which are intended to aid human vision or to give any treatment or training designed to aid human vision, or to represent or hold himself out to the public as being qualified to do any of the acts listed in this Section, except that persons licensed under the provisions of Chapters 11 or 13 of Title 59, Oklahoma Statutes 1951 may in a written prescription, or its duplicate, authorize any optical supplier to interpret such prescription, and who in accordance therewith may measure, adapt, fit, prepare, dispense, or adjust such lenses, spectacles, eye glasses, prisms, tinted lenses, frames or appurtenances thereto, to the human face for the aid or correction of visual or ocular anomalies of the human eye; and may continue to do the said acts on the aforesaid written prescription, or its duplicate, provided, however, that the physician or optometrist writing such prescription shall remain responsible for the full effect of the appliances so furnished by such other person. Provided that this Section shall not prevent a qualified person from making repairs to eye glasses."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 11, Title 59, Okla. Stat. 1951, provides for the licensing of ophthalmologists and other doctors. Chapter 13 provides for the certification of optometrists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Section 3 reads as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, company, corporation or partnership to solicit the sale of spectacles, eye glasses, lenses, frames, mountings, prisms or any other optical appliances or devices, eye examinations or visual services, by radio, window display, television, telephone directory display advertisement, or by any other means of advertisement; or to use any other method or means of baiting, persuading, or enticing the public into buying spectacles, eye glasses, lenses, frames, mounting, prisms, or other optical appliances for visual correction. Provided, however, that the provisions of this Act shall not render any newspaper or other advertising media liable for publishing any advertising furnished them by a vendor of said commodity or material; nor shall anything in this Act prevent ethical education publicity or advertising by legally qualified health groups that does not violate presently existing laws of Oklahoma, nor prevent the proper use of ethical, professional notices. Nothing in this Act shall prohibit the sale of ready-to-wear glasses equipped with convex-spherical lenses nor sunglasses equipped with plano lenses nor industrial glasses and goggles with plano lenses used for industrial eye protection when sold as merchandise at any established places of business and where the selection of the glasses is at the discretion of the purchaser."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  See note 2, &lt;i&gt;supra.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  The court also said:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Advertising directed exclusively at this feature of eye wear can have no deleterious effect on the public, inasmuch as it has no influence on the &lt;i&gt;prospective&lt;/i&gt; wearer of eyeglasses, and to the &lt;i&gt;present&lt;/i&gt; wearer (a person already examined by a licensed professional) is but a mere piece of merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The dispensing optician, a merchant in this particular, cannot arbitrarily be divested of a substantial portion of his business upon the pretext that such a deprivation is rationally related to the public health." 120 F. Supp., at 142.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;No. 199.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued February 28, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided March 28, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Assistant Attorney General Holland, Charles F. Barber, Ellis N. Slack&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Melva M. Graney.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*427&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Max Swiren&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the Glenshaw Glass Company, respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Sidney B. Gambill&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Joseph D. Block.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Samuel H. Levy&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for William Goldman Theatres, Inc., respondent. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Bernard Wolfman.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This litigation involves two cases with independent factual backgrounds yet presenting the identical issue. The two cases were consolidated for argument before the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and were heard &lt;i&gt;en banc.&lt;/i&gt; The common question is whether money received as exemplary damages for fraud or as the punitive two-thirds portion of a treble-damage antitrust recovery must be reported by a taxpayer as gross income under &#167; 22 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; In a single opinion, 211 F. 2d 928, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Tax Court's separate rulings in favor of the taxpayers. 18 T. C. 860; 19 T. C. 637. Because of the frequent recurrence of the question and differing interpretations by the lower courts of this Court's decisions bearing upon the problem, we granted the Commissioner of Internal Revenue's ensuing petition for certiorari. 348 U. S. 813.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facts of the cases were largely stipulated and are not in dispute. So far as pertinent they are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Commissioner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Glenshaw Glass Co.&lt;/i&gt;&#151;The Glenshaw Glass Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, manufactures glass bottles and containers. It was engaged in protracted litigation with the Hartford-Empire Company, which manufactures machinery of a character used by Glenshaw. Among the claims advanced by Glenshaw &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*428&lt;/span&gt; were demands for exemplary damages for fraud&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; and treble damages for injury to its business by reason of Hartford's violation of the federal antitrust laws.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; In December, 1947, the parties concluded a settlement of all pending litigation, by which Hartford paid Glenshaw approximately $800,000. Through a method of allocation which was approved by the Tax Court, 18 T. C. 860, 870-872, and which is no longer in issue, it was ultimately determined that, of the total settlement, $324,529.94 represented payment of punitive damages for fraud and antitrust violations. Glenshaw did not report this portion of the settlement as income for the tax year involved. The Commissioner determined a deficiency claiming as taxable the entire sum less only deductible legal fees. As previously noted, the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals upheld the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Commissioner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;William Goldman Theatres, Inc.&lt;/i&gt;&#151; William Goldman Theatres, Inc., a Delaware corporation operating motion picture houses in Pennsylvania, sued Loew's, Inc., alleging a violation of the federal antitrust laws and seeking treble damages. After a holding that a violation had occurred, &lt;i&gt;William Goldman Theatres, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Loew's, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 150 F. 2d 738, the case was remanded to the trial court for a determination of damages. It was found that Goldman had suffered a loss of profits equal to $125,000 and was entitled to treble damages in the sum of $375,000. &lt;i&gt;William Goldman Theatres, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Loew's, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/paed/cBAo/william-goldman-theatres-v-loews-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;69&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;103&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, aff'd, 164 F. 2d 1021, cert. denied, 334 U. S. 811. Goldman reported only $125,000 of the recovery as gross income and claimed that the $250,000 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*429&lt;/span&gt; balance constituted punitive damages and as such was not taxable. The Tax Court agreed, 19 T. C. 637, and the Court of Appeals, hearing this with the &lt;i&gt;Glenshaw&lt;/i&gt; case, affirmed. 211 F. 2d 928.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is conceded by the respondents that there is no constitutional barrier to the imposition of a tax on punitive damages. Our question is one of statutory construction: are these payments comprehended by &#167; 22 (a)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sweeping scope of the controverted statute is readily apparent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"SEC. 22. GROSS INCOME.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(a) GENERAL DEFINITION.&#151;`Gross income' includes gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service . . . of whatever kind and in whatever form paid, or from professions, vocations, trades, businesses, commerce, or sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal, growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such property; also from interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, &lt;i&gt;or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever.&lt;/i&gt; . . ." (Emphasis added.)&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Court has frequently stated that this language was used by Congress to exert in this field "the full measure of its taxing power." &lt;i&gt;Helvering&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Clifford,&lt;/i&gt; 309 U. S. 331, 334; &lt;i&gt;Helvering&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Midland Mutual Life Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 300 U. S. 216, 223; &lt;i&gt;Douglas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Willcuts,&lt;/i&gt; 296 U. S. 1, 9; &lt;i&gt;Irwin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gavit,&lt;/i&gt; 268 U. S. 161, 166. Respondents contend that punitive damages, characterized as "windfalls" flowing from the culpable conduct of third parties, are not within the scope of the section. But Congress applied no limitations as to the source of taxable receipts, nor restrictive &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*430&lt;/span&gt; labels as to their nature. And the Court has given a liberal construction to this broad phraseology in recognition of the intention of Congress to tax all gains except those specifically exempted. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jacobson,&lt;/i&gt; 336 U. S. 28, 49; &lt;i&gt;Helvering&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Stockholms Enskilda Bank,&lt;/i&gt; 293 U. S. 84, 87-91. Thus, the fortuitous gain accruing to a lessor by reason of the forfeiture of a lessee's improvements on the rented property was taxed in &lt;i&gt;Helvering&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bruun,&lt;/i&gt; 309 U. S. 461. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Robertson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 343 U. S. 711; &lt;i&gt;Rutkin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 343 U. S. 130; &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kirby Lumber Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 284 U. S. 1. Such decisions demonstrate that we cannot but ascribe content to the catchall provision of &#167; 22 (a), "gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever." The importance of that phrase has been too frequently recognized since its first appearance in the Revenue Act of 1913&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; to say now that it adds nothing to the meaning of "gross income."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor can we accept respondent's contention that a narrower reading of &#167; 22 (a) is required by the Court's characterization of income in &lt;i&gt;Eisner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Macomber,&lt;/i&gt; 252 U. S. 189, 207, as "the gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined."&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; The Court was there endeavoring to determine whether the distribution of a corporate stock dividend constituted a realized gain to the shareholder, or changed "only the form, not the essence," of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*431&lt;/span&gt; his capital investment. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 210. It was held that the taxpayer had "received nothing out of the company's assets for his separate use and benefit." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 211. The distribution, therefore, was held not a taxable event. In that context&#151;distinguishing gain from capital&#151;the definition served a useful purpose. But it was not meant to provide a touchstone to all future gross income questions. &lt;i&gt;Helvering&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bruun, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 468-469; &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kirby Lumber Co., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have instances of undeniable accessions to wealth, clearly realized, and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion. The mere fact that the payments were extracted from the wrongdoers as punishment for unlawful conduct cannot detract from their character as taxable income to the recipients. Respondents concede, as they must, that the recoveries are taxable to the extent that they compensate for damages actually incurred. It would be an anomaly that could not be justified in the absence of clear congressional intent to say that a recovery for actual damages is taxable but not the additional amount extracted as punishment for the same conduct which caused the injury. And we find no such evidence of intent to exempt these payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is urged that re-enactment of &#167; 22 (a) without change since the Board of Tax Appeals held punitive damages nontaxable in &lt;i&gt;Highland Farms Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 42 B. T. A. 1314, indicates congressional satisfaction with that holding. Re-enactment&#151;particularly without the slightest affirmative indication that Congress ever had the &lt;i&gt;Highland Farms&lt;/i&gt; decision before it&#151;is an unreliable indicium at best. &lt;i&gt;Helvering&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wilshire Oil Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 308 U. S. 90, 100-101; &lt;i&gt;Koshland&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Helvering,&lt;/i&gt; 298 U. S. 441, 447. Moreover, the Commissioner promptly published his nonacquiescence in this portion of the &lt;i&gt;Highland Farms&lt;/i&gt; holding&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; and has, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*432&lt;/span&gt; before and since, consistently maintained the position that these receipts are taxable.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; It therefore cannot be said with certitude that Congress intended to carve an exception out of &#167; 22 (a)'s pervasive coverage. Nor does the 1954 Code's&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; legislative history, with its reiteration of the proposition that statutory gross income is "all-inclusive,"&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; give support to respondent's position. The definition of gross income has been simplified, but no effect upon its present broad scope was intended.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; Certainly punitive damages cannot reasonably be classified as gifts, cf. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jacobson,&lt;/i&gt; 336 U. S. 28, 47-52, nor do they come under any other exemption provision in the Code. We would do violence to the plain meaning of the statute and restrict a clear legislative attempt to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*433&lt;/span&gt; bring the taxing power to bear upon all receipts constitutionally taxable were we to say that the payments in question here are not gross income. See &lt;i&gt;Helvering&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Midland Mutual Life Ins. Co., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 223.&lt;/p&gt;

Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 247 U. S. 179, 185, two cases construing the Revenue Act of 1909, 36 Stat. 11, 112. Both taxpayers were "wasting asset" corporations, one being engaged in mining, the other in lumbering operations. The definition was applied by the Court to demonstrate a distinction between a return on capital and "a mere conversion of capital assets." &lt;i&gt;Doyle&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mitchell Bros. Co., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 184. The question raised by the instant case is clearly distinguishable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[8]  The long history of departmental rulings holding personal injury recoveries nontaxable on the theory that they roughly correspond to a return of capital cannot support exemption of punitive damages following injury to property. See 2 Cum. Bull. 71; I-1 Cum. Bull. 92, 93; VII-2 Cum. Bull. 123; 1954-1 Cum. Bull. 179, 180. Damages for personal injury are by definition compensatory only. Punitive damages, on the other hand, cannot be considered a restoration of capital for taxation purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This section corresponds to section 22 (a) of the 1939 Code. While the language in existing section 22 (a) has been simplified, the all-inclusive nature of statutory gross income has not been affected thereby. Section 61 (a) is as broad in scope as section 22 (a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Section 61 (a) provides that gross income includes `all income from whatever source derived.' This definition is based upon the 16th Amendment and the word `income' is used in its constitutional sense." H. R. Rep. No. 1337, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; note 10, at A18.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided May 9, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
ON PETITION FOR REHEARING.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Neil R. McCluhan&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lowell C. Kindig&lt;/i&gt; for petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*71&lt;/span&gt; MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an action for damages brought by plaintiff, petitioner here, in the District Court of Woodbury County, Iowa, to compensate her for mental suffering claimed to flow from defendant cemetery's refusal to bury her husband, a Winnebago Indian, after services had been conducted at the grave site and the burial party had disbanded. Plaintiff founded her action, so far as here relevant, on breach of a contract whereby defendant had undertaken to afford plaintiff "Right of Sepulture" in a specified lot of its cemetery. The contract of sale of the burial lot also provided that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"burial privileges accrue only to members of the Caucasian race."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiff asserted that this provision was void under both the Iowa and the United States Constitutions and that recognition of its validity would violate the Fourteenth Amendment. By an amendment to the complaint, plaintiff also claimed a violation of the United Nations Charter. The defense was anchored in the validity of the clause as a bar to this action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an abortive attempt to remove the case to the federal courts, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/iand/8611/rice-v-sioux-city-memorial-park-cemetery/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;102&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;658&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, defendants moved to dismiss the amended petition in the state court. This motion was denied, except that insofar as the amendment to the petition had relied on the United Nations Charter, the amendment was dismissed. Following Iowa procedure, the trial court entertained motions by both parties requesting it to adjudicate prior to trial points of law relating to the effect of the restrictive covenant. The Iowa court ruled that the clause was not void but was unenforceable as a violation of the Constitutions and public policy of Iowa and the United States. Nevertheless, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*72&lt;/span&gt; it held that the clause "may be relied upon as a defense" and that "the action of a State or Federal Court in permitting a defendant to stand upon the terms of its contract and to defend this action in court would not constitute state or federal action" contrary to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. It again ruled that the United Nations Charter was irrelevant, and the case was finally dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court of Iowa affirmed, reasoning that the decision of this Court in &lt;i&gt;Shelley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kraemer,&lt;/i&gt; 334 U. S. 1, when considered in conjunction with the &lt;i&gt;Civil Rights Cases,&lt;/i&gt; 109 U. S. 3, did not require a state court to ignore such a provision in a contract when raised as a defense and in effect to reform the contract by enforcing it without regard to the clause. The court further ruled that the provisions of the United Nations Charter "have no bearing on the case" and that none of the grounds based on local law sustained the action. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;245&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Iowa&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;147&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 60 N. W. 2d 110. We granted certiorari, 347 U. S. 942.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basis for petitioner's resort to this Court was primarily the Fourteenth Amendment, through the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. Only if a State deprives any person or denies him enforcement of a right guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment can its protection be invoked. Such a claim involves the threshold problem whether, in the circumstances of this case, what Iowa, through its courts, did amounted to "state action." This is a complicated problem which for long has divided opinion in this Court. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Raymond&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chicago Traction Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 207 U. S. 20; &lt;i&gt;Snowden&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hughes,&lt;/i&gt; 321 U. S. 1; &lt;i&gt;Terry&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Adams,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 461. See also, &lt;i&gt;Barrows&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jackson,&lt;/i&gt; 346 U. S. 249. Were this hurdle cleared, the ultimate substantive question, whether in the circumstances of this case the action complained of was condemned by the Fourteenth Amendment, would in turn present no easy constitutional problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*73&lt;/span&gt; The case was argued here and the stark fact is that the Court was evenly divided. 348 U. S. 880. In accordance with undeviating practice, no indication was given regarding the grounds of this division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the familiar though vexing problems of constitutional law, there was reference in the opinions of the Iowa courts and in the briefs of counsel to the United Nations Charter. The Iowa courts dismissed summarily the claim that some of the general and hortatory language of this Treaty, which so far as the United States is concerned is itself an exercise of the treaty-making power under the Constitution, constituted a limitation on the rights of the States and of persons otherwise reserved to them under the Constitution. It is a redundancy to add that there is, of course, no basis for any inference that the division of this Court reflected any diversity of opinion on this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following our affirmance by necessity of the decision of the Iowa Supreme Court, a petition was filed for a rehearing before a full Court. In our consideration of this petition our attention has now been focused upon an Iowa statute enacted since the commencement of this litigation. Though it was in existence at the time the case first came here, it was then not seen in proper focus because blanketed by the issues of "state action" and constitutional power for which our interest was enlisted. This Iowa statute bars the ultimate question presented in this case from again arising in that State. In light of this fact and the standards governing the exercise of our discretionary power of review upon writ of certiorari, we have considered anew whether this case is one in which "there are special and important reasons" for granting the writ of certiorari, as required by Supreme Court Rule 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Rule, formulated thirty years ago, embodies the criteria, developed ever since the Evarts Act of 1891, by which the Court determines whether a particular case &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*74&lt;/span&gt; merits consideration, with due regard to the proper functioning of the limited reviewing power to which this Court is confined, decisively restricted through the creation of the intermediate Courts of Appeals and more largely confined by the Judiciary Act of 1925. In illustrating the character of reasons which may be deemed "special and important," the Rule refers to cases&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Where a state court has decided a federal question of substance not theretofore determined by this court, or has decided it in a way probably not in accord with applicable decisions of this court."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal question raised by a petitioner may be "of substance" in the sense that, abstractly considered, it may present an intellectually interesting and solid problem. But this Court does not sit to satisfy a scholarly interest in such issues. Nor does it sit for the benefit of the particular litigants. (&lt;i&gt;Magnum Import Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Coty,&lt;/i&gt; 262 U. S. 159, 163; see also Address of Mr. Chief Justice Vinson, before the American Bar Association, Sept. 7, 1949, 69 Sup. Ct. v, vi; Address of Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, before the American Law Institute, May 10, 1934, XI Proc. Am. Law Inst. 313.) "Special and important reasons" imply a reach to a problem beyond the academic or the episodic. This is especially true where the issues involved reach constitutional dimensions, for then there comes into play regard for the Court's duty to avoid decision of constitutional issues unless avoidance becomes evasion. Cf. the classic rules for such avoidance stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis in &lt;i&gt;Ashwander&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tennessee Valley Authority,&lt;/i&gt; 297 U. S. 288, 341.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present case, certiorari was granted, according to our practice, because at least four members of the Court deemed that despite the rather unique circumstances of this case Iowa's willingness to enforce this restrictive covenant rendered it "special and important." &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*75&lt;/span&gt; We were unmindful at the time of Iowa's corrective legislation and of its implications. While that statute had been cited in the opinion of the Iowa Supreme Court, without quotation, in tangential support of a substantive argument, and while similar passing references appear in respondent's briefs in opposition to the petition and on the merits, it was not even suggested as a ground for opposing the grant. Its importance was not put in identifying perspective, and it did not emerge to significance in the sifting process through which the annual hundreds of petitions for certiorari pass. Argument at the Bar was concerned with other issues and the even division of the Court forestalled that intensive study attendant upon opinion-writing which might well have revealed the crucial relevance of the statute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These oversights should not now be compounded by further disregard of the impact of this enactment when viewed in the light of settled Iowa law, not previously brought to our attention, concerning its effect upon private litigation. The statute provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"SECTION 1. Any corporation or other form of organization organized or engaging in the business under the laws of the state of Iowa, or wheresoever organized and engaging in the business in the state of Iowa, of the ownership, maintenance or operation of a cemetery . . . except . . . churches or religious or established fraternal societies, or incorporated cities or towns or other political subdivisions of the state of Iowa . . . shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;.....&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"SEC. 8. It shall be unlawful for any organization subject to the provisions of this chapter to deny the privilege of interment of the remains of any deceased person in any cemetery . . . solely because &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*76&lt;/span&gt; of the race or color of such deceased person. Any contract, agreement, deed, covenant, restriction or charter provision at any time entered into, or by-law, rule or regulation adopted or put in force, either subsequent or prior to the effective date of this chapter, authorizing, permitting or requiring any organization subject to the provisions of this chapter to deny such privilege of interment because of race or color of such deceased person is hereby declared to be null and void and in conflict with the public policy of this state. . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"SEC. 9. Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of this chapter, shall, upon conviction, be punishable by a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;.....&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"SEC. 12. Nothing in this Act contained shall affect the rights of any parties to any pending litigation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;.....&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Approved April 21, 1953." Iowa Laws 1953, c. 84; Iowa Code Ann. (1954 Cum. Supp.) &#167; 566A. 1-11.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this Act, in any other case arising under similar circumstances not only would the statutory penalties be applicable, but also, under Iowa law, one in petitioner's position would be entitled to recover damages in a civil action based on a violation of the statute. See &lt;i&gt;Humburd&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Crawford,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;128&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Iowa&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;743&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 105 N. W. 330; &lt;i&gt;Brown&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;J. H. Bell Co.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;146&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Iowa&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;89&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 123 N. W. 231, 124 N. W. 901; &lt;i&gt;Amos&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Prom, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/iand/8ouv/amos-v-prom-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;117&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;615&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (D. C. N. D. Iowa).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had the statute been properly brought to our attention and the case thereby put into proper focus, the case would have assumed such an isolated significance that it would &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*77&lt;/span&gt; hardly have been brought here in the first instance.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Any adjudication of the constitutional claims pressed by petitioner would now be an adjudication under circumstances not promotive of the very social considerations which evidently inspired the Iowa Legislature to provide against the kind of discrimination of which complaint is here made. On the one hand, we should hesitate to pass judgment on Iowa for unconstitutional action, were such to be found, when it has already rectified any possible error. On the other hand, we should not unnecessarily discourage such remedial action by possible condonation of this isolated incident. Moreover, the evident difficulties of the case suggest that, in the absence of compelling reason, we should not risk inconclusive and divisive disposition of a case when time may further illumine or completely outmode the issues in dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such factors are among the many which must be weighed in the exercise of that "sound judicial discretion" which Rule 19 requires. We have taken this opportunity to explain their relevance, when normally, for obvious reasons in view of our volume of business, no opinion accompanies dismissal of a writ as improvidently granted, because of the apt illustration here provided of the kinds of considerations, beyond those listed by Rule 19 as illustrative but not exhaustive, which preclude adjudication on the merits of cases which may have the surface appearance of public importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are therefore of the opinion that this Court's order of November 15, 1954, affirming by an equally divided Court the decision of the Iowa Supreme Court, must be vacated and the writ of certiorari dismissed as improvidently granted. There is nothing unique about such &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*78&lt;/span&gt; dismissal even after full argument. There have been more than sixty such cases and on occasion full opinions have accompanied the dismissal.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; The circumstances of this case may be different and more unusual. But this &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*79&lt;/span&gt; impressive practice proves that the Court has not hesitated to dismiss a writ even at this advanced stage where it appears on further deliberation, induced by new considerations, that the case is not appropriate for adjudication. In the words of Mr. Chief Justice Taft, speaking for a unanimous Court:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If it be suggested that as much effort and time as we have given to the consideration of the alleged conflict would have enabled us to dispose of the case before us on the merits, the answer is that it is very important that we be consistent in not granting the writ of certiorari except in cases involving principles the settlement of which is of importance to the public as distinguished from that of the parties, and in cases where there is a real and embarrassing conflict of opinion and authority between the circuit courts of appeal." &lt;i&gt;Layne &amp;amp; Bowler Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Western Well Works, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 261 U. S. 387, 393.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petition for rehearing is granted. The order of this Court of November 15, 1954, affirming by necessity the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*80&lt;/span&gt; judgment of the Supreme Court of Iowa is vacated and the writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think that only very unusual circumstances can justify dismissal of cases on the ground that certiorari was improvidently granted. Our objections to such dismissals are stronger when, as here, a case has already been argued and decided by the Court. We do not agree that the circumstances relied on by the Court justify this dismissal. We granted certiorari because serious questions were raised concerning a denial of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Those questions remain undecided. The Court dismisses the case because the Iowa Legislature has provided that every person in Iowa except one who has already filed a suit can prosecute claims like this. Apparently this law leaves everyone in Iowa free to vindicate this kind of right except the petitioner. This raises a new question of denial of equal protection of the laws equally as grave as those which prompted us to take this case originally. We cannot agree that this dismissal is justified merely because this petitioner is the only one whose rights may have been unconstitutionally denied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only in the light of argument on the merits did it become clear in these numerous cases that the petitions for certiorari should not have been granted. In some instances an asserted conflict turned out to be illusory; in others, a federal question was wanting or decision could be rested on a non-federal ground; in a number, it became manifest that the question was of importance merely to the litigants and did not present an issue of immediate public significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Argued February 28, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided May 16, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eberhard P. Deutsch&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Rene H. Himel, Jr.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ralph S. Spritzer&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Burger&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Samuel D. Slade.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Selim B. Lemle&lt;/i&gt; filed a brief for the American Barge Line, Inc. et al., as &lt;i&gt;amici curiae,&lt;/i&gt; urging affirmance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question presented is whether a towboat may validly contract against all liability for its own negligent towage. Since there is no controlling statute the question must be decided as a part of the judicially created admiralty law. Federal courts have disagreed as to whether &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*86&lt;/span&gt; there is or should be a judicial rule invalidating such contracts. Calling attention to this uncertainty, the District Court, sitting in admiralty, sustained a contractual provision exempting respondent towboat owner from liability for negligence and entered judgment accordingly. 114 F. Supp. 713. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 211 F. 2d 401. We granted certiorari to settle the question. 348 U. S. 811.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The record including the findings of fact shows: Petitioner's oil barge &lt;i&gt;Bisso&lt;/i&gt; while being towed up the Mississippi River by the respondent's steam towboat &lt;i&gt;Cairo&lt;/i&gt; collided with a bridge pier and sank. At the time, the barge had no motive power, steering apparatus, officers or crew, its movements being completely controlled by the &lt;i&gt;Cairo.&lt;/i&gt; Negligent towage by those operating the &lt;i&gt;Cairo&lt;/i&gt; caused the collision. Consequently, respondent, owner of the &lt;i&gt;Cairo,&lt;/i&gt; would have been required to pay petitioner damages unless relieved of liability by certain clauses in the towage contract. One provides that the towing movement should be at the "sole risk" of the barge, and a second provides that masters, crews and employees of the towboat &lt;i&gt;Cairo&lt;/i&gt; should "in the performance of said service, become and be the servants" of the barge &lt;i&gt;Bisso.&lt;/i&gt; The Court of Appeals construed both these clauses as relieving respondent from liability for its negligence and held both valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A release-from-liability clause in a towage contract was first considered by this Court in 1871 in &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;167&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. There negligent towage by the &lt;i&gt;Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; damaged a canal-boat being towed. To escape liability owners of the towboat relied on a contractual agreement that "the canal-boat was being towed at her own risk." Notwithstanding the agreement, this Court held that the towboat "must be visited with the consequences" of its negligence.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; For many years &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*87&lt;/span&gt; seems to have been generally accepted as either (1) construing a contract to "tow at own risk" as not including an exemption from negligence, or (2) holding invalid as against public policy a contract which exempts a tower from his negligence.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1909 &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; was repudiated by the Second Circuit in &lt;i&gt;The Oceanica,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;170&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;893&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. That court construed a contract requiring a towed vessel to "assume all risks" as exempting the tower from responsibility for its negligence; it also held, over strong dissent, that the contract was not invalid as against public policy. And on rehearing the court conceded that "the decision of the majority of the court as to the right of a tug to contract against her own negligence is a departure from previous decisions." The court went on to express hope that the question would "be set at rest in this case by the Supreme Court." Certiorari was denied,&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; however, and courts in the Second Circuit continued to follow the newly announced &lt;i&gt;Oceanica&lt;/i&gt; doctrine.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; But other circuits continued &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*88&lt;/span&gt; to refuse to allow towboats by contract to escape liability for their negligent towage.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in that state of intercircuit conflict that this Court again, in 1928, considered the effect of a contract claimed to exempt a towboat from its negligence. &lt;i&gt;The Wash Gray,&lt;/i&gt; 277 U. S. 66.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; The contract involved provided that the towboat should not be "responsible in any way for loss or damage" to the &lt;i&gt;Wash Gray,&lt;/i&gt; the vessel being towed. This Court was urged to follow &lt;i&gt;The Oceanica.&lt;/i&gt; But counsel for the &lt;i&gt;Wash Gray,&lt;/i&gt; relying on &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse,&lt;/i&gt; insisted that recovery for "actionable negligence is not barred by release in contract for towage."&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; Without mention of &lt;i&gt;The Oceanica&lt;/i&gt; this Court said: "We do not think that the towing contract has the effect claimed for it by the companies. It did not release the [towboat] . . . from any loss or damage to the `Wash Gray' due to the negligence of the master or crew of the towing vessel . . . . The rule laid down by this Court in &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; . . . covers the point." 277 U. S., at 73. The contracts in &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Wash Gray&lt;/i&gt; were worded quite differently, and there is little indication that the "rule" the Court had in mind was one of mere contractual interpretation. Rather a public policy objection to such contracts was indicated by the Court's quoting from that part of &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*89&lt;/span&gt; opinion which pointed out that despite the contract there the towboat had to bear the consequences of its negligence even though the law had not imposed on it the obligations resting on a common carrier.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is nevertheless argued that &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Wash Gray&lt;/i&gt; did not announce a rule of public policy against release-from-negligence contracts but decided no more than what the towage contracts in those cases meant. Strong arguments can be made in support of this contention but we think stronger arguments can be made against it. &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; was decided in an era of manifest judicial hostility toward release-from-negligence contracts, particularly those made by businesses dealing widely with the public and having potential monopolistic powers.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; That hostility caused this Court two years later to declare that public policy forbade common carriers to make such contracts.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; The next year telegraph company contracts were brought under the same ban although the Court stated they were not common carriers.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; Largely because of this general judicial attitude and the influence of &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; no towage release-from-negligence clause appears to have been enforced by any court for 38 years. During that period and later enforcement was refused in two ways&#151;either by giving &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*90&lt;/span&gt; such contracts a very narrow construction or by holding them to be against public policy. One court even expressly declared it to be "contrary to public policy to so construe" a contract that a tower could be allowed to go clear of all liability for his own negligence.&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt; When the Second Circuit belatedly departed from &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; other courts still refused to enforce towers' stipulations against their negligence. And when this Court was urged in &lt;i&gt;The Wash Gray&lt;/i&gt; to repudiate &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; by following &lt;i&gt;The Oceanica&lt;/i&gt; the answer was an emphatic reiteration and approval of the language and holding of &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse.&lt;/i&gt; Viewed in light of this history, we think &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse, The Wash Gray&lt;/i&gt; and intervening lower court cases together strongly point to the existence of a judicial rule, based on public policy, invalidating contracts releasing towers from all liability for their negligence.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt; Because of this judicial history and cogent reasons in support of a rule outlawing such contracts we now, despite past uncertainty and difference among the circuits, accept this as the controlling rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rule is merely a particular application to the towage business of a general rule long used by courts and legislatures to prevent enforcement of release-from-negligence contracts in many relationships such as bailors and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*91&lt;/span&gt; bailees,&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; employers and employees,&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt; public service companies and their customers.&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt; The two main reasons for the creation and application of the rule have been (1) to discourage negligence by making wrongdoers pay damages, and (2) to protect those in need of goods or services from being overreached by others who have power to drive hard bargains.&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt; These two reasons are no less applicable today than when &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Wash Gray&lt;/i&gt; were decided. And both reasons apply with equal force whether tugs operate as common carriers or contract carriers.&lt;sup&gt;[18]&lt;/sup&gt; The dangers of modern machines make it all the more necessary that negligence be discouraged. And increased maritime traffic of today makes it not less but more important that vessels in American ports be able to obtain towage free of monopolistic compulsions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical result of leaving towers wholly free to contract against all liability for their negligence is strikingly illustrated in an English case. The Port of London &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*92&lt;/span&gt; controlled and operated all tugs in the harbor and by law no ship could enter without the aid of Port Authority tugs. But no shipowner could get a Port tug unless he first signed a contract agreeing to be liable for all damages caused by the negligence of the tug's employees. Under such a contract the court allowed the Port Authority to recover damages from a ship towed for injuries to the Port's tug caused by negligence of the Port's employees running the tug.&lt;sup&gt;[19]&lt;/sup&gt; Such a result would be impossible under the rule we accept as controlling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is contended that the towage contract rule we have accepted was rejected by this Court in &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dalzell Towing Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 287 U. S. 291.&lt;sup&gt;[20]&lt;/sup&gt; We disagree. Unlike &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse, The Wash Gray&lt;/i&gt; and the instant case, &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil&lt;/i&gt; did not involve a contract designed to relieve a towboat owner from liability for negligent towage. The contractual clause there involved related only to pilotage. The clause provided that a tug captain who piloted a vessel propelled on its own power should be considered the servant of that vessel and that the tug owners should &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*93&lt;/span&gt; not be liable for his negligent pilotage.&lt;sup&gt;[21]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sun Oil&lt;/i&gt; construed this contract as relieving the tugboat owners from all liability for negligence of the tug captain while piloting Sun Oil's vessel and held the contract valid as thus construed. But both the Court of Appeals&lt;sup&gt;[22]&lt;/sup&gt; and this Court recognized that holding the pilotage contract valid did not conflict with &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;The Wash Gray.&lt;/i&gt; Indeed, this Court expressly stated that the &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil&lt;/i&gt; decree was "not in conflict with the decisions" in &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Wash Gray.&lt;/i&gt; It is of course possible that the Court found an absence of conflict in the cases because of a different construction given the different contracts involved. We doubt this, but however this may be there are more basic differences upon which we prefer to rest this Court's statement that &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil&lt;/i&gt; did not conflict with the two prior cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are distinctions between a pilotage and a towage exemption clause which make it entirely reasonable to hold one valid and the other invalid. A pilotage clause exempts for the negligence of pilots only; a towage clause exempts from all negligence of all towage employees. Pilots hold a unique position in the maritime world and have been regulated extensively both by the States and Federal Government.&lt;sup&gt;[23]&lt;/sup&gt; Some state laws make them public &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*94&lt;/span&gt; officers, chiefly responsible to the State, not to any private employer. Under law and custom they have an independence wholly incompatible with the general obligations of obedience normally owed by an employee to his employer.&lt;sup&gt;[24]&lt;/sup&gt; Their fees are fixed by law and their charges must not be discriminatory. As a rule no employer, no person, can tell them how to perform their pilotage duties. When the law does not prescribe their duties, pilots are usually free to act on their own best judgment while engaged in piloting a vessel. Because of these differences between pilots and towage employees generally, contracts stipulating against a pilot's negligence cannot be likened to contracts stipulating against towers' negligence. It is one thing to permit a company to exempt itself from liability for the negligence of a licensed pilot navigating another company's vessel on that vessel's own power. That was the &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil&lt;/i&gt; case. It is quite a different thing, however, to permit a towing company to exempt itself by contract from all liability for its own employees' negligent towage of a vessel. Thus, holding the pilotage contract valid in the &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil&lt;/i&gt; case in no way conflicts with the rule against permitting towers by contract wholly to escape liability for their own negligent towing. That rule renders invalid the first provision of the contract in this case that the towing had to be done at the sole risk of the towed vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second clause in the contract&#151;that the employees of the towboat &lt;i&gt;Cairo&lt;/i&gt; should be servants of the barge &lt;i&gt;Bisso&lt;/i&gt;&#151;likewise cannot be enforced. For if valid, the only effect of that clause would be to shift all liability for negligent towage from the towboat to the vessel being towed, precisely what the first clause attempted to do. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*95&lt;/span&gt; This is true because employees of a towboat do not become employees of a vessel being towed just because a contract says so, when as here the workers are in truth and in fact solely employees of the towboat.&lt;sup&gt;[25]&lt;/sup&gt; This towboat belonged to respondent. It was manned by workers hired and paid by respondent. They remained at all times subject to respondent's complete control. In contrast, the owners of the barge being towed never had any relationship of any kind or character with those who controlled and operated the towboat. The rule against contractual exemption of a towboat from responsibility for its own negligence cannot be defeated by the simple expedient of providing in a contract that all employees of a towboat shall be employees of the towed vessel when the latter "employment" is purely a fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I join in the opinion of the Court. I do not think we know enough about the economics and organization of this business&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; to change the established rule of &lt;i&gt;The Steamer&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*96&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Syracuse,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;167&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 171, and &lt;i&gt;The Wash Gray,&lt;/i&gt; 277 U. S. 66, 73, that a tug may not contract against her own negligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with the Court that &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dalzell Towing Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 287 U. S. 291, was not a departure from that rule. In that case the vessel which was being assisted by the tugs was under her own power and was manned by her own crew. The negligence was that of a tug captain on board the vessel under tow. The Court enforced the contract, which made his negligence the negligence of the vessel, under the familiar rule that "when one puts his employee at the disposal and under the direction of another for the performance of service for the latter, such employee while so engaged acts directly for and is to be deemed the employee of the latter and not of the former." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 295.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil&lt;/i&gt; case, the tug was not a common carrier or a contract carrier. It was merely assisting a vessel under her own power. Here we are dealing with dead tows, where the tug and the tug alone is in control, where the tows are without power and without crews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that situation, the tugboats are common carriers&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; when they so hold themselves out (&lt;i&gt;Stimson Lumber Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kuykendall,&lt;/i&gt; 275 U. S. 207; &lt;i&gt;Cornell Steamboat Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 321 U. S. 634) or contract carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far as we know, the tugboats in the present cases are as much common carriers as the tugboats in the &lt;i&gt;Cornell Steamboat&lt;/i&gt; case and the &lt;i&gt;Stimson Lumber Co.&lt;/i&gt; case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common carriers may not "by any form of agreement secure exemption from liability for loss or damage caused &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*97&lt;/span&gt; by their own negligence." &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dalzell Towing Co., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 294. See &lt;i&gt;Railroad Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lockwood,&lt;/i&gt; 17 Wall. 357; &lt;i&gt;Liverpool Steam Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Phenix Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 129 U. S. 397. The reasons are as germane to a tugboat that is a contract carrier as they are to a tugboat that is a common carrier. They were well stated by Judge Coxe, dissenting in &lt;i&gt;The Oceanica,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;170&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;893&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 896:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It ought to be against public policy to permit a vessel to contract against her own fault. To allow her to do so begets recklessness, carelessness and neglect. The same reasons for prohibiting such a contract in the case of common carriers apply, though not, perhaps, to the same extent, in the case of a towage contract. In both cases the design is to prevent those who have the absolute control of another's property from extorting an agreement that they may neglect all reasonable precautions to preserve it."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the tug is only a contract carrier, it is not liable for injury to the tow in the absence of negligence. See &lt;i&gt;Stevens&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;The White City,&lt;/i&gt; 285 U. S. 195. But though a contract carrier, the tug may as effectively command the market and have as complete control of the tow and cargo as any common carrier. The reasons stated by Judge Coxe seem, therefore, as germane to the contract carrier as to the common carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be that the rule of &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; is outmoded and should be changed. It may be that the tugboat industry is less able to carry the risks of those losses than its customers. It may be fairer in the long run to let the tugboat operator free himself from his own negligence and transfer the liability to the shippers who employ his services. But the very statement of the problem raises large questions of policy on which the present records throw no light. We would have to know much more about the economics and organization of the tugboat &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*98&lt;/span&gt; industry than we are offered here to fashion a new rule.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Accordingly, I would continue to enforce the established rule of &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; that has its roots deep in history and experience, until and unless Congress adopts another one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE REED and MR. JUSTICE BURTON join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on its constitutional powers in matters maritime (Art. III, &#167; 2), this Court has probably made as much substantive admiralty law through adjudication as has Congress by legislation. Indeed, not a little of legislation has displaced or modified the Court's decisions. This creative judicial function of making admiralty law remains unimpaired, so that it is within the Court's jurisdiction now to announce, as new doctrine, that tow and tug may not by agreement relieve the tug of liability for damage to the tow caused by the tug's negligence. Of course, the Court should not restrict the area of full bargaining between tow and tug unless an overriding public interest calls for such restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Court does not now profess to originate a doctrine of invalidity of such an agreement. Pervading the Court's opinion is the assumption that it is merely making explicit what has been the presupposition and direction, if not the unequivocal pronouncement, of the controlling body of decisions. These decisions, we are told, "strongly point to the existence of a judicial rule, based on public policy, invalidating contracts releasing towers from all liability for their negligence." On this &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*99&lt;/span&gt; assumption, one easily slides to the Court's conclusion. Such an assumption almost implies the conclusion, for a long-established rule, not remotely related to any constitutional question and readily amenable to legislative change, should be adhered to. Especially in the domain of commercial affairs, &lt;i&gt;stare decisis&lt;/i&gt; has a strong social justification. In conducting their affairs, men naturally assume that courts will not unsettle a settled rule for the conduct of business, certainly not unless experience has made manifest the need for overturning the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assert that a rule has been established by courts necessarily implies authoritative pronouncement of a doctrine, its application to litigation, and its continuing vitality. Such a rule ought to be found in adjudications in this Court or at the very least&#151;in the case of maritime matters&#151;in the weight of authority in lower courts, particularly in the Southern District of New York where admiralty law has to such a large extent developed. The claimed rule cannot avouch the decisions in this Court nor the body of lower court decisions. In their entirety, the decisions reflect the opposite. A critical examination of them yields these conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) In &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;167&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, this Court did not have before it any claim of exemption from all negligence such as is presented here. &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; therefore could not have decided, and it did not purport to decide, the validity of such an exemption. &lt;i&gt;The Wash Gray,&lt;/i&gt; 277 U. S. 66, purports to be no more than a decision on a question of construction, in which &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; was cited as precedent for placing a narrow construction on exculpatory clauses.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(2) The Circuits other than the Ninth do not disclose decisions that towboats cannot by contract &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*100&lt;/span&gt; escape liability for negligent towage. In the Ninth there is talk, not decision.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(3) In respecting an agreement for exemption in the case of a private carrier, we do not disregard any decision of this Court or any persuasive body of authority in the Courts of Appeals. On the other hand, to recognize the validity of such a provision accords with the decisions and pronouncements of the two Circuits having the most active admiralty business, and with the underlying considerations of policy upon which this Court very recently and unanimously enforced a similar provision for exemption in &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dalzell Towing Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 287 U. S. 291.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The materials on which these conclusions are based are not esoteric. They are to be assessed, of course, according to time-honored rules for reading cases&#151;that cases hold only what they decide, not what slipshod or ignorant headnote writers state them to decide; that decisions are one thing, gratuitous remarks another. A stew may be a delicious dish. But a stew is not to be made in law by throwing together indiscriminately decision and dicta, cases involving common carriers and private carriers, cases involving monopolistic or otherwise patently unequal bargaining power and cases arising under contracts between parties bargaining at arm's length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential in examining these cases to differentiate sharply between construction and validity. Since negligence is the ordinary basis for liability, relief from it should be clearly agreed upon between the parties and ambiguity should not leave the extent of such relief in doubt. Accordingly, provisions for exemption are closely scrutinized by courts and doubts either as to the existence of the provision of exemption or its scope are resolved against relief from responsibility. It is fair to say that a number of the cases relied upon for support against the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*101&lt;/span&gt; validity of an exemption are cases in which the existence of such a provision was not established or its meaning was appropriately given limited scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These conclusions require documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DECISIONS OF THIS COURT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. In &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;167&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the crucial issue in the District Court, on appeal in the Circuit Court, and on appeal here, was whether or not on the particular facts of that case the steamer &lt;i&gt;Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; had been "navigated with ordinary care and skill."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; had been engaged in towing canalboats through New York harbor. The tug's owners had given the owners of the tow a receipt stating that the service was to be performed "at the risk of her owners." In a libel based on the tug's negligence in permitting the tow to strike an anchored vessel and be sunk, the District Court held that, while the parties were free to vary their responsibilities by contract, the words of the receipt&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; "did not operate to relieve or discharge the steamboat and her owners from the exercise of all reasonable skill." &lt;i&gt;Langley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse,&lt;/i&gt; 14 Fed. Cas. 1115, No. 8,068. This decision was affirmed both by the Circuit Court, &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse,&lt;/i&gt; 23 Fed. Cas. 593, No. 13,717, and this Court with no suggestion that the controlling issue was other than that on which the District Court had based its decision. Neither in the answer to the libel, nor in the proceedings &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*102&lt;/span&gt; in the District Court, nor in those in the Circuit Court, including the opinion of Mr. Justice Nelson, sitting as Circuit Justice, nor in the briefs in this Court, nor in the opinion here, was there ever tendered the issue which is tendered in this case&#151;namely, the enforceability of an agreement whereby a private carrier is relieved from liability for negligence. Nor was there any pronouncement on such an issue. Throughout the litigation there is not the faintest suggestion that the receipt raised any issue other than whether the &lt;i&gt;Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; was or was not "navigated with ordinary care and skill" in the very special circumstances of the particular seamanship. It would seem indeed strange that the brief of E. C. Benedict, probably the leading admiralty lawyer of his day, should not give a hint of reliance on a clause exempting from liability for negligence, but instead bring all its argumentation to bear to prove that the duty to navigate "with ordinary care and skill" was satisfied. He thus framed his only contention regarding the effect of the contract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The boat was towed under a contract on the part of the libellant that he would bear the risks of the navigation, provided, the steamboat which furnished the propulsive power, was navigated with ordinary care and skill.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This we submit is the fair intent of the contract to tow the boat `at the risk of her masters and owners.' " Brief for Appellant, p. 3; see 12 Wall., at 170 (summary of argument).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language of both Mr. Justice Nelson, in the Circuit Court, and Mr. Justice Davis, for this Court, must be read in the light of the issues that were framed in the District Court, the course of evidence in that court, the contentions of the parties and the explicitness of the briefs &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*103&lt;/span&gt; in this Court. The claim was not relief from liability for negligence but that the admitted duty of "ordinary care and skill" in navigation had not been satisfied. There is no suggestion, either in this Court's opinion or that of Mr. Justice Nelson on circuit, that a rule of public policy was being announced barring agreements, fairly entered into, relieving private carriers from liability. &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; was decided here in 1871. It was not until 1873 that such agreements were invalidated in the case of common carriers. &lt;i&gt;Railroad Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lockwood,&lt;/i&gt; 17 Wall. 357. And not until 18 years later was this rule applied to common carriers by water. &lt;i&gt;Liverpool &amp;amp; Great Western Steam Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Phenix Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 129 U. S. 397. Surely this Court did not impliedly, in a moment of absent-mindedness, declare such a rule in the case of a private carrier and two years later require 25 pages to justify it in the case of common carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliance upon any climate of "manifest judicial hostility toward release-from-negligence contracts" existing at this time is singularly misplaced. In this period American legal thought placed entirely too high a value upon liberty of contract. See Pound, Liberty of Contract, 18 Yale L. J. 454. Had there been such an attitude, it could not have been a factor in a case in which both parties agreed that no such contract was involved. Moreover, this hostility, insofar as it was more than a mode of narrowly construing contracts designed to cut down common-law liability, was limited to situations where inequality of bargaining power in relation to essential services called for judicial intervention. Compare &lt;i&gt;Railroad Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lockwood, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;Baltimore &amp;amp; Ohio S. R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Voigt,&lt;/i&gt; 176 U. S. 498; &lt;i&gt;Santa Fe, P. &amp;amp; P. R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Grant Bros. Const. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 228 U. S. 177.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The superficial ambiguity of the language of the Court's opinion in &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse,&lt;/i&gt; when read &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*104&lt;/span&gt; without reference to the issues before it, led some lower courts to speculate as to its meaning. But &lt;i&gt;Compania de Navigacion La Flecha&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Brauer,&lt;/i&gt; 168 U. S. 104, left no ground for such confusion. The &lt;i&gt;Brauer&lt;/i&gt; case involved a contract for carriage of cattle on the deck of a steamer "at owner's risk, steamer not to be held accountable for accident to, or mortality of, the animals, from whatever cause arising." The contract specified that it was to be interpreted according to English law. A libel against the shipowner was brought for the loss of the cattle which, during a storm at sea, had been unnecessarily driven overboard by the crew. The Court, noting a conflict between American and English decisions regarding the right of a &lt;i&gt;common&lt;/i&gt; carrier to relieve itself of the consequences of negligence, found it unnecessary to determine which of these rules was applicable, stating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"By the laws of both countries, . . . an exception, in the bill of lading, of perils of the sea, or other specified perils, does not . . . exempt him from liability for loss or damage from one of those perils, to which the negligence of himself or his servants has contributed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This rule of construction was fully established in this court before it had occasion to decide the question whether it was within the power of the carrier by express stipulation to exempt himself from all responsibility for the negligence of himself or his servants.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the leading case of &lt;i&gt;New Jersey Steam Navigation Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Merchants' Bank,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;How.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;344&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . . . . [the Court stated] `But we think it would be going farther than the intent of the parties . . . were we to regard it as stipulating for . . . want of ordinary care . . . .' `If it is competent at all for the carrier to stipulate. . . it should be required to be done, at least, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*105&lt;/span&gt; in terms that would leave no doubt as to the meaning of the parties.' &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;How.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;383&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 384. See also . . . &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;167&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;." 168 U. S., at 118-120.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This citation of &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; as an example of instances in which a rule of narrow construction of exculpatory clauses had been invoked should have set to rest any misunderstanding concerning the scope of its ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;i&gt;Compania de Navegacion Interior, S. A.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fireman's Fund Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 277 U. S. 66 (&lt;i&gt;The Wash Gray),&lt;/i&gt; was a consolidation of libels by the owner of the &lt;i&gt;Wash Gray,&lt;/i&gt; lost while in tow on the Gulf of Mexico, against eleven insurance companies which had underwritten the voyage. One of the defenses of the insurers was that the contract of towage had contained, unknown to them, the following provision which they alleged to have been material to the risk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Freeport Sulphur No. 1 [the tug] will furnish hawser. All other risk and expense to be borne by [the Wash Gray]. It is understood you will keep sufficient men on board to keep up steam and man the tug's pumps. S. S. Freeport No. 1 is not responsible in any way for loss or damage to the Wash Gray."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Court had held that the towage clause "does not pretend to release liability for loss or damage growing out of the tower's negligence. Such an intention would be defeated by the very obscurity of its terms." 14 F. 2d 196, 200. The Court of Appeals reversal rested on grounds not here relevant. 19 F. 2d 493.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On writ of certiorari, this Court, reversing the Court of Appeals, dismissed the contention of the insurers in the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We do not think that the towing contract has the effect claimed for it by the companies. It did not release the `Freeport' from any loss or damage to the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*106&lt;/span&gt; `Wash Gray' due to the negligence of the master or crew of the towing vessel; and for a loss thus caused the companies would be subrogated to the claim of the owner of the `Wash Gray.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The rule laid down by this Court in &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;167&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 171, covers the point. . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In view of this state of the law, the towing contract here shown was not a fact material to the risk, a concealment of which from the underwriters would injure them or avoid the policy." 277 U. S., at 73-74.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wording of the clause differed, to be sure, from that involved in &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse.&lt;/i&gt; But the language relied upon by the insurers, in the context of the rest of the clause and the undertaking involved, was no more suggestive of an attempt to avoid liability for negligence than that construed in &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse.&lt;/i&gt; It is hardly surprising that the Court applied, at the instance of the party to the contract, the narrower meaning which the parties in &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; had conceded to be proper, and rejected the insurer's attempt to escape liability by attributing the broadest meaning to the clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Any support for the present decision drawn from the language of &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Wash Gray&lt;/i&gt; is decisively repelled by the decision in &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dalzell Towing Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 287 U. S. 291. That case involved the following clause of a contract for assistance of a tanker to its berth at Bergen, New Jersey:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When the captain of any tug engaged in the services of towing a vessel . . . goes on board said vessel, it is understood and agreed that said tugboat captain becomes the servant of the owners in respect to the giving of orders to any of the tugs engaged in the towage service and in respect to the handling of such vessel, and neither the tugs nor their owners or agents shall be liable for any damage resulting therefrom."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*107&lt;/span&gt; While the captain of one of respondent's tugs was acting as pilot on board the tanker, it went aground and was damaged. In the resulting action against the tug, this Court upheld the validity of the clause, stating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The validity of its applicable provision cannot reasonably be doubted. So far as concerns the service to be rendered under the agreement, respondent was not a common carrier or bailee or bound to serve or liable as such. Towage does not involve bailment, and the services covered by the contract were less than towage. . . . There is no foundation in this case for the application of the doctrine that common carriers and others under like duty to serve the public according to their capacity and the terms of their undertaking cannot by any form of agreement secure exemption from liability for loss or damage caused by their own negligence. . . . Respondent had no exclusive privilege or monopoly in respect of the services that petitioner desired to have performed for its tanker. And petitioner was under no compulsion to accept the terms of respondent's pilotage clause. There is nothing to suggest that the parties were not on equal footing or that they did not deal at arm's length. `There is no rule of public policy which denies effect to their expressed intention, but on the contrary, as the matter lies within the range of permissible agreement, the highest public policy is found in the enforcement of the contract which was actually made.' . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Respondent's responsibility is not to be extended beyond the service that it undertook to perform. It did not furnish pilotage. . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The decree under consideration is not in conflict with the decisions of this court cited by petitioner, &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;167&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Compania de Navegacion&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 277 U. S. 66. Neither &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*108&lt;/span&gt; involved an agreement similar to the provisions of the pilotage clause on which this case turns." 287 U. S., at 294-295.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opinion distinguishes &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Wash Gray&lt;/i&gt; not on the ground that there is an essential difference between considerations of policy applicable to towage and pilotage, but expressly and only on the ground that the provisions of the contracts differed, thus viewing the earlier cases as involving no more than matters of construction. Of course there are differences between the situation before the Court in &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil&lt;/i&gt; and the one now before us. But the analysis which led the Court to its conclusion there is equally applicable here and calls for upholding the validity of this agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DECISIONS IN THE LOWER COURTS.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Concededly, the Second Circuit has, ever since the decision in &lt;i&gt;The Oceanica,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;170&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;893&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1909),&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; upheld the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*109&lt;/span&gt; validity of agreements whereby towers avoid liability for their own negligence. Its most recent reiteration of this position is found in &lt;i&gt;Nielson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 209 F. 2d 958, today reversed on other grounds, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 129. To the Second Circuit there must now be added the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and Fifth Circuits by virtue of their decisions in this case and in &lt;i&gt;Boston Metals Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;The Winding Gulf&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; It is not without significance that the Second and Fifth Circuits are first and second in volume of admiralty litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. In a series of three cases, the Sixth Circuit has assiduously avoided the issue of validity of exculpatory clauses, resting instead upon construction of the clause in issue as not reaching the negligence involved. &lt;i&gt;Great Lakes Towing Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bethlehem Transp. Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 65 F. 2d 543;&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*110&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Great Lakes Towing Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American S. S. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 165 F. 2d 368;&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Walter G. Hougland, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Muscovalley,&lt;/i&gt; 184 F. 2d 530.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The Ninth Circuit is the only Circuit which has indicated &#151;but not decided&#151;that it might differ with the Second, Fourth and Fifth Circuit Courts of Appeals were it forced to pass squarely on the issue of validity. The statement in the syllabus to the first of the relevant cases in the Ninth Circuit, &lt;i&gt;Alaska Commercial Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Williams,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;128&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;362&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, is inaccurate. While it says that a tug "cannot relieve itself by contract from liability for the failure to exercise reasonable care and skill," the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*111&lt;/span&gt; court concluded that the lower court had properly excluded an amendment to the pleadings and testimony which, it was alleged, was designed to show the existence of an exculpatory clause. It then merely added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"But we are of the opinion that if the plaintiff in error had proved the contract to be as in the proposed amendment it was alleged to be, it would not have afforded it exemption from liability in the present case," citing &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse.&lt;/i&gt; 128 F., at 366.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mylroie&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;British Columbia Tug Co.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/vHS/british-columbia-mills-tug-barge-co-v-mylroie/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;268&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;449&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, involved a contract of towage which stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"That the Tug will render to the said Barge `Bangor' reasonable assistance from time to time in any emergency which might arise. . . . The Tug Company is not to be held liable for any damage which might happen to the said barge `Bangor' or its cargo while in tow or at anchor."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The barge had been lost after a sudden change of course by the tug, made without warning to the barge, caused the towline to snap. The Court of Appeals was ready to hold, and appeared to view the &lt;i&gt;Alaska Commercial&lt;/i&gt; case as holding, that the tower could not, for reasons of public policy, avoid liability for negligence. Such a holding also was attributed to &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse.&lt;/i&gt; But, in a rather confused opinion, the court appears to adopt the view that the exculpatory clause presupposed the tug's seaworthiness which in fact was negatived by the absence of a sufficient crew. Thus the clause was inapplicable. 268 F., at 453. The decision was affirmed in this Court on the ground that, as a matter of construction and in accordance with English decisions, the clause meant only that the tug should not be liable if it had rendered reasonable assistance to the barge. Holding that the tug had not done so, the Court stated: "This makes it unnecessary for us to consider the contention on behalf of the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*112&lt;/span&gt; barge that the exemption clause is void." &lt;i&gt;British Columbia Mills Tug &amp;amp; Barge Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mylroie,&lt;/i&gt; 259 U. S. 1, 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequent developments have not made the Ninth Circuit's position any clearer. In &lt;i&gt;Sacramento Navigation Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Salz,&lt;/i&gt; 3 F. 2d 759, reversed here on other grounds, 273 U. S. 326, that Circuit considered a contract between the owner of a barge and a shipper of merchandise which excused the former from liability for "dangers of fire and navigation." The tug, also owned by the bargeowner, negligently caused loss of the barge and its cargo. The court dismissed the contention that the bargeowner might avoid liability under the quoted provision of the contract expressly as a matter of construction, and, in so doing, indicated that &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse, The Oceanica,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mylroie&lt;/i&gt; merely reflected differing constructions of exculpatory clauses.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; This opinion thus chose to ignore the dicta of &lt;i&gt;Mylroie.&lt;/i&gt; But subsequent dicta in &lt;i&gt;Hall-Scott Motor Car Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Universal Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 122 F. 2d 531, indicate that, at least as of 1941, the Ninth Circuit felt that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*113&lt;/span&gt; precedent in this Court and that Circuit's own decisions had established the invalidity of towage release-from-negligence clauses. In that case, the court reviewed the towage cases in considering analogies to the case before it, one in which a pleasure cruiser being repaired in dry dock was lost through fire and the principal defense was based on a clause in the repair contract stating that the repairer "will not be held responsible for any damage to cruiser `Pacifica' . . . while the engine installation is being made." The court stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This court has held that a contract relieving a towing vessel from the results of its negligence is void and has based its decisions upon the decision of the Supreme Court in 1870, in the case of The Steamer Syracuse . . . ," citing &lt;i&gt;Alaska Commercial&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mylroie.&lt;/i&gt; 122 F. 2d, at 535.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reviewing contra decisions in other circuits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Supreme Court has unquestionably settled this difference in Compania de Navegacion v. Phoenix [&lt;i&gt;sic&lt;/i&gt;] Ins. Co., 277 U. S. 66 . . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If these decisions of the Supreme Court and of this court are applicable to a maritime contract to repair a ship it is clear that such a contract to exculpate the contractor for his negligence is invalid." 122 F. 2d, at 535-536.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court decided, however, that the principles of the &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil&lt;/i&gt; case were instead to be applied, holding the exculpatory clause valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. It is safe to say that, aside from temporary intra-circuit conflicts within the Second Circuit,&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; never since &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*114&lt;/span&gt; ordinary towage has been recognized as not amounting to common carriage&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; has there been a decision in any district court holding invalid clauses which were clearly designed to relieve a tug from liability in the course of its service as a private carrier. Every decision is either limited to a construction of the clause or, if expressions concerning validity appear, they are the merest dicta.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*115&lt;/span&gt; INTERPRETATION AND VALIDITY OF THE EXCULPATORY TOWAGE CLAUSE.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not presented with a longstanding admiralty rule based on public policy invalidating contracts releasing towers from all liability for their negligence. In fact, we are presented with no rule other than that of the Second Circuit and those following it. Private parties have been free for over a century and a half to contract with reference to the rights and liabilities incident to towage. We cannot assume that they have been misled into a contrary belief. Critical analysis of the authorities, both in this country and in England,&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt; would not indicate that this freedom had been circumscribed by judicial decision.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*116&lt;/span&gt; If deference to Congress as the arbiter of public policy is called for, see &lt;i&gt;Wilburn Boat Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fireman's Fund Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 348 U. S. 310; &lt;i&gt;Halcyon Lines&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Haenn Ship Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 342 U. S. 282, certainly it should lead us not to upset a practice of the shipping industry sanctioned by the courts most concerned with it. And if inferences are to be drawn from existing legislation, it may be significant that Congress' careful regulation of freedom to limit liability in the case of public carriers of passengers or cargo (46 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 183c, 190-192, 1300-1308) is, either expressly or by virtue of the judicial "gloss" placed upon these sections, inapplicable to the usual tug-tow relationship. This suggests that, in the view of Congress, there is no overriding public policy requiring similar limitations in the field of private towage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Court has not, to be sure, in every instance awaited congressional action before imposing views of public policy upon contracting parties. But it has limited its interference in the field of transportation to relationships between common carriers and their customers, concededly not the relationship before us. We have held that the towage relationship is even less than one of marine bailment, &lt;i&gt;Stevens&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;The White City,&lt;/i&gt; 285 U. S. 195, as to which, under the rulings of the lower federal &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*117&lt;/span&gt; courts, public policy does not invalidate exculpatory clauses. &lt;i&gt;Newport News Shipbuilding &amp;amp; Dry Dock Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 34 F. 2d 100 (C. A. 4th Cir.); &lt;i&gt;Hall-Scott Motor Car Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Universal Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 122 F. 2d 531 (C. A. 9th Cir.); see &lt;i&gt;International Mercantile Marine S. S. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;W. &amp;amp; A. Fletcher Co.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;296&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;855&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 860 (C. A. 2d Cir.); Restatement, Contracts, &#167;&#167; 574, 575.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The considerations which have governed this Court's role as arbiter of the public interest in exculpatory contracts were recently enunciated by the unanimous Court in the &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil&lt;/i&gt; case. They bear repetition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"So far as concerns the service to be rendered under the agreement, respondent was not a common carrier or bailee or bound to serve or liable as such. Towage does not involve bailment . . . . There is no foundation in this case for the application of the doctrine that common carriers and others under like duty to serve the public . . . cannot by any form of agreement secure exemption from liability for loss or damage caused by their own negligence. . . . Respondent had no exclusive privilege or monopoly. . . . There is nothing to suggest that the parties were not on equal footing or that they did not deal at arm's length." 287 U. S., at 294.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These considerations of policy are equally present here and call for the result reached in &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing in the record hints at any inequality of bargaining power between the parties to this contract, nor is there any basis for taking judicial notice that the tug industry as an industry is in concentrated ownership.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*118&lt;/span&gt; The towing service was here undertaken by a Government corporation. Certainly we cannot assume that the Government is exploiting the maritime services it is rendering in an unreasonable or coercive manner. Nor was it suggested that no tug company available for the services involved would consent to deletion of the exculpatory clause upon payment of a reasonable consideration. Nor are we informed as to whether such clauses were uniformly found in the standard contracts offered by tug companies in the locality. Had such uniformity of practice been shown, it would not necessarily reflect more than universal satisfaction with such an arrangement; it would hardly demonstrate need for judicial wardship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument is made that permitting the parties to grant immunity to the tug will stimulate irresponsibility, or, at least, that it is necessary to force the tug to bear losses resulting from its negligence in order to provide an &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*119&lt;/span&gt; incentive to reasonable care. In the commercial setting of the towage industry this argument has little force, unless we are prepared also to forbid the tug to insure against such losses or liabilities. If not, then the question ultimately is whether public policy requires that the tug, rather than the tow, shall bear the cost of insurance. Indeed, in all likelihood, the economic burden will fall upon the tow in either case. In the absence of anything in the record, or any facts of which this Court may take judicial notice, that the tug has exploited an unfair bargaining position, there is no reason why the parties should not be free to distribute this cost as they see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is suggested that a distinction should be drawn between exemption of pilots from liability and exemption of towers. Reliance is placed on the unique position of pilots in the maritime world and the extensive regulation to which they are subjected: they are assimilated to public officers. If the pilotage involved in &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil&lt;/i&gt; took place in the detailed regulatory context thus suggested, decision in this case should follow &lt;i&gt;a fortiori&lt;/i&gt; from &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil&lt;/i&gt; in allowing the agreement of the parties to stand. For quasi-public status and detailed regulation of the qualifications for, and manner of, doing business, with the limited competition which such regulation constrains, are characteristic of the public carrier. If the result in &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil&lt;/i&gt; was reached despite similarities that brought the situation in proximity to decisions denying common carriers the right to contract against liability for negligence, the absence of these factors here emphasizes the applicability of the analysis of that case to the problem before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is in each of these cases decided today a question of construction of the exculpatory clause. We have noted that the courts have wisely insisted on clear language to avoid the incidents which the law, apart from the voluntary arrangements of the parties, applies to the towage relationship. In the present case, the clause used seems &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*120&lt;/span&gt; proof against a construction which would exclude from its operation negligence of the tug. The clause provides that the service is to be done "at the sole risk" of the tow, that the tug is not to be "liable for any loss or damage . . . however occurring" and finally that the master and crew of the tug "shall become and be the servants" of the tow whether or not the tow "assists in the service in any way and irrespective of whether they be aboard . . . or in command" of the tow.&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Court held that, while the "sole risk" clause did not sufficiently spell out an exemption from liability &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*121&lt;/span&gt; for negligence resulting in injury to the tow, the other clause, termed the "pilotage clause," did so. The Court of Appeals held that both reached the liability involved, citing the decision of the Second Circuit in &lt;i&gt;The Oceanica.&lt;/i&gt; Whether or not the "sole risk" phraseology is sufficiently different from that involved in &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; ("risk") to justify construing it to avoid liability here, the declaration that the tug's personnel are to be considered the servants of the tow, read in context, does manifest an intention that the tug shall not be held liable for injury to the tow. Here the clause makes it clear that the tug's crew are to be regarded as the servants of the tow whether or not there is in fact any direction or control exercised by the tow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would affirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  "It is unnecessary to consider the evidence relating to the alleged contract of towage, because, if it be true, as the appellant says, that, by special agreement, the canal-boat was being towed at her own risk, nevertheless, the steamer is liable, if, through the negligence of those in charge of her, the canal-boat has suffered loss. Although the policy of the law has not imposed on the towing boat the obligation resting on a common carrier, it does require on the part of the persons engaged in her management, the exercise of reasonable care, caution, and maritime skill, and if these are neglected, and disaster occurs, the towing boat must be visited with the consequences. It is admitted in the argument, and proved by the evidence, that the canal-boat was not to blame, and the inquiry, therefore, is, was the steamer equally without fault?" &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;167&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 171.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[12]  "Such a bargain doubtless means something; but it is contrary to public policy to so construe a contract of that nature that the tower is allowed to go clear of all liability when it is shown that he has relaxed his faithfulness and duty in performing the service." &lt;i&gt;Ulrich&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;The Sunbeam,&lt;/i&gt; 24 Fed. Cas. 515 (1878). See Note, 175 A. L. R. 8, 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[13]  Writers have differed as to the validity of such towage clauses. Of two leading authors on admiralty one regards the clauses as valid, 1 Benedict, Admiralty (6th ed. 1940), &#167; 100, and the other regards them as invalid, saying "Thus obliquely it seems to be settled that the contract exempting the tug from its negligence is not valid." Robinson, Admiralty (1939), 672.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[18]  Part III of the Interstate Commerce Act regulates tugs as common carriers under some circumstances and as contract carriers under others. 54 Stat. 929-952, 49 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 901-923. See &lt;i&gt;Cornell Steamboat Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 321 U. S. 634. Apart from statutes towboats sometimes operate in such way that they are held to be common carriers. See note 9, &lt;i&gt;supra.&lt;/i&gt; And it is a long settled policy that common carriers cannot by contract escape all liability for their own negligence. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Liverpool &amp;amp; Great Western Steam Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Phenix Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 129 U. S. 397, 438-443. An examination of the cases, however, discloses the difficulty of determining when a tug is or is not operating as a common carrier.&lt;/p&gt;

A further illustration of the monopoly potential of the tug business is suggested in &lt;i&gt;Boston Metals Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;The Winding Gulf&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; decided today, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 122. Petitioner in that case insisted before the Court of Appeals that if given an opportunity it could present evidence showing that when it executed the contract containing the proscribed clause with the Foundation Maritime of Canada that company had a virtual monopoly in all eastern Canadian seaports and that the petitioner's boat could not have been moved at all unless it agreed to the conditions forced on it in that contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[20]  The Second Circuit has taken this position. &lt;i&gt;North River Barge Line&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chile S. S. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 213 F. 2d 882, 884 (1954). &lt;i&gt;The Oceanica&lt;/i&gt; was adhered to, but apparently on slightly different grounds from those originally relied on. Holding a towage agreement for exemption from negligence valid, the court said, "A contrary dictum in The Syracuse . . . was approved in [&lt;i&gt;The Wash Gray&lt;/i&gt;]. But we think that Sun Oil . . . is to be taken as, in effect, accepting the doctrine of The Oceanica."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[21]  "When the captain of any tug engaged in the services of towing a vessel which is making use of her own propelling power goes on board said vessel, it is understood and agreed that said tugboat captain becomes the servant of the owners in respect to the giving of orders to any of the tugs engaged in the towage service and in respect to the handling of such vessel, and neither the tugs nor their owners or agents shall be liable for any damage resulting therefrom." 287 U. S., at 292-293.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an English historical account see Bowen, &lt;i&gt;A Hundred Years of Towage&lt;/i&gt; (1933).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  If they are common carriers, they may be subject to pervasive regulation by the Interstate Commerce Commission under Part III of the Interstate Commerce Act, 54 Stat. 898, 929, 49 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 901, 905 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; as &lt;i&gt;Cornell Steamboat Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; held. If they are contract carriers, certain of their activities may likewise be subject to regulation under that Act. See, for example, 49 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 906 (e), 907 (i), 913-917.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Available statistics of the tugboat industry do not show the breakdown, port by port, between common carriers and contract carriers. Nor do they show how many of the contract carriers are "captive" carriers, servicing one company. Nor do they give a picture of the competitive or monopolistic conditions prevailing in the various ports. We would need an economic brief to enlighten us, if we were to undertake to reformulate the established rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  It is significant that the only contractual dispute in the case related to whether or not this receipt formed a part of the contract between the parties. See 12 Wall., at 169. It is to this dispute that the Court directed itself in its opening statement that it was "unnecessary to consider the evidence relating to the alleged contract of towage." Apparently this clause was designed to prevent a tug from being held to a standard stricter than that of ordinary care, which libellant argued should be imposed if the receipt was not a part of the contract. Cf. note 3, &lt;i&gt;infra.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  See also &lt;i&gt;New York Central R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;The Talisman,&lt;/i&gt; 288 U. S. 239, 242, stating the determinative facts of the &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil&lt;/i&gt; case to be that "the towage company was not bound to render the service there involved and was not a common carrier or liable as such. That case, and the cases cited which arose under contracts for towage, plainly have no application . . . ."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  The Court of Appeals did not there purport to differ with any decision of this Court on the question of validity of exculpatory towage clauses. It said of &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse:&lt;/i&gt; "The learned judge must have meant that an agreement by the tow to tow at her own risk should not be construed to cover the tug's negligence." 170 F., at 895. The Court of Appeals felt justified in reaching a different construction of a similar agreement because it had become clear that a tug is not in relation to the tow a common carrier and thus, the court reasoned, no risk could now be referred to by such clauses except the tug's negligence. The discussion of the majority related entirely to construction, not to validity. The later statement on rehearing&#151;"We do appreciate keenly that the decision of the majority of the court as to the right of a tug to contract against her own negligence is a departure from previous decisions. The question should, and we hope will, be set at rest in this case by the Supreme Court," 170 F., at 900&#151;must either inaccurately express the meaning of the court or refer to the fact that at that time the cautious constructional approach of the lower federal courts had produced no affirmance of the validity of such clauses and one decision which, upon an analogy since discredited, had declared them invalid. See n. 11, &lt;i&gt;infra.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  209 F. 2d 410, rev'd, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 122. In the course of its opinion, the Court of Appeals stated:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are not called upon to decide whether the owner of a tug or the tug itself, which is operating under a contract containing the standard towing conditions, may ever escape liability to a third party for injuries caused by its negligence." 209 F. 2d, at 414.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In context, however, it is clear that this merely amounts to a reservation of the question whether the third party's right to sue the tug was affected by the pilotage clause. In permitting the third party to recover directly from the tow owner by virtue of the clause, the Fourth Circuit necessarily affirmed the right of the tug to shift the burden of liability to the tow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  The clause involved stated:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When a vessel is towed or pushed stern first by one tug, the service will be under the control and direction of the master of the vessel so assisted, and the tug will not be liable for any damages that may be sustained or caused . . . ."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tug in this case had been engaged in pushing a steamer stern first away from its pier when the bow of the steamer struck the dock. The Court of Appeals held the quoted clause inapplicable because in fact the tug had not been operating under the control and direction of the master of the steamer. No question of the validity of an exculpatory clause was involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  A clause substantially similar to that involved in the earlier &lt;i&gt;Great Lakes&lt;/i&gt; case, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; n. 5, was likewise construed to be inapplicable on the ground that the tug had been operating independently of any direction from the tow at the time of the accident. In the course of the opinion the court stated:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Were we therefore compelled to decide the case upon the validity of paragraph 17, it might seem to us that decision must be controlled by the doctrine of The Syracuse, whatever might be our own views of the principle or its applicability to the present case. A narrower ground for decision, however, appears." 165 F. 2d, at 371.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  This case involved, apparently, towage under a clause similar to that considered in &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse,&lt;/i&gt; stating that the service was to be performed "at the owner's risk." It was contended that this clause relieved the tug from liability for loss of one of the towed vessels which sank in the wake of a larger vessel. The court merely stated: "This contention cannot be sustained under the authorities," 184 F. 2d, at 531, citing &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Wash Gray&lt;/i&gt; without indicating that they involved more than construction of similar clauses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  ". . . The exceptions therein expressed extend only to dangers of fire and navigation . . . and they apply only to the barge, and not to the tug . . . . No tug was referred to in connection with the contract of transportation. The exemption clause, therefore, does not excuse negligent towage. The Steamer Syracuse, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;167&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . . . Alaska Commercial Co. v. Williams . . . Mylroie v. British Columbia Mills Tug &amp;amp; Barge Co. . . .
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The appellant cites The Oceanica . . . [there the Second Circuit], while accepting the rule that a contract will not be construed to cover the carrier's negligence, unless the intention to do so is expressly stated, held, one judge dissenting, that a tug, being only liable for negligence, if the tow agrees to assume all risks, no risks can be meant, except . . . the consequences of her own negligence. . . . We think that it is a departure from the principles announced in the decisions of the Supreme Court which we have cited. It may be said, by way of distinguishing . . . The Oceanica . . . that the court found in the terms thereof an intention of the contracting parties to absolve the tug from the consequences of its own negligence, whereas, in the case at bar, the contract is wholly between a shipper of cargo and the owner of the barge . . . ." 3 F. 2d, at 761.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9]  Compare &lt;i&gt;Petterson Lighterage &amp;amp; Towing Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;The J. Raymond Russell,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/nysd/biW1/petterson-light-tow-corp-v-the-j-raymond-russell/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;87&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;467&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (viewing &lt;i&gt;The Oceanica&lt;/i&gt; as having been overruled by &lt;i&gt;The Wash Gray&lt;/i&gt;), with &lt;i&gt;The Primrose,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;267&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The John J. Feeney,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;270&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (viewing exculpatory clauses as valid). The Court of Appeals has, however, consistently held to the views enunciated in &lt;i&gt;The Oceanica&lt;/i&gt; and has resolved all such conflicts in favor of the validity of exculpatory towage clauses. That decision was a departure from its earlier narrow construction of exculpatory towage clauses, see &lt;i&gt;The Edmund L. Levy,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;128&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;683&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;i&gt;The Syracuse,&lt;/i&gt; 23 Fed. Cas. 593, No. 13,717; aff'd &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;167&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but not from any decision turning upon validity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[10]  Of course there may be instances where, because of the mode and circumstances of operation, or for purposes of regulatory statutes, towage may be held to involve common carriage. See &lt;i&gt;Cornell Steamboat Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 321 U. S. 634.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[11]  Among the cases cited for the proposition that such clauses are invalid, one, &lt;i&gt;The Rescue,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;190&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (D. C. W. D. Pa.), may so hold, but if so on the theory that towage is equivalent to common carriage, a view not now tenable. Two others, &lt;i&gt;The Monarch,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;235&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;795&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 799 (D. C. N. D. Fla.), and &lt;i&gt;The Sea Lion,&lt;/i&gt; 12 F. 2d 124, 126 (D. C. N. D. Calif.), contain dicta to the effect that such clauses are invalid. In both cases, however, it was held that the tug was not negligent and the libels were dismissed. Contrary dicta are found in four other cases. &lt;i&gt;The Pacific Maru,&lt;/i&gt; 8 F. 2d 166, 170-173 (D. C. S. D. Ga.); &lt;i&gt;Compania de Navegacion, Interior, S. A.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fireman's Fund Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 14 F. 2d 196, 200, aff'd 277 U. S. 66; &lt;i&gt;Mengel Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Inland Waterways Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/laed/8tyA/mengel-co-v-inland-waterways-corporation/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;685&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 690-692; &lt;i&gt;Compania de Navegacion Cristobal, S.

Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;560&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 561 (all D. C. E. D. La.). All other cases do not expressly go further than to determine that the clause involved did not, as a matter of construction, operate to relieve the tug from liability for the particular negligence involved. These include &lt;i&gt;The Somers N. Smith,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;120&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;569&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (D.

Cas. 515, No. 14,329 (D. C. N. J.); &lt;i&gt;Vanderslice&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;The Superior,&lt;/i&gt; 28 Fed. Cas. 970, No. 16,843 (D. C. E. D. Pa.); &lt;i&gt;The Skagway,&lt;/i&gt; 1925 Am. Mar. Cas. 1133 (D. C. W. D. Wash.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[12]  English law recognizes the validity of tug-tow contracts releasing the tug from liability for its own negligence. &lt;i&gt;E. g., The Albion,&lt;/i&gt; [1953] 2 All Eng. 679 (C. A.); &lt;i&gt;The Ramsden,&lt;/i&gt; [1943] P. D. 46; &lt;i&gt;The Tasmania,&lt;/i&gt; 13 P. D. 110; &lt;i&gt;The United Service,&lt;/i&gt; 9 P. D. 3 (C. A.); &lt;i&gt;The President Van Buren,&lt;/i&gt; 16 Aspinall's Rep. (N. S.) 444; see Marsden, Collisions at Sea (10th ed. 1953), p. 216.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as has been true of decisions in this country, however, specific language directed at liability for negligence must be used. Thus, where the contract merely stated "all transporting to be at owners' risk," the tower was held liable. The phrase was interpreted merely to mean that if the tug exercised reasonable care and skill the tow would incur the risks incidental to navigation. &lt;i&gt;The Forfarshire,&lt;/i&gt; [1908] P. D. 339; see also, &lt;i&gt;The West Cock,&lt;/i&gt; [1911] P. D. 208 (C. A.). The parallel to &lt;i&gt;The Steamer Syracuse&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Wash Gray&lt;/i&gt; requires no elaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[13]  1 Benedict on Admiralty (5th ed. 1925), p. 167, asserts that a "towage contractor . . . may by contract limit or disclaim liability for negligence." Griffin, American Law of Collision (1949), pp. 462-466, after detailed examination of the cases, concludes that the apparent conflict is over construction rather than validity. Robinson on Admiralty (1939), pp. 670-673, suggests that &lt;i&gt;The Wash Gray&lt;/i&gt; seems "obliquely" to indicate a contrary rule, but juxtaposes the &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil&lt;/i&gt; case without resolution of its inconsistency with such a view of &lt;i&gt;The Wash Gray.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leading encyclopedias of American case law note an apparent conflict among the circuits on the question of validity of the tug-tow exculpatory contracts. They do not suggest that there is controlling authority in this Court, and tend to support the validity of such exemption. 86 Corpus Juris Secundum (1954) 1038 ("It has been judicially noted that the apparent conflict in authority may arise from failure to use sufficiently unequivocal language in the release clause."); 63 Corpus Juris (1933) 60, &#167; 136 ("it has been said that such question has not yet been authoritatively determined."); 48 American Jurisprudence (1943) 346, &#167; 508 ("Although there are some holdings to the contrary, the weight of judicial opinion seems to favor the view that it is competent for a tower, by a stipulation assented to by the tow, to exempt itself from liability for loss or injury caused by its own negligence.").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[14]  There exists no comprehensive study of the towing industry directed to the considerations important in determining whether or not it is characterized by monopolistic tendencies or inequalities of bargaining power. However, a study of transportation lines in the United States prepared by the Corps of Engineers, United States Army, lists more than 950 concerns which are described as engaging in towing operations of general or specialized character throughout the United States. See Transportation Lines on the Great Lakes System, 1955 (Transportation Series 3); Transportation Lines on the Mississippi River System and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, 1954 (Transportation Series 4); Transportation Lines on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific Coasts, 1954 (Transportation Series 5). In addition, there are numerous towing concerns which operate within a single port not listed in these studies but shown in individual studies of specific ports. Port Series Reports, prepared by the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors. These sources reveal that more than 140 concerns were engaged in towing petroleum products on the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers, or general towage operations on these rivers, which is the service involved in this case. It is impossible to tell how many of these concerns would have been available to petitioner for the services which the Federal Barge Lines rendered. But these rough figures carry no suggestion of the factors which have in the past led us to invalidate clauses relieving from liability for negligence, for they certainly do not warrant an assumption that towage enjoys a monopolistic or comparable economically coercive position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[15]  The clause states in full:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(4) The movement contemplated will be done at the sole risk of the `craft to be towed' and its cargo and neither the boats and/or any other equipment used in said service nor the owner, charterer, or hirer thereof shall be liable for any loss or damage to the `craft to be towed' or its cargo nor for any damage done by the `craft to be towed,' however occurring. The masters and crews and employees of all boats and/or other equipment assisting the `craft to be towed' shall, in the performance of said service, become and be the servants of the `craft to be towed,' regardless of whether the `craft to be towed' assists in the service in any way and irrespective of whether they be aboard the `craft to be towed' or in command thereof. Nothing herein contained, however, shall be construed as making the `craft to be towed,' its owners, charterers or operators liable or responsible for loss of or damage to the property of Federal Barge Lines or third parties or for loss of life or personal injury for which the `craft to be towed' its owners, charterers or operators would not otherwise be liable or responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(5) `Owner' agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Federal Barge Lines from any liability to or for account of the crew of the `craft to be towed' because of any accident, damage, injury or loss of life to the said crew, or any loss of personal property or effects of the said crew, however arising, and the `owner' agrees to defend any and all suits or other actions which may be brought against Federal Barge Lines by or for account of the members of such crews for the reasons aforesaid, and to pay, satisfy, or discharge any and all judgments that may be rendered therein, to the full acquittance and discharge of Federal Barge Lines."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Argued April 20, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided May 16, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MICHIGAN.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;William L. Colden&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;James A. Cobb, George E. C. Hayes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Charles W. Jones.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Edmund E. Shepherd,&lt;/i&gt; Solicitor General, argued the cause for the State of Michigan, respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Thomas M. Kavanagh,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;Daniel J. O'Hara,&lt;/i&gt; Assistant Attorney General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michigan law authorizes any judge of its courts of record to act as a so-called "one-man grand jury."&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; He can compel witnesses to appear before him in secret to testify about suspected crimes. We have previously held that such a Michigan "judge-grand jury" cannot consistently with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment summarily convict a witness of contempt for &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*134&lt;/span&gt; conduct in the secret hearings. &lt;i&gt;In re Oliver,&lt;/i&gt; 333 U. S. 257. We held that before such a conviction could stand, due process requires as a minimum that an accused be given a public trial after reasonable notice of the charges, have a right to examine witnesses against him, call witnesses on his own behalf, and be represented by counsel. The question now before us is whether a contempt proceeding conducted in accordance with these standards complies with the due process requirement of an impartial tribunal where the same judge presiding at the contempt hearing had also served as the "one-man grand jury" out of which the contempt charges arose. This does not involve, of course, the long-exercised power of courts summarily to punish certain conduct occurring in open court.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petitioners, Murchison and White, were called as witnesses before a "one-man judge-grand jury." Murchison, a Detroit policeman, was interrogated at length in the judge's secret hearings where questions were asked him about suspected gambling in Detroit and bribery of policemen. His answers left the judge persuaded that he had committed perjury, particularly in view of other evidence before the "judge-grand jury." The judge then charged Murchison with perjury and ordered him to appear and show cause why he should not be punished for criminal contempt.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; White, the other petitioner, was &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*135&lt;/span&gt; also summoned to appear as a witness in the same "one-man grand jury" hearing. Asked numerous questions about gambling and bribery, he refused to answer on the ground that he was entitled under Michigan law to have counsel present with him. The "judge-grand jury" charged White with contempt and ordered him to appear and show cause. The judge who had been the "grand jury" then tried both petitioners in open court, convicted and sentenced them for contempt. Petitioners objected to being tried for contempt by this particular judge for a number of reasons including: (1) Michigan law expressly provides that a judge conducting a "one-man grand jury" inquiry will be disqualified from hearing or trying any case arising from his inquiry or from hearing any motion to dismiss or quash any complaint or indictment growing out of it, or from hearing any charge of contempt "except alleged contempt for neglect or refusal to appear in response to a summons or subpoena"; (2) trial before the judge who was at the same time the complainant, indicter and prosecutor, constituted a denial of the fair and impartial trial required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The trial judge answered the first challenge by holding that the state statute barring him from trying the contempt cases violated the Michigan Constitution on the ground that it would deprive a judge of inherent power to punish contempt. This interpretation of the Michigan Constitution is binding here. As to the second challenge &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*136&lt;/span&gt; the trial judge held that due process did not forbid him to try the contempt charges. He also rejected other constitutional contentions made by petitioners. The State Supreme Court sustained all the trial judge's holdings and affirmed.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; Importance of the federal constitutional questions raised caused us to grant certiorari.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; The view we take makes it unnecessary for us to consider or decide any of those questions except the due process challenge to trial by the judge who had conducted the secret "one-man grand jury" proceedings.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process. Fairness of course requires an absence of actual bias in the trial of cases. But our system of law has always endeavored to prevent even the probability of unfairness. To this end no man can be a judge in his own case and no man is permitted to try cases where he has an interest in the outcome. That interest cannot be defined with precision. Circumstances and relationships must be considered. This Court has said, however, that "every procedure which would offer a possible temptation to the average man as a judge . . . not to hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused, denies the latter due process of law." &lt;i&gt;Tumey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ohio,&lt;/i&gt; 273 U. S. 510, 532. Such a stringent rule may sometimes bar trial by judges who have no actual bias and who would do their very best to weigh the scales of justice equally between contending parties. But to perform its high function in the best way "justice must satisfy the appearance of justice." &lt;i&gt;Offutt&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 348 U. S. 11, 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*137&lt;/span&gt; It would be very strange if our system of law permitted a judge to act as a grand jury and then try the very persons accused as a result of his investigations. Perhaps no State has ever forced a defendant to accept grand jurors as proper trial jurors to pass on charges growing out of their hearings.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; A single "judge-grand jury" is even more a part of the accusatory process than an ordinary lay grand juror. Having been a part of that process a judge cannot be, in the very nature of things, wholly disinterested in the conviction or acquittal of those accused. While he would not likely have all the zeal of a prosecutor, it can certainly not be said that he would have none of that zeal.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; Fair trials are too important a part of our free society to let prosecuting judges be trial judges of the charges they prefer.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; It is true that contempt committed in a trial courtroom can under some circumstances be punished summarily by the trial judge. See &lt;i&gt;Cooke&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 267 U. S. 517, 539. But adjudication by a trial judge of a contempt committed in his immediate presence in open court cannot be likened to the proceedings here. For we held in the &lt;i&gt;Oliver&lt;/i&gt; case that a person charged with contempt before a "one-man grand jury" could not be summarily tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*138&lt;/span&gt; As a practical matter it is difficult if not impossible for a judge to free himself from the influence of what took place in his "grand-jury" secret session. His recollection of that is likely to weigh far more heavily with him than any testimony given in the open hearings. That it sometimes does is illustrated by an incident which occurred in White's case. In finding White guilty of contempt the trial judge said, "there is one thing the record does not show, and that was Mr. White's attitude, and I must say that his attitude was almost insolent in the manner in which he answered questions and his attitude upon the witness stand. . . . Not only was the personal attitude insolent, but it was defiant, and I want to put that on the record." In answer to defense counsel's motion to strike these statements because they were not part of the original record the judge said, "That is something . . . that wouldn't appear on the record, but it would be very evident to the court." Thus the judge whom due process requires to be impartial in weighing the evidence presented before him, called on his own personal knowledge and impression of what had occurred in the grand jury room and his judgment was based in part on this impression, the accuracy of which could not be tested by adequate cross-examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incident also shows that the judge was doubtless more familiar with the facts and circumstances in which the charges were rooted than was any other witness. There were no public witnesses upon whom petitioners could call to give disinterested testimony concerning what took place in the secret chambers of the judge. If there had been they might have been able to refute the judge's statement about White's insolence. Moreover, as shown by the judge's statement here, a "judge-grand jury" might himself many times be a very material witness in a later trial for contempt. If the charge should be heard before &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*139&lt;/span&gt; that judge, the result would be either that the defendant must be deprived of examining or cross-examining him or else there would be the spectacle of the trial judge presenting testimony upon which he must finally pass in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; In either event the State would have the benefit of the judge's personal knowledge while the accused would be denied an effective opportunity to cross-examine. The right of a defendant to examine and cross-examine witnesses is too essential to a fair trial to have that right jeopardized in such way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hold that it was a violation of due process for the "judge-grand jury" to try these petitioners, and it was therefore error for the Supreme Court of Michigan to uphold the convictions. The judgments are reversed and the causes are remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE REED and MR. JUSTICE MINTON, dissenting, with whom MR. JUSTICE BURTON joins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court holds that it is unconstitutional for a state judge to punish a contempt, previously committed before him while acting as a so-called one-man grand jury, after a full hearing in open court. It holds that White, in being so punished for his blanket refusal to answer any questions before the grand jury, and Murchison, in being so punished for perjury before the same body, were deprived of their liberty without due process of law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conclusion is not rested on any irregularity in the proceedings before either the grand jury or the court. Under Michigan procedure a single state judge makes the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*140&lt;/span&gt; grand jury investigation, not in secret, but with other public officials to aid him, and a transcript is made of the testimony. There is certainly nothing unconstitutional about this. A State may reduce the customary number of grand jurors to one, and impart the investigatory duty to a member of its judiciary if it so desires. Further, the accused is afforded a full hearing in open court, with a statement of charges, benefit of counsel, and a full opportunity to explain his conduct before the grand jury, before being held in contempt. Thus all the requirements set down in &lt;i&gt;In re Oliver,&lt;/i&gt; 333 U. S. 257, are met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court's determination is rested on the sole fact that the same judge first cited petitioners for contempt committed in his presence, and then presided over the proceedings leading to the final adjudication. It is neither shown nor alleged that the state judge was in any way biased. Nor is this required by the Court, for it holds, as a matter of law, that the judge's "interest" in a conviction makes the proceedings inherently prejudicial and thus constitutionally invalid. The fact that the "interest" of the state judge in this procedure is no different from that of other judges who have traditionally punished for contempt leads us to dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Sacher&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 343 U. S. 1, we upheld the power of a federal district judge to summarily punish a contempt previously committed in his presence. In that case, after a trial which had extended for some nine months, the trial judge issued a certificate summarily holding defense counsel in contempt for their actions during the trial. There were no formalities, no hearings, no taking of evidence, no arguments and no briefs. We held that such a procedure was permitted by Rule 42 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which codified the "prevailing usages at law." The Court specifically rejected the contention that the judge who heard the contempt was disqualified from punishing it and should be required &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*141&lt;/span&gt; to assume the role of accuser or complaining witness before another judge. In &lt;i&gt;Offutt&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 348 U. S. 11, the Court simply stated an exception: when the trial judge becomes personally embroiled with the contemnor, he must step aside in favor of another judge. That decision was rested upon our supervisory authority over the administration of criminal justice in the federal courts. The Court now holds, even though there is no showing or contention that the state judge became embroiled or personally exercised, or was in any way biased, that as a matter of constitutional law&#151;of procedural due process&#151;a state judge may not punish a contempt previously committed in his presence. This seems inconsistent with all that has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court, presumably referring to the situation in the federal courts, states that the "adjudication by a trial judge of a contempt committed in his immediate presence in open court cannot be likened to the proceedings here." The reason that it cannot, we are told, is because "we held in the &lt;i&gt;Oliver&lt;/i&gt; case that a person charged with contempt before a `one-man grand jury' could not be summarily tried." This is hardly explanatory, for the question of whether the hearing is to be summary or plenary has no bearing on the attitude or "interest" of the judges in the two situations, which is indistinguishable. The simple fact is that in the federal courts we allow the same judge who hears the contempt and issues the certificate to punish it subsequently and summarily, but in this case we do not allow such punishment even after a full court trial. The only factual difference between &lt;i&gt;Sacher&lt;/i&gt; and this case is that the contempt in &lt;i&gt;Sacher&lt;/i&gt; was committed at a public trial. When the contempt is not committed in open court, we require that the criminal conviction be in public and that the individual be given a full hearing, with an opportunity to defend himself against the charges proffered and to make a record from which to appeal. &lt;i&gt;In re&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*142&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Oliver,&lt;/i&gt; 333 U. S. 257. Petitioners had all this. They are not entitled to more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not see how it can be held that it violates fundamental concepts of fair play and justice for a state judge after a full court trial to punish a contempt previously observed when acting as a grand jury, when it has been held that it is perfectly proper for a federal judge to summarily punish a contempt previously observed in open court. It seems to us that the Court has imposed a more stringent requirement on state judges as a matter of due process than we have imposed on federal judges over whom we exercise supervisory power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court relies heavily on &lt;i&gt;Tumey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ohio,&lt;/i&gt; 273 U. S. 510. There we held that it deprives a defendant of due process to "subject his liberty or property to the judgment of a court the judge of which has a direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary interest in reaching a conclusion against him in his case." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 523. It is one thing to hold that a judge has too great an interest in a case to permit the rendition of a fair verdict when his compensation is determined by the result he reaches. It is quite another thing to disqualify a state judge as having too great an interest to render a due process judgment when his sole interest, as shown by this record, is the maintenance of order and decorum in the investigation of crime&#151;an interest which he shares in common with all judges who punish for contempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State of Michigan has decided that in the administration of its criminal law it is wise to have the investigating power in the hands of a judge. It has also decided that the judge who observes the contempt is to preside at the trial of the contemnor. It does not seem that there is here such a violation of accepted judicial standards as to justify this Court's determination of unconstitutionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would affirm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[8]  Apparently the trial judge here did consider himself a part of the prosecution. In passing on a request by Murchison's counsel for a two-day postponement of the contempt trial the judge said, "There are two points that suggest themselves to me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One is that if the respondent is going to claim that he was in Shrewsberry, Ontario, Canada, on March 9, 1954, that &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; ought to be furnished with information so that &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; could between now and two days from now, which I am going to give you, &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; could do some checking and investigating &lt;i&gt;ourselves.&lt;/i&gt;" (Emphasis supplied.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Holland, Ellis N. Slack&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Hilbert P. Zarky&lt;/i&gt; filed briefs for the United States, as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae,&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1829 this Court decided in &lt;i&gt;Weston&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;City Council of Charleston,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Pet.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;449&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, that obligations of the Federal Government are immune from state taxation. This rule, aimed at protecting the borrowing power of the United States from state encroachment, was derived from the "Borrowing" and "Supremacy" Clauses of the Constitution,&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; and the constitutional doctrines announced in &lt;i&gt;McCulloch&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maryland,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/7LyH/mcculloch-v-maryland/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wheat.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;316&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1819). It was subsequently embodied in a succession of federal statutes, the existing statute being R. S. &#167; 3701, 31 U. S. C. &#167; 742.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; The rule has been carried forward to embrace indirect taxation of such obligations through their inclusion in a tax imposed on all the property of a taxpayer. It is quite immaterial that the state tax does not discriminate against the federal obligations. &lt;i&gt;New York ex rel. Bank of Commerce&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioners of Taxes,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Black&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;620&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1863); &lt;i&gt;Bank Tax Case,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1865); &lt;i&gt;Farmers &amp;amp; Mechanics Savings Bank&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Minnesota,&lt;/i&gt; 232 U. S. 516 (1914); &lt;i&gt;New Jersey Realty Title Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Division of Tax Appeals,&lt;/i&gt; 338 U. S. 665 (1950).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two cases now before us involve the application of that rule, in a somewhat novel situation. Society for Savings in the City of Cleveland and First Federal Savings &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*145&lt;/span&gt; and Loan Association of Warren,&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; two mutual savings banks having no capital stock or shareholders, and located in Ohio, attack the validity of an Ohio property tax, as assessed against them, on the ground that they were required to include in the property values upon which the tax was computed United States bonds held in their security portfolios. Had these bonds been excluded, the entire tax would have been wiped out in both instances.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; The Ohio Tax Commissioner thought these government bonds were not excludible. The Ohio Board of Tax Appeals reversed. The Supreme Court of Ohio sustained the Commissioner in each instance. The two banks are here by appeal from the judgment of the Ohio Supreme Court in each case.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; The cases were argued together, and are so treated in this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax in question was assessed in the names of these banks under &#167;&#167; 5408, 5412 and 5638-1 of the Ohio General Code,&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; upon the book value of their "capital employed, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*146&lt;/span&gt; or the property representing it" (&#167; 5408) "at the aggregate amount of the capital, the surplus or reserve fund and the undivided profits" (&#167; 5412). The tax was at the rate of two mills on the dollar (&#167; 5638-1). No claim is made that the taxes constituted a franchise tax or some other kind of privilege tax. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Educational Films Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ward,&lt;/i&gt; 282 U. S. 379 (1931).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court of Ohio recognized that this tax, based as it was upon the inclusion of federal obligations, would have to fall if directed against the banks. &lt;i&gt;New York ex rel. Bank of Commerce&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioners of&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*147&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Taxes, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bank Tax Case, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; This tax, though, was not considered to be against the banks. Holding that the depositors of a mutual savings bank have an interest similar to that of shareholders of other banks, the Ohio court found instead that the tax was imposed upon the "intangible property interests" of the depositors as the owners of each bank. The banks' capital, surplus fund and undivided profits, which we will refer to as their surplus, were regarded as not themselves the subject matter of the tax, but as simply the measure of the tax against the depositors, and the banks were treated as tax-collecting agents rather than as taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In so deciding the Ohio court relied upon a gloss on the rule of immunity stated above. It has been held that a state may impose a tax upon the stockholders' interests in a corporation, measured by corporate asset values, without making any deduction on account of United States securities held by the corporation. This doctrine had its origin in cases involving national bank stock. There, congressional consent to state taxation of the stock of national banks, upon certain conditions, was held, over strong dissent, to permit such taxes to be assessed without the exclusion of federal obligations owned by the banks. &lt;i&gt;Van Allen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Assessors,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/s5H/van-allen-v-assessors/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;573&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1866); &lt;i&gt;National Bank&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commonwealth,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/sd8/national-bank-v-commonwealth/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;353&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1870); &lt;i&gt;Des Moines National Bank&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fairweather,&lt;/i&gt; 263 U. S. 103 (1923). This result was reached in part on the theory that the stockholders' interests in a corporation represent a separate property interest from the corporation's ownership of its assets, so that a tax on the stockholders' interests is not a tax on the federal obligations which are included in the corporate property. This rationale has been carried over to cases involving stock of state-created banks, and thus a tax on their shareholders, though measured by corporate assets which include federal obligations, is held &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*148&lt;/span&gt; not to offend the rule immunizing such obligations from state taxation. &lt;i&gt;Cleveland Trust Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lander,&lt;/i&gt; 184 U. S. 111 (1902). Further, in levying a tax on shareholders, a state may require its payment by the corporation, as a collecting agent. &lt;i&gt;Corry&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Baltimore,&lt;/i&gt; 196 U. S. 466 (1905). The result is that when, as is usually the case, the shareholder tax is measured solely by corporate asset values, such a tax is difficult to distinguish from a tax imposed upon the corporation itself, so far as the practical impact of the two types of taxes upon corporate-owned federal obligations is concerned. Nevertheless, this exception to the general rule of immunity is firmly embedded in the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focal point of these appeals is thus whether we are to regard this tax as imposed on the banks or, as the Ohio court held the legislature intended, on their depositors. Were we free to construe Ohio's statute &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; we might have difficulty in reaching the conclusion which the Ohio court did. Suffice it to say at this point: The statute is barren of any language expressly imposing this tax on the depositors, and contains no provision giving the bank any right to recover the tax from the depositors, as might be expected if the bank had been regarded as a mere tax-collecting agent. By contrast, the taxes laid by the Ohio General Code on (a) the shares of incorporated financial institutions whose capital is divided into shares, (b) the shares of unincorporated institutions whose capital is divided into shares, and (c) deposits, are imposed on the shares "of the stockholders" (&#167; 5408) and on the deposits "as taxable property of its depositors" (&#167; 5673-2).&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; In the case of those taxes, not here involved, the bank is given full rights of reimbursement from the stockholders or depositors, as the case may be, and it is clear &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*149&lt;/span&gt; that the institution in paying such taxes is acting only as a collection agent. Ohio Gen. Code &#167;&#167; 5672, 5673, 5673-1, 5673-2.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And beyond these considerations, one might not have expected the legislature to tax the ownership interests of the depositors of these banks on the same basis as stock-holders &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*150&lt;/span&gt; are taxed. The asserted interest of the depositors is in the surplus of the bank, which is primarily a reserve against losses and secondarily a repository of undivided earnings. So long as the bank remains solvent, depositors receive a return on this fund only as an element of the interest paid on their deposits. To maintain their intangible ownership interest, they must maintain their deposits. If a depositor withdraws from the bank, he receives only his deposits and interest. If he continues, his only chance of getting anything more would be in the unlikely event of a solvent liquidation, a possibility that hardly rises to the level of an expectancy. It stretches the imagination very far to attribute any real value to such a remote contingency, and when coupled with the fact that it represents nothing which the depositor can readily transfer, any theoretical value reduces almost to the vanishing point. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Collett&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Springfield Savings Society,&lt;/i&gt; 13 Ohio Cir. Ct. Repts. 131, aff'd &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;56&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ohio St.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;776&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 49 N. E. 1109 (1897).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*151&lt;/span&gt; The Ohio court, however, has held that this tax is imposed on the depositors.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; But that does not end the matter for us. We must judge the true nature of this tax in terms of the rights and liabilities which the statute, as construed, creates. In assessing the validity of the tax under federal law, we are not bound by the state's conclusion that the tax is imposed on the depositors, even though we would be bound by the state court's decision as to what rights and liabilities this statute establishes under state law. The court's mere conclusion that the tax is imposed on the depositors is no more than a characterization of the tax. "Where a federal right is concerned we are not bound by the characterization given to a state tax by state courts or legislatures, or relieved by it from the duty of considering the real nature of the tax and its effect upon the federal right asserted." &lt;i&gt;Carpenter&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Shaw,&lt;/i&gt; 280 U. S. 363, 367 (1930). See also &lt;i&gt;New Jersey Realty Title Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Division of Tax Appeals, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 674; &lt;i&gt;Educational Films Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ward, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 387. "Neither ingenuity in calculation nor form of words in state enactments can deprive the owner of the tax exemption established for the benefit of the United States." &lt;i&gt;Missouri ex rel. Missouri Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gehner,&lt;/i&gt; 281 U. S. 313, 321 (1930). Therefore, we proceed to examine what rights and liabilities the statute creates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We note, first, that should the bank be unable to pay the tax, after it has been assessed, there is no provision entitling the State of Ohio to collect it from the depositors. A tax against the depositors which is recoverable only from the bank looks like a tax against the bank. And if the tax is in fact against the bank, it does not matter &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*152&lt;/span&gt; whether the ultimate economic impact is passed on to the depositors. &lt;i&gt;Home Savings Bank&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Des Moines,&lt;/i&gt; 205 U. S. 503, 519 (1907).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, it appears that the statute does not relieve the bank from having to pay the tax on the "intangible property interest" of a depositor who had an account with the bank on the assessment date of the tax, but has withdrawn his account before the collection date. And if the bank is required to pay on the former depositor's account, there is no provision entitling the bank to reimbursement from him. It should be observed that in the case of the deposit tax the statute does contain provisions protecting the bank in such a situation. &#167;&#167; 5412, 5673-1, 5673-2.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and perhaps most important, if this tax is on the depositors, we must find somewhere a right in the bank to make itself whole from the depositors for the taxes paid on their account. In all the cases upholding state taxes against shareholders, without the exclusion of federal obligations owned by the corporation, an express or implied right of reimbursement was presupposed. See &lt;i&gt;Van Allen&lt;/i&gt; and other cases at p. 147, &lt;i&gt;supra.&lt;/i&gt; As already observed, in the case of the Ohio taxes on shares and deposits the statute contains such a right (&#167;&#167; 5673, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*153&lt;/span&gt; 5673-2).&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; In the present cases we can find no such right. It may be true that where the tax paid by the bank is &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; than the interest which the bank &lt;i&gt;contemplates&lt;/i&gt; paying the depositors, no such right of reimbursement is necessary. If, for example, a bank has $100,000 of undivided profits, intends to pay its depositors $75,000 interest on their deposits, and has an obligation for this tax of $10,000, it perhaps makes no difference whether the bank pays $65,000 to its depositors, without recovering anything back from them, or pays them $75,000, but later recovers back the $10,000 tax paid for their account. Under either method the bank comes out whole, and the depositors receive the same net interest payment.&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt; But if the bank has &lt;i&gt;declared&lt;/i&gt; the $75,000 interest payment before the tax is due, we can find nothing in the statute which would give the bank the right either to deduct the $10,000 tax from the interest payment, or to recover it back from the depositors. And conceivably the tax might &lt;i&gt;exceed&lt;/i&gt; the interest payable to the depositors, in which event the bank would be left short, absent a right to recover the excess from the depositors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ohio court thought that in charging the tax to surplus, the bank in reality would be reducing the depositors' interest in the surplus, which it described as being "owned" by them, and that therefore in no circumstance was a right of reimbursement necessary. But there are difficulties with this proposition. If this means that the corporate fiction should be disregarded, the result would be that the government bonds would have to be excluded, since on this hypothesis such securities should then be treated as the property of the depositors. On the other &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*154&lt;/span&gt; hand, if the Ohio court was referring to the depositors' equitable interest in the surplus, as seems more likely, then without a right of recoupment the bank as well as the depositors bears the impact of the tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without provisions protecting the bank against the burdens of the tax, we cannot assume that the statute's operation will not infringe on the immunity of the federal obligations held by the banks. It is not adequate merely to suggest that a bank may be entitled to make itself whole from the depositors under Ohio common law. For no such common-law right has been called to our attention. Rather, the Ohio court's opinion indicates that the bank may be left without any right of reimbursement.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that this tax is on the depositors in name only, and that for federal purposes it must be held to be on the banks themselves. Accordingly, the judgments in both cases are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BURTON took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.&lt;/p&gt;

Such lien may be enforced in any appropriate manner at any time within six months after the payment of the taxes to the treasurer."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9]  As construed by the state court, the "intangible property tax" on depositors applied to different property than did the "deposit" tax also imposed on them, involving, as we see it, no question of duplication or overlapping between the two taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[10]  Section 5412 provides in part: "Upon receiving such report the tax commissioner shall ascertain and assess . . . the amount of taxable deposits of such institution in each county in which the institution maintained an office or offices for the receipt of deposits. Such amounts shall be assessed in the name of such financial institution excepting that the amounts of the taxable deposits wholly withdrawn from each such institution within the times mentioned in section 5411-2 of the General Code [that is, between the date of assessment and the bank's receipt of the notice of such date, or if no notice is received, the next January 1] and separately set forth in such report shall be subtracted from the amount of taxable deposits so assessed and separately assessed in the names of such respective depositors."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &#167;&#167; 5673-1 and 5673-2, see note 8, pp. 149-150, &lt;i&gt;supra.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[11]  See note 8, pp. 149-150, &lt;i&gt;supra.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[12]  Even so, if a comparable situation arose in connection with the tax on shareholders, the bank would have a right of reimbursement under the provisions of the Ohio statute. See note 8, pp. 149-150, &lt;i&gt;supra.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[13]  The Ohio court stated: "In our opinion, such a provision [an express right of reimbursement] is not necessary to enable such a financial institution to secure such reimbursement." 161 Ohio St., at 136, 118 N. E. 2d, at 659. It is clear that by this statement the court did not mean that an implied right of reimbursement existed under Ohio law, for it then went on to hold that "the financial institution, which pays the tax on [the depositors'] property interests in the corporation, will always be able to reimburse itself by reducing the ultimate value of the property interests of those who are the only ones who can have any claim to benefit from the ownership interest taxed." 161 Ohio St., at 137, 118 N. E. 2d, at 659-660. This is of course not reimbursement in any proper sense of the term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Decided May 16, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;John H. Skeen, Jr.&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Eugene M. Feinblatt.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Charles S. Bolster&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Seymour P. Edgerton, Robert Haydock, Jr.&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Theodore R. Dankmeyer.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petitioner, Boston Metals Company, brought this suit in admiralty against the steam vessel &lt;i&gt;Winding Gulf&lt;/i&gt; and her owners to recover for loss of its obsolete destroyer which sank after colliding with the &lt;i&gt;Winding Gulf.&lt;/i&gt; The collision occurred while the destroyer was being towed by the tug &lt;i&gt;Peter Moran;&lt;/i&gt; the destroyer itself was without power or crew. The owners of the &lt;i&gt;Winding Gulf&lt;/i&gt; filed a cross-libel against petitioner, charging that the collision was due to unseaworthiness of the destroyer. After hearings, the District Court found that the collision was due to negligent navigation by the &lt;i&gt;Winding Gulf,&lt;/i&gt; to inadequate lights on the destroyer and absence of a crew on the destroyer to keep its lights brightly burning. This absence of lights and crew the District Court found was &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*123&lt;/span&gt; the fault of the master of the tug &lt;i&gt;Peter Moran.&lt;/i&gt; The tug master's negligence, however, was imputed to the petitioner because of provisions in the towage contract that the master and crew of the tug would become the servants of the petitioner and that the towing company would not be responsible for their negligent towage. On this basis, the District Court entered a decree in favor of the cross-libellant against petitioner which resulted in dividing the damages equally between petitioner and respondents. 72 F. Supp. 50. The Court of Appeals affirmed on the same grounds. 209 F. 2d 410. We granted certiorari. 348 U. S. 811.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Bisso&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Inland Waterways Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; decided today, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 85, we held invalid a contract designed to shift responsibility for a towboat's negligence from the towboat to its innocent tow. That holding controls this case. For whatever this contract said, here as in the &lt;i&gt;Bisso&lt;/i&gt; case, the persons who conducted these towing operations were in fact acting as employees of the towing company, not as employees of the owner of the tow. Under these circumstances it was error to hold petitioner liable for negligence of the towing company's employees. Cf. &lt;i&gt;The Adriatic,&lt;/i&gt; 30 T. L. R. 699.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[For opinion of MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 95.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Release-from-liability clauses generally, and specifically with regard to towage contracts, are not to be applied to alter familiar rules visiting liability upon a tortfeasor for &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*124&lt;/span&gt; the consequences of his negligence, unless the clarity of the language used expresses such to be the understanding of the contracting parties. Even when such a clause undeniably alters the normal relationship between tug and tow as to some aspects of liability for negligence, it is not to be construed to impose every consequence of the tug's negligence upon the tow unless the clause decisively requires this result. See &lt;i&gt;The Devonshire and St. Winifred,&lt;/i&gt; [1913] P. 13; &lt;i&gt;The Richmond,&lt;/i&gt; 19 T. L. R. 29 (P. D.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue before us in this case is not the bare question whether the tow has contracted away its right to recover damages caused by the negligence of the tug. It is whether in addition the tow has undertaken to become directly liable to all third parties injured as a consequence of the negligence of the tug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the relevant clauses governing the towage here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"2. Tug services will be supplied upon the condition that all towing . . . of a vessel or craft of any character by a tug or tugs owned or employed by the Tug Company is done at the sole risk of such vessel or craft and of the owners, charterers or operators thereof, and that the Master and crew of such tug or tugs used in the said services become the servants of and identified with such vessel or craft and their owners, and that the Tug Company only undertakes to provide motive power.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"3. The Tug Company will not be responsible for the acts or defaults of the Master, or crew of such tug or tugs, or any of their servants or agents or else whosoever, nor for any damages, injuries, losses or delays from whatsoever cause arising that may occur either to such vessel or craft, or property or persons on board thereof, or to any other ship or vessel or property of any kind whether fixed or movable and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*125&lt;/span&gt; the Company shall be held harmless and indemnified by the Hirer against all such damages, injuries, losses and delays, and against all claims in respect thereof.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"4. Such exemption from liability shall apply regardless of whether such vessel or craft assists in the services with its own steam or power or in any other way, and irrespective of whether any employee of the Tug Company or the Master, or any of the crew of such tug or tugs is at the time of said services on board of such vessel or craft, or in command thereof.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"5. The foregoing conditions shall apply to any damages, injuries or loss from whatsoever cause arising that may occur to the vessel or craft requiring the tug or tugs or to any other vessel or craft, or to any person or property on board thereof, or to any other property whether fixed or movable, while such tug or tugs is or are in attendance upon . . . the vessel or craft . . . provided however that the said conditions shall not apply to loss or damage to the tug or tugs or to property on board the tug or tugs or to damages for personal injuries to or loss of life of members of the crews of the tug or tugs or persons on board thereof, unless such loss or damage or such damages for personal injuries or loss of life shall have been caused or contributed to by the fault or negligence of the vessel or craft requiring the tug or tugs."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the significance of these clauses to permit a third party injured by collision with the tow due to the negligence of the crew of the tug, to proceed directly against the owner of the tow by virtue of this clause?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Court refused to allow the third party to invoke the indemnity clause, but apparently held that the contract made the faults of the tug attributable to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*126&lt;/span&gt; the tow, imposing a vicarious liability upon its owner.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The Court of Appeals reasoned that since the tow had agreed to indemnify the tug against claims of third parties, the third party could proceed directly against the tow because "The libel was filed by the owner of the tow who had agreed to take the risk of the enterprise and pay any damages that might be incurred, and as was said by Judge Learned Hand in the Kookaburra, 2 Cir., 69 F. 2d 71, 73, `the admiralty, whose procedure is especially plastic, can skip the by-ways and head direct for the goal.' " 209 F. 2d 410, 414.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of the contractual provisions quoted, the owner of the tow would not be liable to the third party. &lt;i&gt;Sturgis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Boyer,&lt;/i&gt; 24 How. 110; &lt;i&gt;The Eugene F. Moran,&lt;/i&gt; 212 U. S. 466, 473. On the other hand, the tow did agree to indemnify the tug against liability in the circumstances here involved. But a promise to indemnify is a promise running to the indemnitee, here the tug, and is not ordinarily construed as a contract for the benefit of third parties. Nor does an agreement to hold another harmless against claims of third parties, if it conveys anything more than the term "indemnify," suggest that the contract was intended for the benefit of third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that the clause states that the members of the crew are to "become the servants of and identified with such vessel or craft" and that the tug will "not be responsible" for their acts. If in fact this were the relationship, the tow would be liable directly to third parties. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*127&lt;/span&gt; This was not the fact, however, and any liability of the tow to the &lt;i&gt;Winding Gulf&lt;/i&gt; can only be based upon the contractual language.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; But the history of towage and pilotage release-from-negligence clauses suggests that this terminology is merely an attempt to phrase a disclaimer of liability applicable to a towage service in the terms of the pilotage clause successfully invoked in &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dalzell Towing Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 287 U. S. 291. Like all attempts to describe desired legal consequences through use of inapposite concepts, the momentum of the symbolic concept may induce consequences beyond those which the true nature of the problem justifies.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Placed in its commercial and judicial context, the phraseology does not sufficiently indicate an agreement to undertake direct liability to third parties.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; There are good reasons why this should not be undertaken, among them the fact that in a suit to which the tug is not a party it may be difficult to obtain the full assistance of the tug in establishing non-liability or avoiding an unfairly larger recovery than might have been or subsequently is had against the tug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only remaining question then is whether the fact that the tow owner instituted this libel against the third &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*128&lt;/span&gt; party should permit the third party to assert as a defense, or affirmatively as a cross-libel in this case, the claim against the tug. The quotation cited by the Court of Appeals from &lt;i&gt;The Kookaburra&lt;/i&gt; is not in point, for there all parties were before the court, and the question was one of contribution. In such a situation circuity of action may be avoided without the danger of injury to any of the parties. But it is no defense to an action for negligence that a claim over against an absent third party exists, and the situation is not different because the absent third party in turn would, if held liable, be entitled to indemnity from the libellant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BURTON, whom MR. JUSTICE REED joins, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the validity of the agreement that "the Master and crew of such tug or tugs used in the said [towing] services become the servants of and identified with such [towed] vessel or craft and their owners," I would give that agreement full effect. To me, the agreement is sufficient to make the tow owners directly liable to third parties for the acts of the Master and crew who thus become their servants. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  72 F. Supp. 50. Respondent contends that in fact the District Court held that the owners of the tow were personally negligent in entering into the arrangement without taking steps to insure that the towage would be properly performed. There are some phrases in the opinion which tend to support this view, but on the whole it is not consistent with the course of reasoning of the District Judge. It was not the view taken by the Court of Appeals, and we would not be justified in adopting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Cf. &lt;i&gt;The Adriatic and The Wellington,&lt;/i&gt; 30 T. L. R. 699 (P. D.), in which the third party sued tug and tow, relying on a similar clause of the towage contract declaring the tug's crew to be servants of the tow. The tow was held not liable. In view of the English doctrine regarding contracts for the benefit of third parties, our problem of construction of the contract did not arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  See &lt;i&gt;Guy&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Donald,&lt;/i&gt; 203 U. S. 399, 406: "As long as the matter to be considered is debated in artificial terms there is danger of being led by a technical definition to apply a certain name, and then to deduce consequences which have no relation to the grounds on which the name was applied."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Note that the clause involved in &lt;i&gt;Bisso&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Inland Waterways Corp., ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 85, similar to the present one in most respects, expressly states that it is not to be construed to make the owner of the tow liable to third parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;No. 210.&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Argued March 1, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided May 16, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ralph S. Spritzer&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Burger&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Samuel D. Slade.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anthony V. Lynch, Jr.&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The respondent, Dauntless Towing Line, contracted to use two of its tugs in assisting the United States, petitioner here, move its steamship &lt;i&gt;Christopher Gale&lt;/i&gt; from Hoboken to a Brooklyn pier. The &lt;i&gt;Gale&lt;/i&gt; was to move under its own propelling power under guidance of one of respondent's tugboat captains or some other licensed &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*130&lt;/span&gt; pilot. The contract further provided that a tugboat captain or pilot going on board would become the "servant of the owners of the vessel assisted in respect to the giving of orders to any of the tugs furnished to or engaged in the assisting service and in respect to the handling of such vessel, and neither those furnishing the tugs and/or pilot nor the tugs, their owners, agents, or charterers shall be liable for any damage resulting therefrom." One of the respondent's tug captains went aboard the government vessel to pilot it in connection with the moving operation. The two tugs of respondent were at the time fastened to the &lt;i&gt;Gale&lt;/i&gt; by lines to help guide its movements. One of the tugs was crushed between the &lt;i&gt;Gale&lt;/i&gt; and a pier while attempting to carry out a maneuver under orders of the tug captain piloting the &lt;i&gt;Gale.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The respondent brought this suit in admiralty to recover damages from the United States alleging that damages to the tug were caused by negligent pilotage orders of the tug captain while temporarily acting as "servant" of the &lt;i&gt;Gale.&lt;/i&gt; After hearings the District Court found that the damages were caused by the pilot's negligence "in persisting in his attempt to enter the slip after he knew or should have known that he could not overcome the force of the wind and tide and keep the CHRISTOPHER GALE from sagging down on Pier 1." On this finding the District Court entered a decree requiring the United States to pay respondent for damages brought about by this negligence. This decree was entered over the Government's contention that the contract was invalid if construed as exempting respondent from liability for its own servant's negligence. 112 F. Supp. 730. Agreeing with the District Court's reasoning and decree, the Court of Appeals affirmed. 209 F. 2d 958. We granted certiorari to consider the meaning and validity of the pilotage &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*131&lt;/span&gt; clause, 348 U. S. 811, and at the same time granted certiorari in two other cases, today decided, which involve validity of contracts exempting towers from liability for negligent towage. &lt;i&gt;Bisso&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Inland Waterways Corp., ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 85; &lt;i&gt;Boston Metals Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;The Winding Gulf, ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 122.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sun Oil Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dalzell Towing Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 287 U. S. 291, involved the meaning and validity of a pilotage contract substantially the same as the one here. One of Dalzell's tug captains negligently piloted Sun Oil's vessel causing the boat to ground and suffer damages. Sun Oil sued Dalzell. The contract exempting Dalzell from liability for pilotage was pleaded as a defense. This Court held that the tug company could validly contract against being "liable for any damage" caused by the negligence of one of its captains in piloting Sun Oil's vessel and construed the contract there as having that effect. The question in this case, however, is whether the agreement of the ship being piloted to release the tug company from being "liable for any damage resulting" from negligent pilotage not only relieves the tug company from liability for damage, but allows it affirmatively to collect damages for injury to its own tug due to negligent pilotage by one of its tug captains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An agreement that one shall not be liable for negligence of a third person cannot easily be read as an agreement that one is entitled to collect damages for negligence of that third person. And there is no reason to stretch contractual language to force payment of damages under circumstances like these. A person supplying his own employees for use by another in a common undertaking cannot usually collect damages because of negligent work by the employee supplied. Clear contractual language might justify imposition of such liability. But the contractual &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*132&lt;/span&gt; language here does not meet such a test and we do not construe it as authorizing respondent to recover damages from petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BURTON, whom MR. JUSTICE REED joins, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pilotage clause agreed to by the parties herein states that&#151;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When the captain of any tug furnished to or engaged in the service of assisting a vessel which is making use of her own propelling power goes on board said vessel, or any other licensed pilot goes on board said vessel, &lt;i&gt;it is understood and agreed that said tugboat captain&lt;/i&gt; or licensed pilot &lt;i&gt;becomes the servant of the owners of the vessel assisted&lt;/i&gt; . . . ." (Italics supplied.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the above agreement, petitioner contracted to make the tug captain, while serving in this capacity, its servant. Recognizing the validity of this agreement, I would give full effect to its expressed purpose. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="prelims"&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Messrs. David Scribner, Frank J. Donner, New York City, for petitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Robert W. Ginnane, Washington, D.C., for respondent.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Chief Justice WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p1"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Petitioner was convicted for contempt of Congress under 2 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 192, 2 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 192, in the District Court of the District of Columbia. Section 192 provides for the punishment of any witness before a congressional committee 'who * * * refuses to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry * * *.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the conviction and remanded the case for a new trial.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; Claiming that the Court of Appeals should have directed an acquittal, petitioner applied to this Court for certiorari. We granted the writ because of the fundamental and recurrent character of the questions presented.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p2"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Pursuant to subpoena, petitioner appeared on August 10, 1949, before a subcommittee of the Committee on Un-American Activities of the House of Representatives. Petitioner was then a member and field representative of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America. Also subpoenaed to appear on that day were Thomas J. Fitzpatrick and Frank Panzino, two officers of the same union. At the outset of the hearings, counsel for the committee announced that the purpose of the investigation was to inquire into 'the question of Communist affiliation or association of certain members' of the union and 'the advisability of tightening present security requirements in industrial plants working on certain Government contracts.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; All three witnesses were asked questions concerning alleged membership in the Communist Party. All three declined to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p3"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Fitzpatrick was the first to be called to testify. He based his refusal to answer on 'the first and fifth Amendments' as well as 'the first amendment to the Constitution, supplemented by the fifth amendment.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="fn5_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; Immediately following Fitzpatrick's testimony, Panzino was called to the stand. In response to the identical questions put to Fitzpatrick, Panzino specifically adopted as his own the grounds relied upon by Fitzpatrick.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6" id="fn6_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; In addition, at one point in his testimony, Panzino stated that 'I think again, Mr. Chairman, under the fifth amendment, that is my own personal belief.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn7" id="fn7_ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; On the following day, petitioner, unaccompanied by counsel, was called to the stand and was also asked whether he had ever been a member of the Communist Party. Like Panzino before him, he declined to answer, specifically adopting as his own the grounds relied upon by Fitzpatrick.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn8" id="fn8_ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p4"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;On November 20, 1950, all three witnesses were indicted under &amp;#167; 192 for their refusals to answer.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn9" id="fn9_ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt; The three cases were tried before different judges, each sitting without a jury. Fitzpatrick and Panzino were acquitted. In Fitzpatrick's case, it was held that his references to 'the first and fifth amendments' and 'the first amendment to the Constitution, supplemented by the fifth amendment' constituted an adequate means of invoking the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn10" id="fn10_ref"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; Similarly, in Panzino's case, it was held that his reference to 'the fifth amendment' was sufficient to plead the privilege.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn11" id="fn11_ref"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt; In petitioner's case, however, the District Court held that a witness may not incorporate the position of another witness and rejected petitioner's defense based on the Self-Incrimination Clause.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn12" id="fn12_ref"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt; Petitioner was accordingly convicted and sentenced to a term of six months in jail and a fine of $500.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p5"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In reversing this conviction, the Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, held that 'No formula or specific term or expression is required' in order to plead the privilege and that a witness may adopt as his own a plea made by a previous witness.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn13" id="fn13_ref"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; Thus the Court of Appeals viewed the principal issue in the case as 'whether Fitzpatrick did or did not claim the privilege.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn14" id="fn14_ref"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt; On this issue, a majority of the Court of Appeals expressed no view. They agreed that a reversal without more would be in order if they 'were of clear opinion that Fitzpatrick, and therefore Quinn, did claim the privilege'. But they were 'not of that clear opinion.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn15" id="fn15_ref"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt; The Court of Appeals therefore ordered a new trial for determination of the issue by the District Court.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn16" id="fn16_ref"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt; The Court of Appeals also directed the District Court on retrial to determine whether petitioner 'was aware of the intention of his inquirer that answers were required despite his objections.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn17" id="fn17_ref"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt; In that regard, however, it rejected petitioner's contention that a witness cannot be convicted under &amp;#167; 192 for a refusal to answer unless the committee overruled his objections and specifically directed him to answer.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn18" id="fn18_ref"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p6"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It is from that decision that this Court granted certiorari.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p7"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;There can be no doubt as to the power of Congress, by itself or through its committees, to investigate matters and conditions relating to contemplated legislation. This power, deeply rooted in American and English institutions, is indeed co-extensive with the power to legislate. Without the power to investigate&amp;#8212;including of course the authority to compel testimony, either through its own processes&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn19" id="fn19_ref"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt; or through judicial trial&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn20" id="fn20_ref"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;Congress could be seriously handicapped in its efforts to exercise its constitutional function wisely and effectively.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn21" id="fn21_ref"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p8"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;But the power to investigate, broad as it may be, is also subject to recognized limitations. It cannot be used to inquire into private affairs unrelated to a valid legislative purpose.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn22" id="fn22_ref"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt; Nor does it extend to an area in which Congress is forbidden to legislate.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn23" id="fn23_ref"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt; Similarly, the power to investigate must not be confused with any of the powers of law enforcement; those powers are assigned under our Constitution to the Executive and the Judiciary.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn24" id="fn24_ref"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt; Still further limitations on the power to investigate are found in the specific individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights, such as the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination which is in issue here.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn25" id="fn25_ref"&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p9"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The privilege against self-incrimination is a right that was hardearned by our forefathers. The reasons for its inclusion in the Constitution&amp;#8212;and the necessities for its preservation&amp;#8212;are to be found in the lessons of history.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn26" id="fn26_ref"&gt;26&lt;/a&gt; As early as 1650, remembrance of the horror of Star Chamber procedings a decade before had firmly established the privilege in the common law of England. Transplanted to this country as part of our legal heritage, it soon made its way into various state constitutions and ultimately in 1791 into the federal Bill of Rights. The privilege, this Court has stated, 'was generally regarded then, as now, as a privilege of great value, a proection to the innocent though a shelter to the guilty, and a safeguard against heedless, unfounded, or tyrannical prosecutions.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn27" id="fn27_ref"&gt;27&lt;/a&gt; Coequally with our other constitutional guarantees, the Self-Incrimination Clause 'must be accorded liberal construction in favor of the right it was intended to secure.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn28" id="fn28_ref"&gt;28&lt;/a&gt; Such liberal construction is particularly warranted in a prosecution of a witness for a refusal to answer, since the respect normally accorded the privilege is then buttressed by the presumption of innocence accorded a defendant in a criminal trial. To apply the privilege narrowly or begrudgingly to treat it as an historical relic, at most merely to be tolerated is to ignore its development and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p10"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In the instant case petitioner was convicted for refusing to answer the committee's question as to his alleged membership in the Communist Party. Clearly an answer to the question might have tended to incriminate him.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn29" id="fn29_ref"&gt;29&lt;/a&gt; As a consequence, petitioner was entitled to claim the privilege. The principal issue here is whether or not he did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p11"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It is agreed by all that a claim of the privilege does not require any special combination of words.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn30" id="fn30_ref"&gt;30&lt;/a&gt; Plainly a witness need not have the skill of a lawyer to invoke the protection of the Self-Incrimination Clause. If an objection to a question is made in any language that a committee may reasonably be expected to understand as an attempt to invoke the privilege, it must be respected both by the committee and by a court in a prosecution under &amp;#167; 192.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p12"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Here petitioner, by adopting the grounds relied upon by Fitzpatrick, based his refusal to answer on 'the first and fifth Amendments' and 'the first amendment to the Constitution, supplemented by the fifth amendment.' The Government concedes&amp;#8212;as we think it must&amp;#8212;that a witness may invoke the privilege by stating 'I refuse to testify on the ground of the Fifth Amendment.' Surely, in popular parlance and even in legal literature, the term 'Fifth Amendment' in the context of our time is commonly regarded as being synonymous with the privilege against self-incrimination. The Government argues, however, that the references to the Fifth Amendment in the instant case were inadequate to invoke the privilege because Fitzpatrick's statements are more reasonably understood as invoking rights under the First Amendment. We find the Government's argument untenable. The mere fact that Fitzpatrick and petitioner also relied on the First Amendment does not preclude their reliance on the Fifth Amendment as well.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn31" id="fn31_ref"&gt;31&lt;/a&gt; If a witness urges two constitutional objections to a committee's line of questioning, he is not bound at his peril to choose between them. By pressing both objections, he does not lose a privilege which would have been valid if he had only relied on one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p13"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Government, moreover, apparently concedes that petitioner intended to invoke the privilege. In its brief the Government points out 'the probability that petitioner's ambiguous references to the Fifth Amendment * * * were phrased deliberately in such vague terms so as to enable petitioner * * * to obtain the benefit of the privilege without incurring the popular opprobrium which often attaches to its exercise.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn32" id="fn32_ref"&gt;32&lt;/a&gt; But the fact that a witness expresses his intention in vague terms is immaterial so long as the claim is sufficiently definite to apprise the committee of his intention. As everyone agrees, no ritualistic formula is necessary in order to invoke the privilege. In the instant case, Quinn's references to the Fifth Amendment were clearly sufficient to put the committee on notice of an apparent claim of the privilege. It then became incumbent on the committee either to accept the claim or to ask petitioner whether he was in fact invoking the privilege. Particularly is this so if it is true, as the Government contends, that petitioner feared the stigma that might result from a forthright claim of his constitutional right to refuse to testify. It is precisely at such times&amp;#8212;when the privilege is under attack by those who wrongly conceive of it as merely a shield for the guilty&amp;#8212;that governmental bodies must be most scrupulous in protecting its exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p14"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This ruling by no means leaves a congressional committee defenseless at the hands of a scheming witness intent on deception. When a witness declines to answer a question because of constitutional objections and the language used is not free from doubt, the way is always open for the committee to inquire into the nature of the claim before making a ruling. If the witness unequivocally and intelligently waives any objection based on the Self-Incrimination Clause, or if the witness refuses a committee request to state whether he relies on the Self-Incrimination Clause, he cannot later invoke its protection in a prosecution for contempt for refusing to answer that question. Here the committee made no attempt to have petitioner particularize his objection. Under these circumstances, we must hold that petitioner's references to the Fifth Amendment were sufficient to invoke the privilege and that the court below erred in failing to direct a judgment of acquittal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;II.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p15"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;There is yet a second ground for our decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p16"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Section 192, like the ordinary federal criminal statute, requires a criminal intent&amp;#8212;in this instance, a deliberate, intentional refusal to answer.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn33" id="fn33_ref"&gt;33&lt;/a&gt; This element of the offense, like any other, must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Petitioner contends that such proof was not, and cannot be, made in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p17"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Clearly not every refusal to answer a question propounded by a congressional committee subjects a witness to prosecution under &amp;#167; 192. Thus if he raises an objection to a certain question &amp;#8212;for example, lack of pertinency or the privilege against self-incrimination&amp;#8212;the committee may sustain the objection and abandon the question, even though the objection might actually be without merit. In such an instance, the witness' refusal to answer is not contumacious, for there is lacking the requisite criminal intent. Or the committee may disallow the objection and thus give the witness the choice of answering or not. Given such a choice, the witness may recede from his position and answer the question. And if he does not then answer, it may fairly be said that the foundation has been laid for a finding of criminal intent to violate &amp;#167; 192. In short, unless the witness is clearly apprised that the committee demands his answer notwithstanding his objections, there can be no conviction under &amp;#167; 192 for refusal to answer that question.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn34" id="fn34_ref"&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p18"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Was petitioner so apprised here? At no time did the committee specifically overrule his objection based on the Fifth Amendment; nor did the committee indicate its overruling of the objection by specifically directing petitioner to answer. In the absence of such committee action, petitioner was never confronted with a clear-cut choice between compliance and noncompliance, between answering the question and risking prosecution for contempt. At best he was left to guess whether or not the committee had accepted his objection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p19"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This ambiguity in the committee's position is apparent from the transcript of the hearing.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn35" id="fn35_ref"&gt;35&lt;/a&gt; Immediately after petitioner stated that he was adopting Fitzpatrick's objection, the committee chairman asked petitioner: '* * * will you now answer the question whether you are now or ever have been a member of the Communist Party, or do you decline to answer?' In response to this, petitioner stated for the first time that he would not answer. He said: 'I decline to discuss with the committee questions of that nature.' Committee counsel thereupon stated that further questioning 'relating to those matters' was 'not necessary' and proceeded upon a new line of inquiry. There is nothing in this colloquy from which petitioner could have determined with a reasonable degree of certainty that the committee demanded his answer despie his objection. Rather, the colloquy is wholly consistent with the hypothesis that the committee had in fact acquiesced in his objection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p20"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Our view that a clear disposition of the witness' objection is a prerequisite to prosecution for contempt is supported by long-standing tradition here and in other English-speaking nations.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn36" id="fn36_ref"&gt;36&lt;/a&gt; In this country the tradition has been uniformly recognized in the procedure of both state and federal courts.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn37" id="fn37_ref"&gt;37&lt;/a&gt; It is further reflected in the practice of congressional committees prior to the enactment of &amp;#167; 192 in 1857; a specific direction to answer was the means then used to apprise a witness of the overruling of his objection.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn38" id="fn38_ref"&gt;38&lt;/a&gt; Against this background &amp;#167; 192 became law.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn39" id="fn39_ref"&gt;39&lt;/a&gt; No relaxation of the safeguards afforded a witness was contemplated by its sponsors. In explaining the bill in the House, Congressman Davis expressly stated that committee powers were not increased, that no added burden was placed upon the witness and that a 'mere substitution' of a judicial proceeding for punishment at the bar of Congress was intended.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn40" id="fn40_ref"&gt;40&lt;/a&gt; The reason for enacting &amp;#167; 192 went to the punishment and not the offense. It was recognized that the power of Congress to deal with a contemnor by its own processes did not extend beyond the life of any session.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn41" id="fn41_ref"&gt;41&lt;/a&gt; By making contempt of Congress a crime, a fixed term of imprisonment was substituted for variable periods of congressional custody dependent upon the fortuity of whether the contemnor had been called to testify near the beginning or the end of a session.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn42" id="fn42_ref"&gt;42&lt;/a&gt; But there is nothing to indicate that this change in the mode of punishment affected in any way the well-established elements of contempt of Congress. Since the enactment of &amp;#167; 192, the practice of specifically directing a recalcitrant witness to answer has continued to prevail.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn43" id="fn43_ref"&gt;43&lt;/a&gt; In fact, the very committee involved here, the House Un-American Activities Committee, originally followed this practice&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn44" id="fn44_ref"&gt;44&lt;/a&gt; and recently resumed it.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn45" id="fn45_ref"&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p21"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Giving a witness a fair apprisal of the committee's ruling on an objection recognizes the legitimate interests of both the witness and the committee. Just as the witness need not use any particular form of words to present his objection, so also the committee is not required to resort to any fixed verbal formula to indicate its disposition of the objection. So long as the witness is not forced to guess the committee's ruling, he has no cause to complain. And adherence to this traditional practice can neither inflict hardship upon the committee nor abridge the proper scope of legislative investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;III.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p22"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Petitioner also attacks his conviction on grounds involving novel constitutional issues. He contends that the House Resolution authorizing the committee's operations is invalid under the First Amendment. In addition, petitioner contends that the trial court erred in denying a hearing on the alleged bias of the indicting grand jury. Our disposition of the case makes it unnecessary to pass on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p23"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The judgment below is reversed and the case remanded to the District Court with directions to enter a judgment of acquittal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p24"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p25"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Justice HARLAN, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p26"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;I agree with the result reached by the Court in this case. But I must dissent from the holding made in part II of the majority opinion. The reasons for my position are stated in part II of my dissenting opinion in the Emspak case, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xiC/julius-emspak-petitioner-v-united-states-of/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;349&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;190&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 75 S.Ct. 687. I consider those reasons equally applicable to what is shown by the record in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p27"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Justice REED, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p28"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Court in these two cases refuses to punish petitioners, witnesses before the Committee on Un-American Activities of the House of Representatives, for refusal to answer certain pertinent questions. Such refusal is declared to be a misdemeanor by 2 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 192, 2 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 192.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p29"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The separate opinions are based on the conclusion that the petitioners each properly claimed for himself the privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. The Court holds that questions concerning association with known communists or membership in the Party asked witnesses holding prominent positions in a local union, under investigation for communist infiltration directed at national security, might reasonably be feared as incriminatory by the witnesses.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1-1" id="fn1-1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; For these cases I make that assumption, too. In both the cases, the Court directs remand to the trial court with directions to acquit. This disposition of the charges excludes any factual issues for decision by the trial court as to whether the witnesses did or did not claim their privilege. It decides that, as a matter of law, the petitioners claimed their privilege by the words used by them in answer to the questions propounded by the Committee. Since the indictments contained numerous counts covering many questions asked and the evidence showed varying reasons for not answering, the conclusion that privilege was claimed blankets all questions. Since the sentences were less than the maximum penalty for one count, if the Court's determination is wrong as to any one question, its present judgments are wrong.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2-1" id="fn2-1_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; Normally the issue as to whether a claim of privilege was made would be a matter of fact for the trial court if reasonable men might reach either conclusion. See the discussion below in the opinion of Judge Prettyman in Quinn v. United States, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 344, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/cadc/2bLW/quinn-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;203&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 24, and of Judge Bazelon at pages 26 and 38. None of the judges of the Court of Appeals suggested approval of such action as this Court now takes in directing acquittal. See also Emspak v. United States, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 378, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/cadc/2bLY/emspak-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;203&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;54&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, dissent 60. This Court at least should have followed that course here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p30"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;These sweeping decisions affect the conduct of all congressional inquiries and all courts, for from the opinions there emerges a legally enforceable rule for handling hearings or prosecutions when questions raise for the witness a problem of self-incrimination. The Court, Quinn opinion, 75 S.Ct. 674, requires the interrogator, once the witness' claim though 'vague * * * is sufficiently definite to apprise the committee of his intention' to claim his privilege, 'either to accept the claim or to ask petitioner whether he was in fact invoking the privilege.' Although this phrasing, particularly the last clause, carries for me probabilities of uncertainties in future applications that former decisions avoided,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3-1" id="fn3-1_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; it is accepted for this case as the governing rule. My conclusion is that neither petitioner here apprised the Committee that he was claiming his privilege. As shown by the cases just cited, the privilege is personal to the witness. The reach of questions into matters that might lead to his prosecution for crime may be known only to him. Therefore the witness has the burden of doing something more than suggesting a question might incriminate him. At least, in the words of the Court, he must 'apprise the committee of his intention' to claim his privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p31"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The purpose of having witnesses is to furnish to proper interrogators, subject to objections for materiality or the use of coercion, the actual facts they seek. Legislation can best be drafted and cases tried most fairly only when all pertinent facts are made available to those charged with legislation or maintenance of the peace. However, the Congress in the first series of Amendments to the Constitution wrote an exception to this duty in the instance where an answer would compel a person to be a witness against himself in a criminal case. In that situation, on a valid claim of privilege against self-incrimination, the witness may be excused from answering.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4-1" id="fn4-1_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; That exception should neither be shriveled nor bloated. It is designed to excuse the guilty and the innocent alike from testifying when prosecution may reasonably be feared from compelled disclosures. The importance of preserving the right to require evidence, except when a witness definitely apprises the interrogating body of a valid claim of privilege, leads us to dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class="center"&gt;I. Claim of Privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p32"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Court finds from the record before the Committee an apprisal by petitioners which the Committee should have understood as a claim of privilege against self-incrimination. In examining the record for this purpose, all the pertinent testimony must be considered and evaluated in the light of the purpose and abilities of the petitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p33"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;During an active period of national rearmament this Committee was investigating subversive and security situations in the sensitive electronic industry with a view to possible legislation.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5-1" id="fn5-1_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; The recalcitrant witnesses held important positions in the field. Mr. Quinn was a field organizer of the International Union of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers. Mr. Emspak was its General Secretary. The third witness, who is not a petitioner but whose testimony is hereafter referred to, was Mr. Fitzpatrick, chief steward of the Westinghouse Corporation local. There is nothing to indicate that the witnesses had mentalities of a quality less than one would expect from experienced officials holding such responsible positions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p34"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It will be observed from their testimony, however, that in avoiding direct answers to specific questions each one engaged in exercises in dialectics that always fell short of advising the Committee of any intention to claim his privilege. In view of the ease with which a claim can be made by any layman, the availability of personal lawyers for these witnesses and the careful avoidance of any such statement as, 'I decline to answer on the ground of possible self-incrimination,' I cannot hold that these witnesses evidenced by their testimony an intention to claim privilege. The fact that a claim of privilege would subject the witnesses to criticism in some quarters, of course, has no bearing upon the necessity to assert one's rights. This is emphasized by the fact that long ago this Court declared that no moral turpitude is involved in refusing to answer under the protection of the privilege.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6-1" id="fn6-1_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p35"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;While the trial and appellate courts each had only a printed record of the testimony, one group, the subcommittees themselves, had the best opportunity to appraise disinterestedly the fact of whether Messrs. Quinn and Emspak claimed the privilege. The questions and answers were both asked by the counsel and answered by the witnesses in the hearing of the Committee. In citations of Quinn and Emspak to the House for contempt, the Committee certified that the refusal of each 'to answer the aforesaid questions deprived your committee of necessary and pertinent testimony * * *.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn7-1" id="fn7-1_ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; It can hardly be contended that the Committee did not know a claim of privilege against answering incriminating questions would have excused the witnesses from answering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p36"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;36&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In view of the basis of the Court's decision made on its own examination and appraisal of the record, we must necessarily set out for discussion much of the testimony to determine whether the witnesses claimed the privilege.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn8-1" id="fn8-1_ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; The pertinent evidence follows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p37"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;37&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;After testifying at some length, the petitioner was asked: 'Mr. Emspak, are you acquainted with Joseph Persily?' Petitioner did not answer the question but made the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p38"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;38&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. Mr. Chairman, I would like to say something at      this point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p39"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;39&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Moulder. You mean in response to the question?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. I will answer the question; yes, in response to      the question and as a statement of position.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;41&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'What I say revolves around two points, one organizationally      and another as an individual. Organizationally, my job as an      officer of this union is to represent the interest of the      membership as they determine it at the annual conventions and      at other means they have of getting together and expressing      themselves. My job is to administer that aspect to the best      of my ability, using one very simple measuring stick, and      that is: Does a given policy or action contribute to the      well-being of the membership, individually and collectively?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'As an individual I would like to say one thing, and that is      this: The line of questioning that counsel is developing now      is a line that has been used on numerous occasions by this      committee and other congressional committees in an attempt to      harass the union, its leadership, and its members. It is a      line of questioning that goes against my grain as an      American. I was born in this country. Everything I am&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Moulder. How do you spell that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p52"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;52&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Tavenner. P-e-r-s-i-l-y.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="num" id="p53"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. Because I have a stake in this country&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p54"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;54&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Moulder. You are not answering the question. He asked      you if you are acquainted with this man.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Moulder. If you have any explanation to make you will be      permitted to do so after you answer the question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;59&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. Because of my interest in what is going on these      days, because of the activities of this committee&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p60"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Moulder. Are you going to answer the question? 'Mr. Emspak. Because of the hysteria, I think it is my           duty to endeavor to protect the rights guaranteed under           the Constitution, primarily the first amendment,           supplemented by the fifth. This committee will corrupt           those rights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p61"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;61&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Moulder. Do you think it corrupts you to answer the      question?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p62"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;62&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. I certainly do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p63"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;63&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Moulder. Why does it corrupt you?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="num" id="p64"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. Your activities are designed to harm the working      people of this country. Every action this committee has ever      taken has done that. You interfered last summer in the      election of a local union at the request of a priest. You      know that. You dragged down the prestige of this country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p65"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;65&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;67&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Moulder. And your statements are preposterous. The      purpose of this committee is to expose communism as it exists      in this country. What is the question?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p68"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;68&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;69&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. For the reasons I stated before, I answered it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p70"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;70&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Moulder. Then you refuse to answer the question?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p71"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;71&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. No. I answered it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;73&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. I answered the question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;74&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Tavenner. Your replies are a refusal to comply with the      request to answer it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p75"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;75&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'(Witness confers with his counsel.) 'Mr. Moulder. The record will reveal that you have not           answered the question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;76&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. I have answered it to the best of my ability      under the circumstances.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p77"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;77&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In answer to subsequent questions, the petitioner simply referred to his prior answer. Later on, the following statements were made:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p78"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;78&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. Mr. Chairman, on these questions, which are all      essentially the same, of course, when this hearing was      announced according to the press reports, at least, it was      announced because this committee presumably was interested in      finding out things with reference to individuals in our      organization by using whatever means it has at its disposal,      and for the purpose of trying to perhaps frame people for      possible criminal prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p79"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;79&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'I don't see how or why any individual should be subjected to      that kind of questioning here if he is going to maintain, you      know, his feelings on these questions, and I tried to express      the feeling before when you interrupted me. I just don't      intend, as I said then, to be a party to any kangaroo court      proceedings of this committee or any other congressional      committee. I think I have the right to reserve whatever      rights I have in that respect to whatever appropriate bodies      may be set up to deal with questions that come up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p80"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Moulder. Do you mean to say you have people in your      organization who have information that would subject you to      criminal prosecution?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p81"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;81&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. No; I don't, Mr. Chairman. As a basic      proposition&amp;#8212;and it has worked over the years and over the      last few months as far as this committee is concerned&amp;#8212;a slick      job&amp;#8212; 'Mr. Moulder. Do you know them or not?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p82"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;82&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. That does not concern this committee at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p83"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;83&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Moulder. Is it your feeling that to reveal your      knowledge of them would subject you to criminal prosecution?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p84"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;84&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. No. I don't think this committee has a right to      pry into my associations. That is my own position.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p85"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;85&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;No more of the record is printed, as the excerpt shows the exchange between the Committee and petitioner upon which Count I of the indictment and the constitutional issues arising thereunder are based. This related to his acquaintanceship with Joseph Persily, a man who had been listed, according to a stipulation, as a person named as an official 'of the UERMWA with Communist or Communist Front Affiliations.' Nothing more favorable to petitioner's position appears on the questions examined or any other question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p86"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;86&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;As the Emspak case offers for me a clear example of failure to claim his privilege, I think it better not to encumber this opinion unnecessarily with quotations from the Quinn case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p87"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;87&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In the Quinn case, the witness adopted in its entirety the testimony of a former witness, Mr. Thomas J. Fitzpatrick, chief steward of Local No. 601, United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America. Mr. Quinn's testimony establishing his reliance on Mr. Fitzpatrick's evidence will be found in this Court's opinion in the Quinn case, supra, note 8, 75 S.Ct. 671. The hearing opened with a declaration by Mr. Fitzpatrick of minority rights to secrecy as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p88"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;88&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'The Constitution of this country provides certain protection      for minorities and gives the privilege for people to speak      and think as they feel that they should and want to. It also gives the privilege that people      can have opinions or beliefs that may be unpopular. In my      opinion, it gives them the right to hold those opinions      secret if they so desire. This is a protection of the first      amendment to the Constitution, supplemented by the fifth      amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p89"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;89&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Wood. What is?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p90"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;90&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Fitzpatrick. The right of the people guaranteed by the      Constitution.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p91"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;91&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This certainly indicated no claim of the privilege against self-incrimination. Mr. Fitzpatrick was then asked: 'Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?' After fencing with the Committee about prying into his mind, he said:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p92"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;92&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Fitzpatrick. I will answer the question. The      Constitution guarantees the right to me and every other      citizen to have beliefs, whether they are popular or      unpopular, and to keep them to themselves if they see fit,      and I have no intention of being a party to weakening or      destroying that protection in the Constitution. I feel when I      take this position that I am one of the real Americans, and      not like some of the phonies who appear here.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p93"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;93&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Later on he was asked whether he had asked a Mr. Copeland to sign an application for membership in a Communist organization. In answer to that question this occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p94"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;94&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Fitzpatrick. Mr. Chairman, do I have to give you my      answer again?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p95"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;95&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Wood. I just want to know whether you did that one      thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p96"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;96&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Fitzpatrick. I say if I did or if I did not, regardless      of what I did, it is not the affair of this committee to pry      into this kind of action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p97"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;97&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Wood. And for that reason do you decline to answer           the question?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p98"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;98&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Fitzpatrick. I stand on the protection of the      Constitution, the first and fifth Amendments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p99"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;99&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Wood. And for those reasons decline to answer the      question further?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p100"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Fitzpatrick. I have answered the question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p101"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;101&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Wood. I say, do you decline to answer it further?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p102"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;102&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Fitzpatrick. I have no further comment on it.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p103"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;103&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The two references to the First and Fifth Amendments are the only phrases in the whole examination that could be thought to refer to a claim of immunity against self-incrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p104"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;104&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;From these vague statements of Messrs. Quinn and Emspak the Court draws the conclusion that they were sufficient to apprise the Committee of the witnesses' intention to claim the privilege against self-incrimination. The Court finds support for its theory of 'intention' to claim privilege from a statement in the Government's brief in the Quinn case set out below.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn9-1" id="fn9-1_ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt; With all respect, I fail to see any concession by the Government of evidence that should apprise the Committee of a claim of privilege against self-incrimination. The first sentence of the quotation from the brief emphatically denies the Court's assumption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p105"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;105&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;What the records show to me is a calculated effort by Messrs. Quinn, Emspak and Fitzpatrick to hinder and delay a congressional committee in its effort to bring out facts in order to determine whether or not to undertake legislation. Such quibbling evades the basis for an understanding of the attitude of the witness as to privilege. It does not apprise the Committee of the claim of privilege and should not be held permissible. Factual testimony is the means for the ascertainment of truth in legally organized inquiries. Silence brings the proceedings to a dead end. The burden is on the witness to advise his interrogators of a claim to privilege in understandable terms.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn10-1" id="fn10-1_ref"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; In the context of this testimony, the adoption by Mr. Quinn of Mr. Fitzpatrick's reference to the First and Fifth Amendments smacks strongly of a 'due process' Fifth Amendment claim. Mr. Fitzpatrick had been speaking of his right of privacy, speech and association, not of the privilege against self-incrimination. He then added:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p106"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;106&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Chairman, if you want to ask me questions about my      actions of loyalty, question my loyalty, you have a right to      do so and I will answer them. So far as my political      opinions, I have stated my position on that. You are asking      the same question in a different way. But if my memory is      right, there was no such thing as a Communist Party when that      affidavit is supposed to have been.' The same attitude shows through Mr. Emspak's testimony. In addition there was a direct refusal by Mr. Emspak to claim privilege. See 75 S.Ct. 681, 682, supra.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p107"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;107&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Court suggests that this should not be construed as a waiver of the claim and cites Smith v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x7K/smith-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;337&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;137&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 151, 69 S.Ct. 1000, 1007, 93 L.Ed. 1264. I do not think the Smith case apposite. In that case there had been a clear claim of privilege for immunity. We held that required a definite, unambiguous waiver. Here there was, in my view, no claim of privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p108"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;108&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The opinion of the trial court, printed only in the record, pp. 224&amp;#8212;227, holds 'The defendant failed to assert (the privilege).' Six of the nine members of the Court of Appeals held that Emspak had not claimed. Three did not reach that issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p109"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;109&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;I concur with the Court in its assertions of the value of the self-incrimination clause&amp;#8212;that it may be used as a shield by guilty and innocent alike&amp;#8212;and that it should be construed liberally as it has been to cover more than the literal reading of the phrase 'No person * * * shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself' would suggest.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn11-1" id="fn11-1_ref"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt; This sympathetic attitude toward the clause should not lead us to intrude our ideas of propriety into the conduct of congressional hearings. The rule laid down by the Court today merely adds another means for interference and delay in investigations and trials, without adding to the protecton of the constitutional right of freedom from self-incrimination. This is contrary to the policy of Congress to get information from witnesses even with a claim of immunity, through the Compulsory Testimony Act of August 20, 1954, 68 Stat. 745, 18 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 3486 and note preceding &amp;#167; 3481.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p110"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;110&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;II. Direction to Answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p111"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;111&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Court advances a second ground in the Quinn and Emspak cases for its direction that the District Court enter a judgment of acquittal. This is that a deliberate intent to refuse to answer the Committee's questions is required for the judgment of contempt. The Court explains, Quinn case, 75 S.Ct. 675, that intent may be implied only when the witness is 'clearly apprised that the Committee demands his answer notwithstanding his objections,' and, Emspak case, 75 S.Ct. 694 'without such apprisal, there is lacking the element of deliberateness necessary for a conviction under &amp;#167; 192 for a refusal to answer.' The Court concludes that the witness was not 'specifically' directed to answer, or otherwise informed as to the disposition of his objections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p112"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;112&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Court must admit, as it does, Quinn Opinion, 75 S.Ct. 673, that no particular form of words is required. On the other hand, I must admit that a witness must be clearly apprised that his claim of the freedom from an obligation to answer is not accepted by the interrogator.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn12-1" id="fn12-1_ref"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt; I agree that the offense punishable under the statute is a deliberate, intentional refusal not an inadvertence, accident or misunderstanding.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn13-1" id="fn13-1_ref"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; Good faith in refusing to answer, however, is no defense so long as the refusal is intentional, deliberate. Sinclair v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/w9w/sinclair-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;279&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;263&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 299, 49 S.Ct. 268, 274, 73 L.Ed. 692, points out that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p113"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;113&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'The gist of the offense is refusal to answer pertinent      questions. * * * Intentional violation is sufficient to      constitute guilt.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p114"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;114&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;United States v. Murdock, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wgf/united-states-v-murdock/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;284&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;141&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 52 S.Ct. 63, 76 L.Ed. 210, involved a statute very similar to the one here involved. In that case, Murdock had been called to testify before an Internal Revenue Agent and refused to answer certain questions on the ground that he might be incriminated under state law. We said in that case:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p115"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;115&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'While undoubtedly the right of a witness to refuse to answer      lest he incriminate himself may be tested in proceedings to      compel answer, there is no support for the contention that      there must be such a determination of that question before      prosecution for the willful failure so denounced. By the very      terms of the definition the offense is complete at the time      of such failure.' 284 U.S., at page 148, 52 S.Ct., at page      64.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p116"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;116&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;There was no direction to answer in either case. While the point was not raised, their holding as to what establishes the offense does not include a specific direction to answer as one of the elements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p117"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;117&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;While the Court held in Sinclair that deliberate refusal was all that was required to consummate the offense under 2 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 192, 2 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 192, at the same time we were at pains to point out 'There was no misapprehension' on the part of the witness 'as to what was called for.' 279 U.S. at page 299, 49 S.Ct. at page 274. It is because the refusal must be intentional, that the witness must know that his excuses for not answering have not been accepted by the Committee. When a witness interposes objections to testifying which are not frivolous, it is difficult to say he intentionally refused to answer when the interrogation continues without pause to some other question. I agree that the Committee cannot, in fairness to the witness, lull him into thinking that his refusal to answer is acceptable and then cite him for contempt. Refusal under such circumstances would not be deliberate. However, specific direction to answer is not necessary; only intentional refusal is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p118"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;118&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Court suggests, note 36, Quinn case, 75 S.Ct. 676, that congressional committees follow the practice of other legislative bodies and determine first the validity of the witness' reason for failure to answer and then direct him to answer. The defect in that analogy is that the Court seems to assume in its note a formal vote and a specific direction to answer. I think such a specific direction is inconsistent with its admission that no ritualistic formula is required. 75 S.Ct. 677. No provision of the statute, nor of any rule of Congress is cited by the Court to support a requirement of specific direction. The Court of Appeals held direction to answer unnecessary so long as the witness knew that the Committee had not acceded to his refusal.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn14-1" id="fn14-1_ref"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt; As I stated above, in my view it is sufficient if the witness knows his excuses are not acceptable to the Committee and that he is required to answer. Whether or not the witnesses knew this in these two cases is the question on this second point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p119"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;119&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Court holds that the witnesses did plead the privilege and were not advised that the Committee refused to accept their pleas. I disagree. After Mr. Quinn had adopted Mr. Fitzpatrick's words as his own method of refusing to answer the question as heretofore discussed, it will be seen that Mr. Wood, a Committee member, said to Mr. Quinn:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p120"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;120&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Wood. You have stated your position. Having enunciated      your sentiments and your position, will you now answer the      question whether you are now or ever have been a member of      the Communist Party, or do you decline to answer?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p121"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;121&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Quinn. I decline to discuss with the committee questions      of that nature.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p122"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;122&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This, I think advised Mr. Quinn that the Committee refused to accept his reply as a satisfactory excuse and required him to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p123"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;I think, too, that Mr. Emspak was advised his answer was not accepted and that he was required to proceed. When he was asked repeatedly as to whether he was acquainted with Joseph Persily, he said again:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p124"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;124&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. For the reasons I stated before, I answered it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p125"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;125&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Moulder. Then you refuse to answer the question?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p126"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;126&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. No. I answered it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p127"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;127&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Tavenner. Are you or are you not acquainted with Joseph      Persily?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p128"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;128&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. I answered the question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p129"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;129&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Tavenner. Your replies are a refusal to comply with the      request to answer it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p130"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;130&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'(Witness confers with his counsel.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p131"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;131&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Moulder. The record will reveal that you have not      answered the question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p132"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;132&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. I have answered it to the best of my ability      under the circumstances.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p133"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;133&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;On continued questioning as to Mr. Persily, he continued, 'I will give the same answer.' I cannot but conclude, as did the lower courts, that the witness Emspak was adequately informed that his objections were refused and that he must answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p134"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;134&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Court directs acquittal of both petitioners on the grounds of claim of privilege and failure to specifically overrule their objections or direct them to answer. I disagree with both grounds. Confining expression of my views to those issues, I dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p135"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;135&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Justice MINTON joins in so much of this opinion as applies to Emspak v. United States.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Quinn. I would like to make a statement along the lines that Mr. Fitzpatrick made yesterday in regard to a question of that nature. I feel that the political beliefs, opinions, and associations of the American people can be held secret if they so desire.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Wood. And for those reasons do you decline to answer that question?&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Wood. Did you hear his statement yesterday?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Quinn. Yes; I did.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Wood. Do you support it in its entirety?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Quinn. In its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Wood. Is there anything else you want to add to it?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Quinn. No; I don't.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Wood. Will you accept it as the expression of your views, then?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Quinn. You may. I may add I feel I have no other choice in this matter, because the defense of the Constitution, I hold sacred. I don't feel I am hiding behind the Constitution, but in this case I am standing before it, defending it, as small as I am.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Wood. Having made that statement and subscribed to the sentiments expressed by the witness yesterday to whom you referred, will you now answer the question whether you are now or have ever been a member of the Communist Party?&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Wood. You have stated your position. Having enunciated your sentiments and your position, will you now answer the question whether you are now or ever have been a member of the Communist Party, or do you decline to answer?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Quinn. I decline to discuss with the committee questions of that nature.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Wood. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Tavenner. I believe in the light of that answer it is not necessary to ask you any further questions relating to those matters, so I will ask you this: Do you know Mr. James J. Matles?&lt;/p&gt;

Kamp, D.C.D.C., 102 F.Supp. 757, 759: 'Committees of Congress must conduct examinations in such a manner that it is clear to the witness that the Committee recognizes him as being in default, and anything short of a clear cut default on the part of the witness will not sustain a conviction for contempt of Congress. The transcript of the defendant Kamp's testimony fails to disclose such a clear cut default. The witness is not required to enter into a guessing game when called upon to appear before a committee. The burden is upon the presiding member to make clear the directions of the committee, to consider any reasonable explanations given by the witness, and then to rule on the witness' response.' The defendant was accordingly acquitted.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On similar grounds, an acquittal was directed in United States v. Browder, unreported, Criminal No. 1784&amp;#8212;50 (D.D.C.).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Recalcitrant witnesses before investigating committees of the British House of Commons have traditionally been apprised of the disposition of their objections and given subsequent opportunity to respond before being subjected to the contempt power of the legislature. The practice has been as follows: The committee reports the failure to answer to the House. The witness is questioned about the cause of the refusal to answer before the Bar of the House. The House then votes on the validity of the objection. If the claim is rejected, the witness is specifically directed to answer. Only after a subsequent refusal is punishment imposed. See 88 Journals of the House of Commons 212, 218 (Case of Elizabeth Robinson before Select Committee on Liverpool Bribery, 1833); 90 Journals of the House of Commons 501, 504, and 29 Hans.Deb., 3d Ser. 1249, 1279&amp;#8212;1288 (Case of William Prentice before Select Committee on Great Yarmouth Bribery, 1835); 90 Journals of the House of Commons 564, 571, 575 (Case of Lieutenant Colonel Fairman before Select Committee on the Orange Lodges, 1835); 152 Journals of the House of Commons 661, 365 (Case of John Kirkwood before Select Committee on Money Lending, 1897).&lt;/p&gt;

Simonton be haled before the bar of the House of Representatives for refusing to answer a question put to him by a duly-authorized committee of that body. Cong. Globe, 34th Cong., 3d Sess. 403&amp;#8212;404 (1857). The resolution states in part:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'The committee were impressed with the materiality of the testimony withheld by the witness, as it embraced the letter and spirit of the inquiry directed by the House to be made, but were anxious to avoid any controversy with the witness. They consequently waived the interrogatory that day, to give the witness time for reflection on the consequences of his refusal, and to afford him an opportunity to look into the law and the practice of the House in such cases, notifying him that he would, om some subsequent day, be recalled. This was the 15th of January instant. On Tuesday, the 20th instant, the said J. W. Simonton was recalled, and the identical question first referred to was again propounded, after due notice to him that if he declined the committee would feel constrained to report his declination to the House, and ask that body to enforce all its powers in the premises to compel a full and complete response.'

        &lt;p&gt;'Moreover, we feel bound to point out the probability that petitioner's ambiguous references to the Fifth Amendment (and those of the petitioner Emspak in No. 9 (75 S.Ct. 687)), which he now contends constituted a claim of privilege, were phrased deliberately in such vague terms so as to enable petitioner (and Emspak) to obtain the benefit of the privilege without incurring the popular opprobrium which often attaches to its exercise. This suggestion is not based merely upon the obvious fact that it would have been extremely easy for petitioner to have informed the Committee that answers to its questions might incriminate or endanger him. It is also based upon facts of record, and matters appropriate for judicial notice, which reveal that petitioner (and Fitzpatrick and Emspak) had compelling and immediate reasons to refrain from making any public statements from which it might be inferred, properly or not, that they were Communists or Communist sympathizers.'

&lt;center&gt;Decided May 23, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Marvin E. Frankel&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*281&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Assistant Attorney General Olney, Beatrice Rosenberg&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;J. F. Bishop.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jack Wasserman&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are called upon in this case to remove ambiguities from a previous opinion which, while clear enough to the trial court, appears to have conveyed a triplicity of meaning to the Court of Appeals. A year ago Accardi was here contesting the dismissal of his habeas corpus petition in which he attacked the refusal of the Board of Immigration Appeals to grant his application for suspension of deportation. &lt;i&gt;Accardi&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Shaughnessy,&lt;/i&gt; 347 U. S. 260 (1954). The sole foundation of his claim was that "the Attorney General [is doing] precisely what the regulations forbid him to do: dictating the Board's decision."&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; 347 U. S. 260, at 267. We remanded the petition to the trial court for a hearing on the question of "the Board's alleged &lt;i&gt;failure to exercise&lt;/i&gt; its own discretion, contrary to existing valid regulations." It was alleged on information and belief that the Attorney General had prepared prior to the Board's decision "a list of one hundred individuals whose deportation he sought . . ." as "unsavory characters"; that Accardi's name was among the group; and that the "list . . . was circulated by the Department of Justice among all of its employees connected with the Immigration Service and the Board of Immigration Appeals" with the result that "since that time it has been impossible for [Accardi] to secure fair consideration of his &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*282&lt;/span&gt; case." We concluded that, if Accardi could prove that the Board had not exercised its own discretion in the matter, he should receive "a new hearing before the Board without the burden of previous proscription by the list."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the remand, the District Court, after a full hearing, found that the Board members "reached their individual and collective decision on the merits, free from any dictation or suggestion . . ." and again dismissed the writ. The Court of Appeals reversed, one judge dissenting, 219 F. 2d 77. The opinion of the court based its conclusion on the ground that the "Attorney General's statements [had] &lt;i&gt;unconsciously&lt;/i&gt; influence[d] the Board members so that they felt obliged not to exercise their discretion and, without doing so, to decide against Accardi." The chief judge, concurring in the result, thought that our prior opinion merely required Accardi to prove "that there was a list as alleged, that he was on it, and that this fact was known to the Board." The dissenting judge, on the other hand, read our opinion as meaning "no more . . . than that [Accardi's] allegations sufficiently charged `dictation' by the Attorney General," entitling Accardi to a hearing on the question of "whether the Board's denial of discretionary relief represented its own untrammelled decision or one dictated by the Attorney General." P. 90. He concluded that the finding of the trial judge was not clearly erroneous. We agree with the dissenting judge both as to the interpretation of our prior opinion and its application to the facts of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opinion of the court recognized that, before Accardi was entitled to another Board hearing, he had to prove that a majority of the Board not only knew of the "list" but were affected by it. However, the opinion concluded that the Board's position that its judgment had not been affected by "the list" was incredible. We find nothing &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*283&lt;/span&gt; incredible in the uncontradicted testimony produced before the trial judge through a number of witnesses including the Board members. The record shows that in fact there was no list, as such, and hence that one could not have been circulated among the members of the Board; that the fanfare of publicity complained of was in connection with the Attorney General's "deportation program"; that this program was never publicly related to Accardi until after the Board's decision; that only one Board member knew Accardi was covered by the program, while two others and the Chairman never had such knowledge until after their decision; that the fifth member asserted that he "may have known [of Accardi's inclusion in the program] but . . . couldn't say"; and that no person in the Department of Justice ever directly or indirectly approached any Board member as to the matter. It seems to us that the record fully supports the District Court's conclusion that the Board's decision represented the free and undictated decision of each member. Among the eight witnesses who gave testimony concerning the matter, was the Attorney General. He testified that there was no list; that his investigation "indicated that [Accardi] was a racketeer and that is the reason [he] moved to deport him"; that he "never at any time discussed this matter with any member of the [Board]." In the face of such evidence, we do not believe that speculation on the effect of subconscious psychological pressures provides sufficient justification for rejecting the District Court's finding as clearly erroneous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accardi emphasizes the trial court's finding that the Board had notice of the program and of his inclusion therein. This "notice," at most, was given only to the calendar clerk of the Board so that the hearing of certain cases might be expedited. The testimony that it was not furnished to members of the Board or the Chairman is undisputed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*284&lt;/span&gt; We believe that Accardi has had the hearing required by our previous opinion and that he has failed to prove his case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed and remanded.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER joins, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is disagreement here as there was in the Court of Appeals as to precisely what was meant by our former opinion and holding in this case. &lt;i&gt;Accardi&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Shaughnessy,&lt;/i&gt; 347 U. S. 260. This is not surprising in view of ambiguity of language at its best. The Court gives our former opinion a different and in some respects a narrower meaning than I would. I think the Court's interpretation deprives Accardi of a right which I thought our first opinion guaranteed him as far as possible under existing law&#151;an opportunity to have his rights determined by a tribunal which had not already made up its mind based on anonymous information. Consideration of this basic issue requires a more extensive reference to the record in this and the prior case than the Court has found it necessary to give. Accardi's rights cannot be fairly determined on broad legal generalizations or by merely interpreting our former opinion. If that opinion means no more than the Court indicates then Accardi's right to have suspension of his deportation determined without prejudgment by the Attorney General has never been passed on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accardi, born in Italy, came to this country in 1932, when he was 21 years old. He entered the United States &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*285&lt;/span&gt; from Canada, intending to remain here permanently. But he had no immigration visa. Under the law this made him a deportable alien. Proceedings to deport him were begun in 1947. He married in 1949 and has one child. His wife and child depend on him for support. Because of his original illegal entry, Accardi was ordered deported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basis of this controversy is not the original order of deportation but is Accardi's application for suspension of that order under &#167; 19 (c) of the Immigration Act of 1917.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; That section provides that under certain circumstances the Attorney General "may" suspend deportation of an alien upon proof that he has had good moral character for the preceding five years. The Act does not require the Attorney General to hold hearings or make findings in suspension cases. But regulations properly promulgated by the Attorney General do provide for hearings, and as we held in the prior &lt;i&gt;Accardi&lt;/i&gt; case those regulations have the effect of law. In other words, our holding was that the Attorney General can no more deny the suspension without hearings prescribed by the regulations than he could if such hearings had been prescribed by Congress itself. And as we explained in our prior opinion, the law through the regulations now provides for aliens like Accardi to obtain "decisions at three separate administrative levels below the Attorney General&#151;hearing officer, Commissioner, and the Board of Immigration Appeals." 347 U. S., at 266. The Board is appointed by the Attorney General and can be removed by him whenever he pleases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The habeas corpus petition considered in this case and the prior one alleged that the deportation order and the order denying favorable discretionary relief were both null and void, violated due process and should be set &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*286&lt;/span&gt; aside. The two chief grounds alleged were: (1) The decision to deny favorable discretionary relief to Accardi "was pre-judged by the Attorney General on October 2, 1952," which was six months before the Board of Immigration Appeals finally acted on Accardi's application for suspension; (2) The Attorney General had so widely publicized and circulated statements about his plan to deport Accardi that it was impossible for the Attorney General's subordinates to grant fair consideration to Accardi's application for suspension of deportation. An exhibit attached to the petition showed that the Attorney General on October 2, 1952, publicized that "the Justice Department hopes to strip citizenship rights from 100 foreign-born racketeers and deport them" and that Accardi was one of these alleged racketeers. Other exhibits showed that after the Board of Immigration Appeals decision against Accardi in April, 1953, it was announced by the Department of Justice that the Board's action was taken "under the current denaturalization and deportation program of Attorney General Brownell against top racketeers and subversives." The District Court in the original proceedings refused to permit Accardi to offer evidence to prove that the Attorney General had prejudged his case and that the circumstances were such that the Attorney General's subordinates could not give a fair trial. The District Court then summarily dismissed the case and the Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, affirmed. 206 F. 2d 897. It was that case we reversed in our prior opinion the meaning of which is now in controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the case reached us we said in part as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The petition alleges that the Attorney General included the name of petitioner in a confidential list of `unsavory characters' whom he wanted deported; public announcements clearly revealed that the Attorney General did not regard the listing as a mere &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*287&lt;/span&gt; preliminary to investigation and deportation; to the contrary, those listed were persons whom the Attorney General `planned to deport.' And, it is alleged, this intention was made quite clear to the Board when the list was circulated among its members. In fact, the Assistant District Attorney characterized it as the `Attorney General's proscribed list of alien deportees.' To be sure, the petition does not allege that the `Attorney General ordered the Board to deny discretionary relief to the listed aliens.' It would be naive to expect such a heavy-handed way of doing things." 347 U. S., at 267.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pointing out that "the allegations are quite sufficient" we went on to say that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If petitioner can prove the allegation, he should receive a new hearing before the Board without the burden of previous proscription by the list. After the recall or cancellation of the list, the Board must rule out any consideration thereof and in arriving at its decision exercise its own independent discretion, after a fair hearing, which is nothing more than what the regulations accord petitioner as a right. Of course, he may be unable to prove his allegation before the District Court; but he is entitled to the opportunity to try." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 268.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that petitioner proved beyond all peradventure that the Attorney General did "prejudge" Accardi's case as alleged. Under our former opinion this was enough to justify relief. But this crucial question was not passed on at all by the District Court in this case. It went on the theory that we held that petitioner was entitled to relief only if he could establish that the Board of Immigration Appeals felt itself "dictated to" by the Attorney General so that it could not give a recommendation based on its own discretion. In my view this was an unwarranted &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*288&lt;/span&gt; narrowing of the issues raised. But the Court today seems to accept this as the full scope of our prior holding. Given that narrow scope, our holding fell far short of deciding the issues which were actually presented and were due to be decided if, as we said, Accardi was entitled to "a fair hearing, which is nothing more than what the regulation accords petitioner as a right."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final analysis under both statute and regulations the discretion to be exercised is that of the Attorney General. Due to the regulations, however, that discretion can no longer be exercised arbitrarily or without hearings. A fair hearing by an impartial board has been established as a prerequisite to final exercise of discretion by the Attorney General. Failure to await these required hearings and findings before deciding to deport is therefore a violation of the very regulations the Attorney General has prescribed under authority of law. That the suspension of deportation of Accardi was prejudged long before the Board of Immigration Appeals made its decision is established by the undisputed testimony of Hon. James P. McGranery who was the Attorney General on October 2, 1952. He testified that he did have a planned program at that time for the deportation of selected aliens. Shortly thereafter he gave out a statement that the arrest of a certain named alien "was another step in his denaturalization and deportation program aimed at ridding the Nation of undesirable aliens engaged in racketeering and other criminal activities." The Attorney General testified that this statement accurately reflected his program. He also testified that "Joseph Accardi's case was one of the earliest cases submitted, and his case was already on appeal at the time . . . . But my investigation and the record of Accardi proved him, to my satisfaction, to be a racketeer. That is why I put him on there." In testifying about the beginning of his deportation program, the Attorney General said, "I had a conference very early in my administration &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*289&lt;/span&gt; with John Edgar Hoover. I asked him to prepare for me, after combing his records, names of persons who were engaged in subversive activities and subject to deportation, . . . racketeers and undesirables who were here in the country and subject to deportation . . . ." To carry out his program the Attorney General required a "progress report" to be submitted to him every day concerning the activities of the previous day. Accardi, he said, had been defined by him as a racketeer because of information received from the FBI, and that was the reason he "moved to deport him." The record shows that Attorney General Brownell continued to carry out the particular deportation program Attorney General McGranery had begun. On April 3, the day the Board of Immigration Appeals decided against Accardi, Attorney General Brownell issued a press release announcing that "Accardi, known as a New Jersey racketeer, is a native of Sicily, Italy, and brother of Samuel Accardi against whom denaturalization proceedings are pending in the Federal court at Newark." Later the Attorney General in a speech referred to Accardi as an "undesirable," and an Assistant Attorney General in a speech listed Accardi among a number of so-called "nationally known hoodlums who are the objects of the program."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is significant that on the very day Attorney General Brownell referred to Accardi as a "racketeer," the Board of Immigration Appeals found as a fact from evidence that he was "considered a person of good moral character." Moreover, there was no evidence before the Board to show that Accardi was or ever had been a "racketeer." The record therefore establishes that the Attorney General not only prejudged Accardi's case against him but evidently did so on the basis of anonymous information that he was a racketeer. It may be as Judge Frank suggested that in so characterizing Accardi the Attorney General confused him with someone else. However this &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*290&lt;/span&gt; may be, the record leaves no doubt that the Attorney General's office decided to deport Accardi on the ground that he was a "racketeer" and that this characterization was continued by the Attorney General long after the Board had refused to suspend Accardi's deportation although finding that he had a good moral character. The Attorney General's prejudgment deprived Accardi of the benefit of the Attorney General's discretion fairly exercised after a hearing as the law prescribes. For this reason the case should be affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also other reasons why I think this judgment should be affirmed and the case sent back to the Board of Immigration Appeals to carry out the directions of the Court of Appeals. Whatever this Court's prior opinion may have meant, the case should not go off on the District Court's finding of fact that the Board of Immigration Appeals actually exercised its own untrammeled discretion despite what the Attorney General said or did. That finding rests almost entirely on testimony given by the Board members themselves denying that they were influenced by the Attorney General's planned program to deport certain named aliens. I deem it bad practice to subject administrative officers, acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, to a probe of the mental processes which led them to decide as they did. That is what the Court sanctions here. We have already decided that this practice is no more desirable than that of probing the minds of judges to try to fathom the reasons which prompt their decisions. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Morgan,&lt;/i&gt; 313 U. S. 409, 421-422.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the Board members' state of mind may have been, I think the Attorney General's publications placed the Board of Immigration Appeals, the members of which hold office completely at his will, in a position that no judicial agency should be. Copies of newspaper interviews and speeches made by two Attorneys General and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*291&lt;/span&gt; an assistant, which appear in the record, proclaim a strong desire and purpose to carry out a program under which Accardi and a large group of others named from time to time were to be stripped of citizenship and deported from this country. The District Court found that notice of this program was given to the Board. This Court, however, distinguishes between information given to the Secretary of the Board and to the Board itself. But a program of this kind, so well-publicized that it went to every part of the United States and to various political gatherings, could hardly be expected not to permeate the Board of Immigration Appeals working in the Department of Justice in Washington. Orders and proclamations of the Attorney General, head of that Department, cannot be thought to have so little influence or effect in his Department. It is true that the statements and program of the Attorney General are now referred to as intended to do no more than "expedite" action by the Attorney General's subordinates, including the Board of Immigration Appeals. But this program according to the evidence occupied the most prominent place in the Department's activities. Daily reports had to be made to the Department by those men who carried on the program. They were selected because of their outstanding ability and aggressiveness. So what we have is not merely a finding by the District Court that the Attorney General's program was sent to the Board. We have in addition a showing of departmental emphasis on that program which makes it impossible to believe that the subordinates were oblivious to the Attorney General's great interest in deporting the particular men whose names appeared on his "proscribed list" or "program" or "statistical data" as it was variously termed by government witnesses. The requirement for fair administration of justice is not satisfied by a mere finding based on Board members' testimony that this particular Board at this particular time was strong enough &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*292&lt;/span&gt; to resist the plain implications of the Attorney General's strong program for deportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inevitability of what was to happen to Accardi after his name was put on the "Attorney General's proscribed list of alien deportees" is rather strongly indicated by the fact that not one of these aliens has ever been granted final discretionary relief allowing him to remain in this country. In an effort to show that aliens on the list are not barred from discretionary relief, the Government refers to four specific cases. In two of those cases, however, the aliens were not deportable under existing law and thus the Board did not reach the question of discretionary relief. In the third case the alien was allowed to leave voluntarily instead of being forcibly deported as he otherwise would have been. In the fourth case the Board did actually recommend that deportation be suspended. But that is not the full picture. The hearing officer who had recommended the alien's immediate deportation was investigated after the Board's recommendation of suspension. The Department of Justice concluded that he had been derelict in not fully developing "important derogatory information" concerning the alien and announced that he had been relieved of duty and that disciplinary action would be taken against him.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; At the instance of the Department, as the Government's brief points out, the Board granted a rehearing on the alien's right to suspension which appears to be still pending. Thus the Attorney General cannot point to a single case in which one of the proscribed aliens has been finally granted a discretionary suspension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my opinion that petitioner proved that the Attorney General's publicized program made it impossible to expect his subordinates to give Accardi's application &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*293&lt;/span&gt; that fair consideration which the law requires. The use of administrative bodies as agencies of justice under law is seriously weakened by proceedings such as these. We should adhere to the spirit of our first opinion and require that the Board hold a fair hearing in Accardi's case after "the recall or cancellation" of this "list" as the Court of Appeals ordered.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; The implications of the Attorney General's program and statements must be repudiated before this Board can be considered the kind of free and impartial tribunal which our system of justice demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"10. The Attorney General, on April 23, 1954, a few days after the Supreme Court's decision came down, issued instructions that the Board should not be influenced in its decisions by his `program' but, in each case, should exercise independent judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"11. Accardi must be released from custody unless, within a reasonable time, the Board, under those new instructions, holds a new hearing and renders a new decision on his application for discretionary relief. Although the Board has already found that he has a good moral character, he should have the opportunity at the new hearing to offer evidence that he is not and never has been a racketeer. For it may be that, in so characterizing Accardi, the Attorney General has confused him with someone else of the same name." 219 F. 2d 77, 83.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued April 5, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided May 23, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;James T. Wright&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A. L. Wirin&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With them on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Frank J. Donner.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Robert W. Ginnane&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Beatrice Rosenberg&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;John R. Wilkins.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 20, 1950, the petitioner was indicted under 2 U. S. C. &#167; 192 for refusing to answer thirty-two questions put to him by a subcommittee of the Committee on Un-American Activities of the House of Representatives. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*220&lt;/span&gt; During the trial in the District Court for the District of Columbia, the Government abandoned twenty-four of these counts. The District Judge, sitting without a jury, found Bart guilty of the remaining eight charges.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the judgment upon three of the counts and, one judge dissenting, affirmed as to the others.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; From that decision, we granted certiorari&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; and set the case down for argument along with the two companion cases. &lt;i&gt;Quinn&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 155, and &lt;i&gt;Emspak&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 190.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to a subpoena, petitioner appeared before the subcommittee on June 21, 1950. He was then general manager both of Freedom of the Press Co., Inc., which publishes the &lt;i&gt;Daily Worker,&lt;/i&gt; and of the &lt;i&gt;Daily Worker&lt;/i&gt; itself. During the course of the interrogation, members of the committee and the committee counsel posed various questions dealing with Bart's background, his activities, and alleged associates. Among these were the five questions which, because of petitioner's refusal to answer, led to the convictions now under scrutiny. The particular inquiries involve petitioner's name when he came to this country as a child, his name before it was changed years ago to Philip Bart pursuant to a New York court order,&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; his father's name, and the identity of officials of the Ohio section of the Communist Party in &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*221&lt;/span&gt; 1936.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; To the questions concerning name or family background, he raised objections of pertinency; to the other, he unequivocally pleaded the privilege against self-incrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In finding petitioner guilty, the trial court rejected these defenses as without merit. Before the Court of Appeals, petitioner abandoned his defense as to lack of pertinency. The majority thought that this abandonment in effect erased petitioner's objections from the committee record and that they were thus faced with "naked refusals to answer"&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; which did not require affirmative rulings from the committee. We cannot agree. The objections were in fact made before the committee and the witness was entitled to a clear-cut ruling at that time, even though the claims were later abandoned or found to be invalid. &lt;i&gt;Quinn&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, supra.&lt;/i&gt; Without such a ruling, evidence of the requisite criminal intent to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*222&lt;/span&gt; violate &#167; 192 is lacking. An abandonment made two and one-half years after the objections were raised cannot serve retroactively to eliminate the need for a ruling. If the requirement of criminal intent is not satisfied at the time of the hearing, it cannot be satisfied &lt;i&gt;nunc pro tunc&lt;/i&gt; by a later abandonment of petitioner's objection.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; Therefore, the issue before us is, upon the record as it stood at the completion of the hearing, whether petitioner was apprised of the committee's disposition of his objections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At no time did the committee directly overrule petitioner's claims of self-incrimination or lack of pertinency. Nor was petitioner indirectly informed of the committee's position through a specific direction to answer. At one juncture, Congressman Case made the suggestion to the chairman that the witness "be advised of the possibilities of contempt"&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; for failure to respond, but the suggestion was rejected. The chairman stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"No. He has counsel. Counsel knows that is the law. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner."&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few moments later, when committee counsel inquired as to certain details of petitioner's marriage, the following colloquy took place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. UNGER [Counsel for petitioner]. Mr. Chairman, what concern is it of anybody here&#151;&#151;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. WALTER. We permit you to appear with your client for the purpose of advising your client. You apparently are old enough to have had some experience in court.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. UNGER. Yes, indeed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. WALTER. Of course, you know there are many preliminary questions asked witnesses, leading up to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*223&lt;/span&gt; some point. As they are propounded you will readily learn what the purpose is. Just advise your client and don't argue with the committee, &lt;i&gt;because we don't rule on objections.&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questioning proceeded on this basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the consistent failure to advise the witness of the committee's position as to his objections, petitioner was left to speculate about the risk of possible prosecution for contempt; he was not given a clear choice between standing on his objection and compliance with a committee ruling.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; Because of this defect in laying the necessary foundation for a prosecution under &#167; 192, petitioner's conviction cannot stand under the criteria set forth more fully in &lt;i&gt;Quinn&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, supra.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our disposition of the case makes it unnecessary to consider petitioner's other contentions. The judgment below is reversed and the case remanded to the District Court with directions to enter a judgment of acquittal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE REED, with whom MR. JUSTICE MINTON joins, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case is controlled entirely by the rule enunciated by the majority in the second ground for the decision in &lt;i&gt;Quinn&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 155. We shall not here repeat our comments made regarding that rule and its application which are set out in our dissent in the &lt;i&gt;Quinn&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Emspak&lt;/i&gt; cases. But we cannot agree that under the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*224&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Quinn&lt;/i&gt; rule the petitioner here was not sufficiently apprised of the disposition of his Fifth Amendment and pertinency objections for him to be held guilty of violating &#167; 192. For us the record establishes, as it did for the two courts below, that the petitioner knew that the grounds for his objections were not accepted by the committee; that the committee required him to answer; that he willfully refused to answer. As the majority stated the rule in &lt;i&gt;Quinn,&lt;/i&gt; p. 170, "the committee is not required to resort to any fixed verbal formula to indicate its disposition of the objection. So long as the witness is not forced to guess the committee's ruling, he has no cause to complain." Under this rule we think that the extract from the record set out below places this petitioner in the status of one who "has no cause to complain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter: Did you ever hold any positions other than positions with newspapers?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart: I did.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter: What were they?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart: I was organizer and head of the Communist Party at different times, in different years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter: Where?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart: In Illinois and Pennsylvania, among many.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Tavenner: The Daily Worker of March 28, 1936, shows you to have been a section organizer for the Communist Party in Ohio. That is correct, is it not?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart: Most likely.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Tavenner: Well, you know whether you were a section organizer for the Communist Party in Ohio, do you not?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart: I do not know the exact period of time you mentioned. It is 14 years ago.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Tavenner: &lt;i&gt;Who were the other officials of the Ohio section of the Communist Party during the&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*225&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;period of time you were organizer there?&lt;/i&gt; [Count 8, emphasis supplied.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart: I object to this question. I will not answer it, standing on my rights in accordance with Article V of the Constitution, and furthermore I protest because this committee has asked this question of numerous people and has infringed upon their rights as American citizens.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Tavenner: I think, Mr. Bart, I should point out that your testimony relating to other people who were associated with you at that time could not in any way incriminate you under the Fifth Amendment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Unger: I should like to correct you, Mr. Tavenner.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter: You advise your client.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Tavenner: You have told us you were a section organizer for the Communist Party in Ohio, and my question now is, who were the officials who worked with you in that work, that is, officials of the Ohio section of the Communist Party?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Unger: Permit me to advise my client that Mr. Tavenner, counsel, is in error in his interpretation of the Constitution so far as the Fifth Amendment is concerned, and that Mr. Bart, the witness, is entirely correct in his interpretation of the Constitution, and has a right to assert that this committee has no right&#151;no right, let me make it plain&#151;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter: Under our procedure the attorney is permitted to advise his client and then the client, the witness, answers the question. You may advise your client.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;.....&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Unger: As he has stated in his previous answer, he is not required to testify against himself.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*226&lt;/span&gt; "Mr. Bart: I stand on the advice of my counsel. I am not required to testify against myself, and in accordance with Article V of the Constitution I will not answer the question.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Tavenner: I was not asking you to testify against yourself. I was asking you to state the names of other persons associated with you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart: I consider this an attempt on the part of the committee to use this against myself as well as against others, as it has on many previous occasions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter: And therefore you refuse to answer?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart: I refuse to answer."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colloquy set out above pertains only to count 8.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; We think the record also shows that the committee rejected the pertinency objections on the other four questions which constitute the other four counts and therefore petitioner willfully refused to answer these as well. However, since conviction on any one count is sufficient to sustain the judgment, enough of the record is set out above to show what we consider to be the error of the majority. Since in our view the committee apprised the petitioner that his Fifth Amendment objection was rejected, it is necessary to state our agreement with the courts below that, as the record shows, petitioner had waived the privilege by his answers to prior questions concerning his Communist Party affiliation and activities. We agree with the Court of Appeals that this is controlled by &lt;i&gt;Rogers&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 340 U. S. 367. &lt;i&gt;Bart&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 91 U. S. App. D. C. 370, 376, 203 F. 2d 45, 51.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be better practice for congressional committees to follow a procedure of specifically overruling &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*227&lt;/span&gt; objections of witnesses and directing the witnesses to answer in the manner commonly followed in the courts. We feel, however, that in this case, where the petitioner was apprised that his objection was rejected and he still refused to answer, it should be held that he is guilty of a violation of &#167; 192. We would affirm the judgment below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would affirm the judgment of conviction in this case, on the reasoning stated in part II of my dissenting opinion in the &lt;i&gt;Emspak&lt;/i&gt; case, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 203, at p. 213, decided this day. To what is said there I should add what follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even under the Court's standard of "apprisal," the record in this case is convincing that Bart must have understood that the Subcommittee was insisting on his answers to the questions involved in the indictment. I need only refer to the fact that four of the counts of the indictment charge Bart with refusing to answer what was in substance the same question, namely, what Bart's name had been before he changed it. As to these questions the record shows the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Case [Committee Member]. What was your name at the time you came to the United States?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart. I have already answered this question.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter [Committee Chairman]. What was it?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Unger [Bart's Counsel]. Mr. Chairman, I think we are spending a good deal of time, with all due respect to the Chair, on a point that has absolutely no bearing on any issue here.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter. That is only your opinion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Unger. I said that was my opinion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Case. Mr. Chairman, I don't know what the question will lead up to, but it certainly has been customary, when we have been interrogating witnesses &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*228&lt;/span&gt; who have come to the United States from other countries, to know when they came to the United States, and to know under what name they came, and to know the name shown on the passport. There is nothing improper or out of the way in asking such a question. I think we should have an answer to the question of the name he had when he came to the United States.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Unger. Are you suggesting the inquiry has to do with what this man did when he was 10 years old? You are talking about a 10-year-old boy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter. Just a moment. I think Mr. Tavenner should be able to proceed, and after his questions, Mr. Case, you may ask such questions as you may desire. May I suggest, Mr. Tavenner, that you refresh the witness' recollection by telling him what his name was before he assumed his present name? Proceed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Tavenner [Committee Counsel]. You are a naturalized American citizen?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart. Yes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Tavenner. How did you become naturalized?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart. Through process of my father.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Tavenner. What was your father's name?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart. I have already dealt with this question.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Tavenner. When was your father naturalized?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart. I do not remember.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Unger. Just a minute.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(Witness confers with his counsel.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart. About 30 years ago.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Tavenner. Do you refuse to tell the committee your father's name?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Unger. Mr. Tavenner, he doesn't refuse to tell the committee. He is trying to tell the committee &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*229&lt;/span&gt; that this line of inquiry is a highly improper one.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter. That is not within his province. The committee determines what is proper and what is not proper, and it is not up to you to determine that.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Unger. That is true.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Case. Mr. Chairman, it seems to me the counsel should advise his client and not the committee.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Unger. I am not trying to advise the committee. I tried to respectfully point out why it is an improper question. He is not ashamed of his father's name or his mother's name. What difference can it possibly make what his name was when he came here?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter. We are not going to have you arguing with the committee or giving us your legal opinion, which may or may not be worth anything.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Unger. I have no further comment on the question.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter. All right.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart, you claim citizenship by virtue of your father's citizenship; is that right?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart. That is right.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter. Under what name did your father become a citizen of the United States?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart. Under his own name.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter. What was that name?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart. I have already stated my reply to this question as far as I am concerned.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter. How can you claim citizenship by virtue of your father's citizenship if you don't know what name your father used when he became a citizen?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Unger. Mr. Chairman&#151;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*230&lt;/span&gt; "Mr. Walter. Let the witness answer the question. You may advise your client.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart. I have answered I am a citizen by virtue of that fact, and that this is my legal name by which I vote and am registered and am known.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter. When did you legally change your name?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart. Many years ago.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter. Where?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart. In the city of New York.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter. Did you have your name changed in court?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart. Yes; about 15 years ago.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Unger. His answer is about 15 years ago.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter. I understand. What name did you change your name from?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart. I have already stated my reply to this question.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Harrison [Committee Member]. I understand you refuse to answer the chairman's question?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart. My answer is that I have answered what my name is here, which is the only question pertaining to the inquiry, it seems to me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter. Of course all of this is a matter of public record?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Bart. Correct.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter. And then I suppose you know that under the law a question innocent on its face can't be arbitrarily ignored. You can't refuse to answer such a question without running the risk of the consequences.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Unger. I think, again, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Bart has indicated very plainly he has not been contumacious in any regard. He states his name has been Philip Bart for a large number of years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*231&lt;/span&gt; "Mr. Walter. Don't argue with the committee. You advise your client as you see fit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Case. Mr. Chairman, it seems to me the witness should be advised of the possibilities of contempt when he fails to answer a question as simple and as proper as your question as to what his name was before it was changed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Walter. No. He has counsel. Counsel knows that is the law. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner."&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very fact that the same answer was sought in four different ways must have impressed upon a man of Bart's intelligence that the Committee considered his objections unfounded, and wished him to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the reasons stated in my &lt;i&gt;Emspak&lt;/i&gt; dissent, I do not deal with any of the petitioner's other contentions, save to say that on this record I consider them all untenable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would affirm the judgment of conviction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11]  In one instance, committee counsel observed that in his opinion the question asked was not incriminating, but this was disputed by counsel for petitioner and not ruled upon by the chair. When petitioner repeated the objection, stating that he felt the question to be of an incriminating nature and that he therefore refused to answer, the question was immediately abandoned. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 2638-2639.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[*]  The Court attaches importance to the colloquy between Mr. Case and Mr. Walter shown in the last two paragraphs quoted above, and to Mr. Walter's later rejoinder to Mr. Unger: "Of course, you know there are many preliminary questions asked witnesses, leading up to some point. As they are propounded you will readily learn what the purpose is. Just advise your client and don't argue with the committee, &lt;i&gt;because we don't rule on objections.&lt;/i&gt;" (Italics supplied by the Court.) Read in context, these excerpts indicate to me nothing more than that the committee was expressing its impatience with interruptions by counsel. I am unable to read the record, as the Court seems to have done, as indicating that the Subcommittee was avoiding taking a position on Bart's objections.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This is a companion case to Quinn v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xiB/thomas-quinn-petitioner-v-united-states-of/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;349&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;155&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 75 S.Ct. 668. Challenged in each proceeding is a conviction under 2 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 192, 2 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 192, in the District Court for the District of Columbia.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; The two cases arose out of the same investigation by the Committee on Un-American Activities of the House of Representatives. Because of the similarity of the legal issues presented, the cases were consolidated for argument in this Court.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p2"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Pursuant to subpoena, petitioner appeared on December 5, 1949, before a subcommittee of the Committee on Un-American Activities. The subcommittee consisted of a single member, Rep. Morgan M. Moulder. Petitioner was then the General Secretary-Treasurer of the United Electrical, Radio &amp;amp; Machine Workers of America as well as Editor of the UE News, the union's official publication. The subcommittee's hearings had previously been announced as concerning 'the question of Communist affiliation or association of certain members' of the union and 'the advisability of tightening present security requirements in industrial plants working on certain Government contracts.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p3"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Petitioner was asked a total of 239 questions. Most dealt with the structure of the union, the duties of its officers, the scope of its membership and bargaining commitments, the alleged similarity in policies of the UE News and the Communist Party, the non-Communist affidavit that petitioner had filed with the National Labor Relations Board, and related matters. Petitioner answered all of these questions. He declined, however, to answer 68 of the 239 questions. These 68 questions dealt exclusively with petitioner's associations and affiliations. He based his refusal on 'primarily the first amendment, supplemented by the fifth.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; Of the 68 questions, 58 asked in substance that he state whether or not he was acquainted with certain named individuals and whether or not those individuals had ever held official positions in the union. Two of the questions concerned petitioner's alleged membership in the National Federation for Constitutional Liberties and the Civil Rights Congress. Eight questions concerned petitioner's alleged membership and activity in the Communist Party.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p4"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;On November 20, 1950, petitioner was indicted under &amp;#167; 192 for his refusal to answer the 68 questions.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; Sitting without a jury, the District Court held that petitioner's references to 'primarily the first amendment, supplemented by the fifth' were insufficient to invoke the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="fn5_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; The District Court accordingly found petitioner guilty on all 68 counts and sentenced him to a term of six months and a fine of $500. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, three judges dissenting, affirmed en banc.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6" id="fn6_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; From that decision this Court granted certiorari.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn7" id="fn7_ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p5"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;As pointed out in Quinn v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xiB/thomas-quinn-petitioner-v-united-states-of/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;349&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;155&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 75 S.Ct. 668, no ritualistic formula or talismanic phrase is essential in order to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination. All that is necessary is an objection stated in language that a committee may reasonably be expected to understand as an attempt to invoke the privilege. In the Quinn case we hold that Quinn's references to "the First and Fifth Amendments" and "the First Amendment to the Constitution, supplemented by the Fifth Amendment" were sufficient to meet this standard. It would be unwarranted, we think, to reach a different conclusion here as to petitioner's plea based on 'primarily the first amendment, supplemented by the fifth.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p6"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Government does not even attempt to distinguish between the two cases in this respect. Apparently conceding that petitioner as well as Quinn intended to invoke the privilege, the Government points out 'the probability' that his references to the Fifth Amendment were likewise deliberately phrased in muffled terms 'to obtain the benefit of the privilege without incurring the popular opprobrium which often attaches to its exercise.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn8" id="fn8_ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; On this basis the Government contends that petitioner's plea was not adequate. The answer to this contention is threefold. First, an objection that is sufficiently clear to reveal a probable intention to invoke the privilege cannot be ignored merely because it is not phrased in an orthodox manner. Second, if it is true that in these times a stigma may somehow result from a witness' reliance on the Self-Incrimination Clause, a committee should be all the more ready to recognize a veiled claim of the privilege. Otherwise, the great right which the Clause was intended to secure might be effectively frustrated by private pressures. Third, it should be noted that a committee is not obliged to either accept or reject an ambiguous constitutional claim the very moment it is first presented. The way is always open for the committee to inquire into the nature of the claim before making a ruling. If the witness intelligently and unequivocally waives any objection based on the Self-Incrimination Clause, or if the witness refuses a committee request to state whether he relies on the Self-Incrimination Clause, he cannot later invoke its protection in a prosecution for contempt for refusing to answer that question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p7"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Government argues that petitioner did in fact waive the privilege, at least as to one count of the indictment, and that the conviction can be sustained on that count alone.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn9" id="fn9_ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt; In response to a question concerning his associations, petitioner expressed apprehension that the committee was 'trying to perhaps frame people for possible criminal prosecution' and added that 'I think I have the right to reserve whatever rights I have. * * *'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn10" id="fn10_ref"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; The following colloquy then took place:&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn11" id="fn11_ref"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p8"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Moulder. Is it your feeling that to reveal your      knowledge of them would subject you to criminal prosecution? 'Mr. Emspak. No. I don't think this committee has a           right to pry into my associations. That is my own           position.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p9"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Petitioner's reply, it is contended, constituted an effective disclaimer of the privilege. We find this contention without merit. As this Court declared in Smith v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x7K/smith-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;337&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;137&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 150, 69 S.Ct. 1000, 1007, 93 L.Ed. 1264: 'Although the privilege against self-incrimination must be claimed, when claimed it is guaranteed by the Constitution. * * * Waiver of constitutional rights * * * is not lightly to be inferred. A witness cannot properly be held after claim to have waived his privilege * * * upon vague and uncertain evidence.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p10"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Smith case, we believe, is controlling here. The witness in that case, at the outset of questioning by an OPA examiner, stated "I want to claim privilege as to anything that I say." The examiner accepted this statement as a plea of possible self-incrimination and a request for the immunity afforded to involuntary witnesses by the Price Control Act of 1942, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, &amp;#167; 901 et seq. The questioning proceeded on that basis. In response to one question, however, the witness made a statement that appeared to the examiner to be voluntary. This colloquy then ensued:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p11"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Question. This is a voluntary statement. You do not claim      immunity with respect to that statement? Answer. No.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p12"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In a subsequent prosecution of the witness for violation of the Price Control Act, it was held that his 'No' answer waived his immunity at least as to the one statement.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn12" id="fn12_ref"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt; This Court unanimously reversed, stating, 337 U.S. at page 151, 69 S.Ct. at page 1007: 'Without any effort to clarify the 'No', the examiner went ahead and had the witness restate the substance of the long answer * * * without any further intimation that the subsequent answers were considered by the examiner to be voluntary. We do not think under these circumstances this equivocal 'No' is a waiver of the previous definite claim of general privilege against self-incrimination.' Similarly, in the instant case, we do not think that petitioner's 'No' answer can be treated as a waiver of his previous express claim under the Fifth Amendment. At most, as in the Smith case, petitioner's 'No' is equivocal.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn13" id="fn13_ref"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; It may have merely represented a justifiable refusal to discuss the reasons underlying petitioner's assertion of the privilege; the privilege would be of little avail if a witness invoking it were required to disclose the precise hazard which he fears.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn14" id="fn14_ref"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt; And even if petitioner's 'No' answer were taken as responsive to the question, the answer would still be consistent with a claim of the privilege. The protection of the Self-Incrimination Clause is not limited to admissions that 'would subject (a witness) to criminal prosecution'; for this Court has repeatedly held that 'Whether such admissions by themselves would support a conviction under a criminal statute is immaterial'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn15" id="fn15_ref"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt; and that the privilege also extends to admissions that may only tend to incriminate.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn16" id="fn16_ref"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt; In any event, we cannot say that the colloquy between the committee and petitioner was sufficiently unambiguous to warrant finding a waiver here. To conclude otherwise would be to violate this Court's own oft-repeated admonition that the courts must 'indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver of fundamental constitutional rights.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn17" id="fn17_ref"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p13"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Throughout this entire proceeding&amp;#8212;in the trial in the District Court, on appeal in the Court of Appeals, and here on certiorari-the Government has never denied that petitioner would be entitled to the protection of the privilege if he did in fact invoke it. And during argument in this Court the Government expressly conceded that all 68 questions were of an incriminatory character. In addition, neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals saw fit to introduce the issue into the case. We are therefore reluctant to do so now. But doubts on the issue by some members of the Court make its consideration necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p14"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'To sustain the privilege,' this Court has recently held, 'it need only be evident from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn18" id="fn18_ref"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt; And nearly 150 years ago Chief Justice Marshal enunciated a similar test: 'Many links frequently compose that chain of testimony which is necessary to convict any individual of a crime. It appears to the court to be the true sense of the rule that no witness is compellable to furnish any one of them against himself.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn19" id="fn19_ref"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt; Applying this test to the instant case, we have no doubt that the eight questions concerning petitioner's alleged membership in the Communist Party fell within the scope of the privilege.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn20" id="fn20_ref"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; The same is true of the two questions concerning petitioner's alleged membership in the National Federation for Constitutional Liberties and the Civil Rights Congress; both organizations had previously been cited by the committee as Communist-front organizations. There remains for consideration the 58 questions concerning petitioner's associations. This Court has already made abundantly clear that such questions, when asked in a setting of possible incrimination, may fall within the scope of the privilege.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn21" id="fn21_ref"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p15"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;What was the setting&amp;#8212;as revealed by the record&amp;#8212;in which these questions were asked? Each of the named individuals had previously been charged with having Communist affiliations. On October 14, 1949, less than two months prior to petitioner's appearance before the committee, eleven principal leaders of the Communist Party in this country had been convicted under the Smith Act for conspiring to teach and advocate the violent overthrow of the United States.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn22" id="fn22_ref"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt; Petitioner was identified at their trial as a Communist and an associate of the defendants. It was reported that Smith Act indictments against other Communist leaders were being prepared. On November 23, 1949, two weeks prior to petitioner's appearance, newspapers carried the story that the Department of Justice 'within thirty days' would take 'an important step' toward the criminal prosecution of petitioner in connection with his non-Communist affidavit filed with the National Labor Relations Board.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn23" id="fn23_ref"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p16"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Under these circumstances, it seems clear that answers to the 58 questions concerning petitioner's associations 'might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.' To reveal knowledge about the named individuals&amp;#8212;all of them having been previously charged with Communist affiliations&amp;#8212;could well have furnished 'a link in the chain' of evidence needed to prosecute petitioner for a federal crime, ranging from conspiracy to violate the Smith Act to the filing of a false non-Communist affidavit under the Taft-Hartley Act, 29 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 141 et seq. That being so, it is immaterial that some of the questions sought information about associations that petitioner might have been able to explain away on some innocent basis unrelated to Communism. If an answer to a question may tend to be incriminatory, a witness is not deprived of the protection of the privilege merely because the witness if subsequently prosecuted could perhaps refute any inference of guilt arising from the answer.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn24" id="fn24_ref"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class="center"&gt;II.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p17"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;There is here, as in the Quinn case, a second ground for our decision. At no time did the committee specifically overrule petitioner's objection based on the Fifth Amendment, nor did the committee indicate its overruling of the objection by specifically directing petitioner to answer. In the absence of such committee action, petitioner was never confronted with a clear-cut choice between compliance and noncompliance, between answering the question and risking prosecution for contempt. For the reasons set out in the Quinn opinion, we believe the committee&amp;#8212;by failing to meet these minimal procedural standards, originally recognized by the committee and recently re-adopted&amp;#8212;did not adequately apprise petitioner that an answer was required notwithstanding his objections. And without such apprisal, there is lacking the element of deliberateness necessary for a conviction under &amp;#167; 192 for a refusal to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;III.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p18"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Our disposition of the case makes it unnecessary to pass on petitioner's other contentions as to the First Amendment and the grand jury. The judgment below is reversed and the case remanded to the District Court with directions to enter a judgment of acquittal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p19"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p20"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Justice REED, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p21"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Justice HARLAN, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p22"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;A valid claim of privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment has two requisites: (1) the privilege must be adequately invoked, and (2) a possible answer to the question against which the privilege is asserted must have some tendency to incriminate the person to whom the question is addressed. Although Emspak's invocation of the privilege left much to be desired, I agree with the majority's view that it was adequate, and that Emspak at no time abandoned his claim. But I must dissent from the Court's holding that all of the questions involved in the indictment called for possibly incriminatory answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p23"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Court also holds, as an alternative ground for reversing Emspak's conviction for contempt of the House Subcommittee, that Emspak was not sufficiently apprised of the fact that the Subcommittee, notwithstanding the claim of privilege, was insisting upon answers to the questions put to him. From this holding I must also dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p24"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;My disagreement with the Court on both scores goes to the first 58 counts of the indictment.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1-1" id="fn1-1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; As the Court's opinion recognizes, the upholding of Emspak's conviction on any one count of the indictment would require affirmance of the judgment below, because the general sentence imposed on all counts was less than the maximum allowable on any single count. See Sinclair v. United States, 1929, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/w9w/sinclair-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;279&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;263&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 299, 49 S.Ct. 268, 273, 73 L.Ed. 692.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class="center"&gt;I.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p25"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;As to the Incriminatory Character of the 58 Questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p26"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It is quite true, as the majority observes, that this issue was not dealt with by either of the courts below. The District Court and the Court of Appeals did not have to reach the problem because of their conclusion that Emspak's claim of privilege was inadequate. And for some reason the Government has not pressed the point. This, however, does not foreclose this Court from considering it. See Swift &amp;amp; Co. v. Hocking Valley R. Co., 1917, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/vp8/swift-co-v-hocking-valley-r-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;243&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;281&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 289, 37 S.Ct. 287, 289, 61 L.Ed. 722. And perhaps it is due that I should explain why I think we should deal with it. My reason is twofold: first, because to hold, as the Court does, that the questions involved in Counts 1 to 58 of the indictment were of an incriminatory character seems to me to verge on an abandonment of the rule that a valid claim of privilege exists only as to incriminatory questions; and second, because the more recent decisions of this Court appear to me to leave the standard for determining whether a question is incriminatory in great confusion. For example, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit had occasion not so long ago to manifest its bewilderment as to where this aspect of the privilege against self-incrimination now stands in light of recent decisions of this Court. See United States v. Coffey, 1952, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca1/2chs/maffie-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;198&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;438&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. In short, I think the standard for judging the character of a question against which the Fifth Amendment privilege is asserted needs both rehabilitation and restatement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p27"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(1) The standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p28"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The concept of an incriminating answer includes not only those answers which constitute an admission of guilt, but also those which may furnish evidence of guilt or merely supply a lead to obtaining such evidence. Counselman v. Hitchcock, 1892, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/tHu/counselman-v-hitchcock/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;142&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;547&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 12 S.Ct. 195, 35 L.Ed. 1110.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p29"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The answer to almost any question a witness is asked could be regarded as being useful as evidence, or as furnishing a lead to evidence, in support of some conceivable criminal charge against the person to whom the question is addressed. But unlike a defendant in a criminal case, a witness in a grand jury or other judicial or legislative proceeding has never been allowed, by claiming his privilege, to refuse to answer any questions at all. That would completely subordinate the public interest in the conduct of such proceedings. Accordingly, lest claims of the Fifth Amendment privilege be used as a cover for a person refusing to perform his duty to co-operate in such proceedings, reasonable bounds have been put upon the exercise of the privilege. Those bounds were stated as long ago as 1861 by the English Court of Queen's Bench in The Queen v. Boyes, 1 B. &amp;amp; S. 311, 330&amp;#8212;331, in language which this Court has adopted as the basis for the rule in this country. See Brown v. Walker, 1896, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/u4L/brown-v-walker/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;161&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;591&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 599&amp;#8212;600, 16 S.Ct. 644, 647&amp;#8212;648, 40 L.Ed. 819; Mason v. United States, 1917, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/vqv/mason-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;244&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;362&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 365&amp;#8212;366, 37 S.Ct. 621, 622&amp;#8212;623, 61 L.Ed. 1198. In the Boyes case, Cockburn, C.J., said:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p30"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Further than this, we are of opinion that the danger to be      apprehended must be real and appreciable, with reference to      the ordinary operation of law in the ordinary course of      things&amp;#8212;not a danger of an imaginary and unsubstantial      character, having reference to some extraordinary and barely      possible contingency, so improbable that no reasonable man      would suffer it to influence his conduct. We think that a      merely remote and naked possibility, out of the ordinary      course of the law and such as no reasonable man would be      affected by, should not be suffered to obstruct the      administration of justice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p31"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The object of the law is to afford to a party, called upon to      give evidence in a proceeding inter alios, evidence in a      proceeding inter alios, protection against being brought by      means of his own evidence within the penalties of the law.      But it would be to convert a salutary protection into a means      of abuse if it were to be held that a mere imaginary      possibility of danger, however remote and improbable, was      sufficient to justify the withholding of evidence essential      to the ends of justice.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p32"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Throughout the course of its decisions this Court has consistently stated that the 'real danger imaginary possibility' test is the proper standard to be applied in deciding whether particular questions are subject to a valid Fifth Amendment claim. See Brown v. Walker, supra; Heike v. United States, 1913, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/v4A/heike-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;227&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;131&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 144, 33 S.Ct. 226, 228, 57 L.Ed. 450; Mason v. United States, supra; Rogers v. United States, 1951, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xaK/rogers-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;340&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;367&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 71 S.Ct. 438, 95 L.Ed. 344; Blau v. United States, 1950, 340, U.S. 159, 161, 71 S.Ct. 223, 224, 95 L.Ed. 170; Hoffman v. United States, 1951, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xbQ/hoffman-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;341&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;479&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 486, 71 S.Ct. 814, 818, 95 L.Ed. 1118. But in recent per curiam reversals of contempt convictions this Court seems to have indicated a tendency to stray from the application of this traditional standard.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2-1" id="fn2-1_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; And I shall presently show that it has departed from that standard in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p33"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The next question requiring consideration is: How should this standard be applied in a case where the questions appear on their face to call only for innocent answers? In United States v. Weisman, 1940, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca2/8GHD/united-states-v-weisman/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;111&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;260&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit had before it a claim of the Fifth Amendment privilege to a question in substantially the following form: 'Did you know anyone who visited or lived in Shanghai between 1934 and 1939?' On the surface of things&amp;#8212;had nothing more appeared&amp;#8212;the possible answers to this question&amp;#8212;' Yes,' 'No' or 'I don't know'&amp;#8212;would all appear innocent. A situation could be imagined in which one of these answers would have tended to incriminate, but this possibility by itself would not be enough to justify the claim of privilege. Additional facts appeared, however, which showed the question to be part of an incriminatory pattern: the witness was a New York night club proprietor, unlikely to be acquainted with Shanghai residents or visitors, and he had engaged in transactions looking suspiciously like importations of narcotics from China. Because of these and other facts, a real danger of incrimination from answering the question was held to exist by the court, through Judge Learned Hand. It may be argued that the admission sought was not sufficiently implicating to justify the invocation of the privilege, see Wigmore, Evidence, &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 2260&amp;#8212;2261; but for present purposes we may assume that the result is a correct one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p34"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Of course, in some cases the background facts making an apparently innocent question dangerous may not be known to the court. Then the choice must be made between requiring the court to accept the witness' word that facts exist which would make his answer incriminating, and requiring the witness to explain the circumstances which justify his claim of privilege. To be sure, the second alternative involves the danger that the witness will have to reveal some incriminatory evidence in order to show why he should not be required to answer. Nevertheless, traditionally the witness has not been allowed to be sole judge of the character of the questions objected to; he is required to open the door wide enough for the court to see that there is substance to his claim. United States v. Weisman, supra. If the background facts are known or suspected to exist, this problem disappears, for all the witness has to do is point to such facts or suspicions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p35"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(3) Application of the standard to dangerous questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p36"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;36&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It seems to me that the 'real danger imaginary possibility' standard ought to be applied in the same fashion to dangerous questions. Such questions include those which call for an admission of a crime or a necessary element of a crime, or a fact which, while innocent on its face, is dangerous in the light of other facts already developed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p37"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;37&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In all such cases other facts may appear which serve to cast an innocent aspect upon the question. Suppose two men are suspected of having conspired to steal cash from a bank one day during business hours. Each is asked whether he saw the other on the day of the theft, and each pleads his privilege. But facts already developed in the investigation show that both men are tellers in this bank and have worked in the same cage for ten years. Certainly, in these circumstances, the fact of each having seen the other cannot rationally be said to have any tendency to establish their guilt, or, in any realistic sense, to aid the prosecution in discovering evidence against them, since the prosecution already would be expected to have independent evidence of their presence in the bank on that day. In other words, if background facts can make an innocent question dangerous, they can also make a dangerous question innocent. And in deciding whether the privilege is available, we must take into account all the facts&amp;#8212;not just those tending to make the question dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p38"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;38&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;I do not suggest that in a trial for contempt a Fifth Amendment defense should be set at naught whenever the prosecution is able to offer an exculpatory explanation for an otherwise incriminating answer. What I do submit is that the privilege should not be available when the facts have been sufficiently developed at the time the claim of privilege is made so that it is plain that no possible answer to the question put to the witness could rationally tend to prove his guilt or supply the prosecution with leads to evidence against him. In such circumstances there is no real danger of harm to the witness to be apprehended from his answering the question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p39"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;39&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(4) Application of the standard to this case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p40"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;I come finally to the issue as to how the 'real danger imaginary possibility' standard should be applied to the questions involved in the first 58 counts of the indictment.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3-1" id="fn3-1_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; Typical of these questions were the following: 'Are you acquainted with Joseph Persily?'; 'Is Max Helford at the present time a field organizer for the UE?'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p41"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;41&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;On their face, and without more, these questions were certainly innocent enough. And therefore the first issue confronting us is whether other existing background facts and circumstances made the questions incriminatory. We start from these premises: From the announced purposes of the Subcommittee and the pattern of its questioning of witnesses, it is a fair inference that one of the Subcommittee's objectives was to show that communists held positions of responsibility in this Union. This in turn might be the starting point for prosecutions for filing false noncommunist affidavits under the Taft-Hartley Act&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4-1" id="fn4-1_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; or for violations of the Smith Act.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5-1" id="fn5-1_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; The conclusion also seems justified that most, if not all, of the persons referred to in the 58 questions put to Emspak, and Emspak himself, were suspected of being communists or of having communist affiliations. Indeed, the Government on the oral argument conceded as much. Had Emspak admitted knowing any of these people, this might tend to show association with communists. While the decisions of this Court do not establish that these factors would have sufficed to make those questions incriminatory, lower courts have gone far in this direction. See Kasinowitz v. United States, 9 Cir., 1950, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca9/29RU/kasinowitz-v-united-states-steinberg-v-united-stat/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;181&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;632&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; United States v. Raley, D.C.1951, 96 F.Supp. 495; see also Falknor, Self-Crimination Privilege: 'Links in the Chain,' 5 Vand.L.Rev. 479, 485&amp;#8212;489 (1952).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p42"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;But there were also other background facts and circumstances. Emspak had told the Subcommittee that he was Secretary of the Union. He was asked if other named individuals held positions in the same Union, and with respect to some of them, whether he knew them personally. These things being so, it is difficult to see how the fact that Emspak knew some of these people or what position each held in the Union can rationally be said to support even an inference that he knew of their alleged communist affiliations, much less tend to prove that he himself had taken part in a conspiracy to advocate the forcible overthrow of the Government or had falsely sworn that he was not a communist. Nor could the answers to the questions have been of material assistance in providing leads to evidence to be used against him. Investigators presumably would already know that the Secretary of the Union knew other Union officials. Thus, in light of Emspak's admitted position, the questions appear proper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p43"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;43&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This conclusion is not affected by the additional possibility that Emspak's answers might have been admissible against him in a later criminal trial. If the answers were admissible, this fact should not of itself make the questions incriminatory, even though the answers might have been utilized by the prosecutor to show Emspak's acquaintance with these other persons as a first step in proving conspiracy, and the prosecutor would thus have been spared the necessity of proving this acquaintance by independent evidence. But in fact Emspak's answers would not have been admissible against him in such a trial. For at the time Emspak testified before the Subcommittee, a federal statute prevented the use of any of his testimony before that body as evidence against him in any later criminal proceedings, except a prosecution for perjury in the giving of the testimony.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6-1" id="fn6-1_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; Thus, to the extent that the incriminatory character of these questions depends solely upon the admissibility of Emspak's answers in evidence against him in a later criminal trial, there could hardly be a valid objection to them on this score.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p44"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;44&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In the last analysis, the Court's holding seems to rest on the premise that the questions put to Emspak became automatically incriminatory once it was shown that he and those about whom he was interrogated were under suspicion of communism. This is painting with too broad a brush.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p45"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;45&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It is true that under the rule as it exists a witness may sometimes have to walk a tightrope between waiver of his privilege, if he answers a question later held to be incriminatory, and contempt, if he refuses to answer a question later held to be nonincriminatory. And it may be that in some circumstances the privilege should be held to extend to questions which are not in themselves incriminatory, but which seem likely to lead to other questions which are. But in my view any such doctrine should be regarded as an exception to the general rule and should be confined to cases where special circumstances exist which make it unfair to apply the ordinary rule, such as where the witness is without counsel, is ignorant or confused, and the like. Some of the decisions of lower courts seem to suggest that in proceedings obviously designed to develop a case against a particular witness, the witness may be allowed to invoke the privilege as to all questions, as may a defendant in a criminal case. See Marcello v. United States, 5 Cir., 1952, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca5/2bbL/marcello-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;196&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;437&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; Maffie v. United States, 1 Cir., 1954, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca1/2chs/maffie-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;209&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;225&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. I think, however, that such a view is too sweeping, and also that where there is room for the application of an exception to the ordinary rule, it should be done openly, and not under the guise of holding nonincriminatory questions incriminatory. No circumstances are shown here which would call for the application of any such exception. Emspak was represented by counsel and was obviously an intelligent and shrewd witness. The inference most readily drawn from the record is that Emspak did not want to 'stool pigeon' against his associates. While such a motive would not, in my opinion, vitiate an otherwise valid claim of the privilege, it certainly furnishes no legal excuse for refusing to answer nonincriminatory questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;II.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p46"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;46&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;As to Emspak's Knowledge That the Subcommittee Wanted Its Questions Answered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p47"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;47&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The majority holds that whenever a witness objects to a question there is no violation of 2 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 192, 2 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 192, until he is clearly apprised that the Committee demands his answer, notwithstanding his objection. Until then, so the Court holds, the witness has not evidenced the requisite criminal intent, that is, a deliberate refusal to answer. The Court elaborates this thesis in the Quinn case, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xiB/thomas-quinn-petitioner-v-united-states-of/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;349&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;155&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 75 S.Ct. 668, decided today, and applies it in this case and in the Bart case, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xiD/bart-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;349&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;219&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 75 S.Ct. 712, also decided today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p48"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;48&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;I am unable to accept the Court's holding on this score, and agree with Mr. Justice REED'S criticism of it in his two dissenting opinions in these three cases. I consider it desirable, however, to elaborate somewhat upon what Mr. Justice REED has said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p49"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;49&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Section 192 speaks only of refusal to answer. 'Refusal' implies simply recognition of what the Committee is after and failure either to supply it or to explain an inability to supply it. It only confuses the matter to say that the 'refusal' must be 'intentional' or 'deliberate' or that it must manifest a 'criminal intent.' Indeed, Sinclair v. United States, 1929, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/w9w/sinclair-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;279&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;263&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 299, 49 S.Ct. 268, 273, 73 L.Ed. 692, upon which the Court relies, was later discussed in United States v. Murdock, 1933, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wnu/united-states-v-murdock/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;290&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;389&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 396, 397, 54 S.Ct. 223, 226, 78 L.Ed. 381, and the Court there pointed out that &amp;#167; 192 does not make a bad purpose or evil intent an ingredient of the crime of refusing to answer a question pertinent to the matter under inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p50"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Beyond this, I see no reason for thinking that when a witness couples an objection with a refusal to answer, his refusal becomes any the less 'deliberate' or 'intentional.' The Court holds that if the objection were accepted by the Committee, the requirement of 'deliberateness' would not have been met. For my part, the proper analysis of such a situation is rather that there has been a 'refusal to answer,' and thus at least a prima facie violation of the statute, but the Committee has chosen not to press the matter further. What the Committee does after the witness makes his objection should not be held to have any bearing on the question whether there was a refusal, or on the question whether it was 'deliberate,' if that connotes anything more. Those questions must be determined as of the time the witness speaks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p51"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;51&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Thus I do not see how the Court's result can be hinged to any language in the statute. Perhaps a privilege to object could be derived, however, from what must be taken to be the statute's overall purpose: to enable committees to obtain the information they wish without at the same time treating witnesses unfairly. Thus, a witness might be held privileged to refuse to answer a question, for the purpose of presenting, at reasonable length, a colorable objection to the propriety of the question. But this privilege would terminate when it became reasonably apparent to the witness that the objection was not acceptable to the Committee. Then the witness would have to choose between answering and standing on the validity of his objection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p52"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;52&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;If this is the standard which the Court's construction establishes, I would quarrel only with its application here. But in requiring that a witness who objects be 'clearly apprised' that his objection is unsatisfactory and that the Committee wishes his answer, the Court may have meant to go further. If that is so, then I would question the standard itself. Moreover, I think that even this more lenient standard would have been met in this case. For surely the record shows that Emspak was clearly apprised that, despite his objections, the Committee wanted answers to the 58 questions, so that there is a violation of the statute under either standard. After Emspak had answered a number of preliminary questions concerning the organization of his Union, the following discussion took place between him, Congressman Moulder, and Mr. Tavenner, the Committee Counsel:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p53"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Tavenner. Mr. Emspak, are you acquainted with Joseph      Persily?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p54"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;54&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. Mr. Chairman, I would like to say something at      this point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p55"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;55&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Moulder. You mean in response to the question?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p56"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;56&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. I will answer the question; yes, in response to      the question and as a statement of position.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p57"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;57&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'What I say revolves around two points, one organizationally      and another as an individual. Organizationally, my job as an      officer of this union is to represent the interest of the      membership as they determine it at the annual conventions and      at other means they have of getting together and expressing      themselves. My job is to administer that aspect to the best      of my ability, using one very simple measuring stick, and      that is: Does a given policy or action contribute to the      well-being of the membership, individually and collectively?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p58"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;58&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'As an individual I would like to say one thing, and that is      this: The line of questioning that counsel is developing now      is a line that has been used on numerous occasions by this      committee and other congressional committees in an attempt to      harass the union, its leadership, and its members. It is a      line of questioning that goes against my grain as an      American. I was born in this country. Everything I am&amp;#8212; 'Mr. Moulder.

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. Everything I am, I owe to the rich heritage and      tradition of this country.

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. Your activities are designed to harm the working      people of this country. Every action this committee has ever      taken has done that. You interfered last summer in the      election of a local union at the request of a priest. You      know that. You dragged down the prestige of this country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p81"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;81&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Moulder. You are not going to take over this committee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p82"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;82&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. I don't want to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p83"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;83&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Moulder. And your statements are preposterous. The      purpose of this committee is to expose communism as it exists      in this country. What is the question?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;85&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. For the reasons I stated before, I answered it.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;86&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;92&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. I have answered it to the best of my ability      under the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="num" id="p93"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;93&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;94&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Tavenner. Yes. In what capacity is Joseph Persily      associated with the UE at this time?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p95"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;95&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. It is the same question over again. I will give      the same answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p96"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;96&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p97"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;97&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. Mr. Chairman, it is the same question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p98"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;98&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Tavenner. You refuse to answer that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p99"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;99&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Mr. Emspak. I answered it.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Following this, Emspak was asked 55 questions of exactly the same character as those relating to Persily, to each of which he reiterated, with minor variations: 'Same answer.' This was obviously, on this record, nothing other than a formula for refusing to answer without appearing to do so. In the face of such a record, I find it impossible to understand how the Court can conclude that Emspak was not clearly apprised of the fact that the Subcommittee wanted his answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p101"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;101&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Were this opinion being written for the Court, it would be necessary, before affirming this conviction, to deal with the other points Emspak urges for reversal. Since the Court, under its view of the case, did not reach any of them, I think it would not be appropriate for me to discuss them. I am therefore content to say that I find none of those points tenable on this record.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p102"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;102&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Moulder. Are you going to answer the question?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Emspak. Because of the hysteria, I think it is my duty to endeavor to protect the rights guaranteed under the Constitution, primarily the first amendment, supplemented by the fifth. This committee will corrupt those rights.' (Italics added.)&lt;/p&gt;

Matles, a UE official who testified before the committee on the same day as Emspak and who similarly relied on 'the First and Fifth Amendments.' Hearings, supra, note 2, Part II, at 856. The court held that Matles' plea was sufficient to invoke the Self-Incrimination Clause because it appeared that Rep. Moulder so understood it.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; However, I do agree with the Court that the privilege was available as to the questions involved in Counts 59 through 68 of the indictment, since, under the circumstances shown by the record, each of those questions did call for a possibly incriminatory answer. Because this would in any event require reversal of the conviction on those counts, as to them I need not reach the issue of whether Emspak was adequately apprised that the Subcommittee was insisting upon his answers, despite the claim of privilege.&lt;/p&gt;

But an official paper or record produced by him is not within the said privilege.' The statute, falling short of a complete grant of immunity to the witness from prosecution on account of testimony given by him, would not have been effective to compel testimony over a valid claim of privilege, but it was effective to prevent the use of such testimony against the witness in a subsequent criminal prosecution. See Adams v. State of Maryland, 1954, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xgK/adams-v-maryland/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;347&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;179&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 182&amp;#8212;183, 74 S.Ct. 442, 98 L.Ed. 608. This statute was in effect until August 20, 1954, when it was superseded by 68 Stat. 745. The supersession would not affect the inadmissibility of testimony given while the old statute was in effect. See Cameron v. United States, 1914, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/v9w/cameron-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;231&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;710&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 34 S.Ct. 244, 58 L.Ed. 448.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The possibility that a witness might commit perjury in answering a question has never been regarded as justification for invoking the privilege to the question. See Noonan, Inferences from the Invocation of the Privilege Against Self-Incrimination, 41 Va.L.Rev. 311, 321&amp;#8212;322 (1955).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Argued April 19, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided May 23, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seymour Sheriff&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Assistant Attorney General Holland&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Ralph S. Spritzer, Ellis N. Slack, Lee A. Jackson&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;I. Henry Kutz.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case is a companion case to &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Olympic Radio &amp;amp; Television, Inc., ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 232. The main point in the two cases is the same&#151;whether a taxpayer on the accrual basis can, in computing its net operating loss for one year, deduct the amount of excess profits &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*238&lt;/span&gt; taxes which were paid in that year but had accrued in an earlier year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The years 1944 and 1945 were years of profit for the taxpayer. For the years 1946 and 1947, the taxpayer incurred net operating losses which were allowed by the Commissioner as carry-back deductions to the years 1944 and 1945. The taxpayer sought to augment its net operating loss for 1946 by the amount of excess profits taxes which it paid in 1946 on account of its 1945 excess profits tax liability. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction and the Tax Court sustained the Commissioner. 18 T. C. 1245. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 215 F. 2d 518. The case is here on a petition for certiorari which we granted (348 U. S. 895) to resolve the conflict with the &lt;i&gt;Olympic Radio&lt;/i&gt; case. Our views, as expressed in the latter case, coincide with those of the Court of Appeals. Accordingly, we affirm that part of the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is present in this case a point not involved in the &lt;i&gt;Olympic Radio&lt;/i&gt; case. The question is whether the excess profits tax that may be offset against 1944 net income is the amount of excess profits tax reported for the year in question or the amount ultimately found to be due. The taxpayer claims it is the former; the Commissioner, the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question centers on &#167; 122 (b) (1) and &#167; 122 (d) (6). As we have seen in the &lt;i&gt;Olympic Radio&lt;/i&gt; case, &#167; 122 (b) (1) directs that the net operating loss for a given year be carried back to the two preceding taxable years.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; And &#167; 122 (d) (6) allows as a deduction "the amount of tax &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*239&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;imposed by&lt;/i&gt; Subchapter E of Chapter 2 [&lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; the excess profits tax] paid or &lt;i&gt;accrued&lt;/i&gt; within the taxable year . . . ." (Italics added.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taxpayer's net income for 1944, as shown by its return, was $827,852.99; and, as finally determined, was $584,866.81. The excess profits tax due according to its 1944 return was $625,561.59. The Commissioner, after allowing as a deduction a net operating loss carry-back of $164,326.38 arising in 1946, and making other adjustments, ultimately determined the taxpayer's excess profits tax liability for 1944 to be $280,540.33. The Commissioner computed the net income for 1944 at $304,326.48, that is, $584,866.81 minus $280,540.33. Since the net operating loss of $164,326.38 was less than $304,326.48, there was no loss to be carried back to 1945, as &#167; 122 (b) (1) provides ". . . that the carry-back in the case of the first preceding taxable year shall be the excess, if any, of the amount of such net operating loss over the net income for the second preceding taxable year . . . ."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taxpayer, however, contends that the excess profits tax "accrued" in 1944 is the tax shown on its return for that year, &lt;i&gt;viz.,&lt;/i&gt; $625,561.59. If this larger amount is the correct figure, then the deduction allowed against 1944 income will be so great as to leave a carry-back which can be deducted against 1945 income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy turns on the meaning of the clause in &#167; 122 (d) (6) which reads, "the amount of tax imposed by Subchapter E of Chapter 2 . . . accrued within the taxable year . . . ." The Commissioner contends that the tax "imposed" is the tax ultimately determined to be due. The argument is that the taxpayer having once got back, through credit or refund, the difference between the amount of the tax "accrued" in 1944 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*240&lt;/span&gt; and the amount finally determined to be due, no double benefit should be inferred. The double benefit, it is argued, should certainly be denied when the figure upon which it is based has no economic reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the rule that general equitable considerations do not control the measure of deductions or tax benefits cuts both ways. It is as applicable to the Government as to the taxpayer. Congress may be strict or lavish in its allowance of deductions or tax benefits. The formula it writes may be arbitrary and harsh in its applications. But where the benefit claimed by the taxpayer is fairly within the statutory language and the construction sought is in harmony with the statute as an organic whole, the benefits will not be withheld from the taxpayer though they represent an unexpected windfall. See &lt;i&gt;Bullen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin,&lt;/i&gt; 240 U. S. 625, 630.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Congress wrote the word "imposed" into &#167; 122 (d) (6), it might have used it in one of two different senses&#151;either to identify the tax or to define the amount of the tax that is to be levied and collected. We think that Congress used "imposed" in the former sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first place, the deduction allowed by &#167; 122 (d) (6) is not the tax "imposed" by Subchapter E of Chapter 2. It is "the amount of tax imposed by Subchapter E of Chapter 2 . . . accrued within the taxable year." The word "imposed" when used in conjunction with "accrued" makes tolerably clear that "imposed" merely identifies or describes the tax that "accrued." That is to say, the sentence as a whole indicates that "imposed" is used merely by way of reference. It seems clear that Congress had that understanding. The Senate Finance Committee reported:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Section 122 of the Code, relating to computation of the net operating loss deduction allowed by section 23 (s) of the Code, is amended so as to allow the excess profits tax paid or accrued within taxable &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*241&lt;/span&gt; years (subject to certain rules) as a deduction in computing net operating loss for, and net operating loss carry-over and carry-back from, such taxable years." S. Rep. No. 1631, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 67. And see H. R. Rep. No. 2333, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 65.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That indicates that the test of deductibility under &#167; 122 (d) (6) is whether the tax "accrued" within the taxable year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the general section dealing with deductions, &#167; 23, allows deductions for taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year, with certain specified exceptions. &#167; 23 (c). Some of the excepted taxes are identified by well-known names, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; federal income taxes, estate, inheritance, legacy, succession, and gift taxes. See &#167; 23 (c) (1) (A), (D). Other taxes excepted are identified by reference to the taxes "imposed" by certain provisions of the law. Thus &#167; 23 (c) (1) (B) excepts "war-profits and excess-profits taxes imposed by . . . Subchapter E of Chapter 2." The applicable Treasury Regulation indicates that the word "imposed" identifies the tax. It provides: "Subject to the exception stated in this section . . . taxes imposed by the United States . . . are deductible from gross income for the year in which paid or accrued." 26 CFR &#167; 39.23 (c)-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 23 is especially relevant here, since the language of &#167; 122 (d) (6) was taken almost verbatim from &#167; 23. That section as amended by the Revenue Act of 1941 had provided that, in computing net income, a deduction for taxes "paid or accrued within the taxable year" should be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As respects the excess profits tax, &#167; 23 (c) (2) provided:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"For the purposes of this subsection, in the case of the excess-profits tax &lt;i&gt;imposed&lt;/i&gt; by Subchapter E of Chapter 2&#151;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(A) The deduction shall be limited to the &lt;i&gt;tax imposed&lt;/i&gt; for the taxable year . . . ." (Italics added.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*242&lt;/span&gt; It would seem that (A) would have limited the &#167; 122 (d) (6) adjustment to the tax finally paid. But (A) was omitted from &#167; 122 (d) (6). The word "imposed" as used in the quantitative sense was dropped, while the word "imposed" as used to identify the tax was retained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the tax that "accrued" within a given year is not the tax finally determined to be due but the tax before ultimate adjustments are made. That is elementary in tax law. See &lt;i&gt;Security Flour Mills Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 321 U. S. 281, 284. It would seem therefore that the concept "accrued" embodies the annual accounting principle. If, in case of a taxpayer on the accrual basis, events after the taxable year are taken into account, the word "accrued" would be effectively read out of &#167; 122 (d) (6) or given a varied meaning, contrary to our ruling in the &lt;i&gt;Olympic Radio&lt;/i&gt; case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that the computations under &#167; 122 are designed to spread losses over a five-year period. But we are concerned with a technical concept that is being used as the basis of the formula for that reallocation. We find no justification for taking "accrued" as used in &#167; 122 (d) (6) to mean one thing in the setting of the &lt;i&gt;Olympic Radio&lt;/i&gt; case and another in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our conclusion is in accord with a line of related decisions. The whole tax scheme has been posited on the basis that the duty to pay is without regard to the deduction made available by the carry-back. See &lt;i&gt;Manning&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Seeley Tube &amp;amp; Box Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 338 U. S. 561, 567. Only recently we applied that principle to the excess profits tax. In &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Koppers Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 348 U. S. 254, we held that these taxes were payable in full the year when they were due and that interest was payable on the amounts so due, even though ultimately portions of the taxes were abated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the amount of tax accrued within the taxable year under &#167; 122 (d) (6) is to be determined in accord &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*243&lt;/span&gt; with the normal accounting concepts relevant to the accrual basis. That amount is not, of course, to be ascertained solely by reference to the figure set forth in the taxpayer's return, for that figure may be erroneously computed on the accrual basis. But when an amount is arrived at by proper application of recognized accounting principles on the accrual basis, the test of &#167; 122 (d) (6) has been met. Events and transactions of later years, irrelevant to a determination of income on the accrual basis, do not warrant alteration of the figure computed under &#167; 122 (d) (6) for the year in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed in part and reversed in part.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE REED and MR. JUSTICE BURTON join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case involves construction of a rather opaquely worded provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, &#167; 122. But the problem to which this section is directed, its objectives and the general plan by which they are pursued, ought not to elude clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our system of income taxation operates on an annual basis. Each taxpayer is required to determine, on the basis of knowledge available to him at the end of the taxable year, the amount of income or loss for that year. In its original strict form, this system did not permit readjustment of the annual income figure to reflect unanticipated events occurring in subsequent years&#151; for instance, repayment in a later year of money received from sale of goods or services and reported as income in the earlier year&#151;even though logically and practically these facts operated to reduce the income as originally reported. More important, the system required that a taxpayer with profit in one year and an equal loss &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*244&lt;/span&gt; in the next year pay taxes in the year of profit without regard to the loss in the next year, even though from a business and human point of view the taxpayer, over the broader period of two years, had no income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are dealing with certain ameliorations of the unduly drastic consequences of such a system in its rigid form. Primarily we have to consider &#167; 122 of the Internal Revenue Code, which, to a limited degree, permits reflection of the fact that income in one year may, in the not uncommon fluctuation of business affairs, have been offset by losses incurred in subsequent or preceding years. At the time here relevant, &#167; 122 provided that if a "net operating loss" in business operations occurred in one year, and net income had been or was later received in any of the two preceding or succeeding years, this net income could be cancelled against the loss by "carry-back" or "carry-over" of the loss to the year in which income was received. If the loss were carried back, reducing the income already reported, taxes already paid on the amount of income cancelled were to be refunded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripped of details, the scheme appears simple. However, with a view to dealing comprehensively with the multifarious manifestations of business activities, the scheme as embodied in intricate statutory form raises difficulties. They are accentuated in this case because of the relevance of other peculiarities of tax accounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the first question raised in this case, one already dealt with in &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Olympic Radio &amp;amp; Television, Inc., ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 232, brings into focus the differences between two tax accounting systems, one in which the year's transactions are recorded on a cash receipts and disbursements basis, and the other utilizing the accrual system. We agree that this taxpayer, whose taxes for all other purposes are calculated on the accrual system, must determine the amount of the loss which may be carried forward or back on the same basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*245&lt;/span&gt; The other question, however, brings into play the more complex provisions of &#167; 122 as well as a second statutory modification of the strict annual concept. This modification grows out of the "renegotiation" system devised by Congress to deal with potentialities of unconscionable profits to war contractors providing supplies to the Government. Under it, the contract price originally agreed upon between the contractor and the Government is subject to "renegotiation" at a later date to determine whether what originally had been thought to have been a fair price in fact proved overly generous. If so, the Government was entitled to a reduction in the price or, if payment had already been made, a refund of the disallowed profit. Naturally enough, the taxpayer was permitted to reflect the fact that he had been required to repay amounts on the basis of which he originally paid income taxes by reopening the earlier tax return, reducing the income reported and the tax due. 26 U. S. C. &#167; 3806 (b).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are concerned here with a taxpayer on the accrual basis which in 1946 suffered a net operating loss ($164,326.38), but in 1944 and 1945 had a considerable net income ($827,852.99&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; and $1,215,320.25 respectively). &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*246&lt;/span&gt; In 1944 and 1945 petitioner was therefore required to pay both corporate income and excess profits taxes. Much of the income accrued by petitioner in the year 1944 was derived from war contracts. Renegotiation in subsequent years reduced the amounts actually received or retained by petitioner below the figures reported for 1944 by $397,970.00. Petitioner, therefore, received a refund of excess profits taxes reflecting this fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the basis of petitioner's operating loss in 1946, it is entitled to carry back this loss under &#167; 122. Where, as here, the taxpayer has had net income in both of the two years preceding the loss year, that section directs that the carry-back be first applied to the earlier taxable year, 1944, and the remainder, if any, be applied to reduce income for 1945. It is not in dispute that petitioner could &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*247&lt;/span&gt; carry back to 1944 the full amount of the net operating loss which incurred in 1946, and petitioner's income and excess profits taxes for that year have been reduced to the full extent of this loss. Does anything remain to be applied in reduction of 1945 income?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress has provided a detailed formula for determining how much loss remains for application in 1945. The difficulty arises in applying the formula, because Congress has not made explicit, and so left in doubt, what set of figures may fairly be used in translating the generality of the formula into amounts. The difficulty is enhanced because the relevance of some of the factors used in the formula to any discernible congressional purpose is unclear. Logically one would expect that the statutory formula would be designed merely to permit application &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*248&lt;/span&gt; to 1945 of so much of the 1946 loss as was not used to cancel 1944 taxes. But Congress, for its own good reasons, felt that certain other factors should be reflected in this calculation. One factor, which it is not for us to explain, was the amount of the taxpayer's excess profits tax for 1944.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To vivify this problem, one must reduce to technical concreteness the statutory formula. It states, insofar as here relevant, that the amount of carry-back left for application in 1945 is the amount of the 1946 loss, less the figure arrived at by subtracting from "the net income for the second preceding taxable year [1944]," "the amount of tax imposed by Subchapter E of Chapter 2 paid or accrued within the taxable year [1944]." The latter is a dry statutory description of the excess profits tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus in addition to petitioner's 1944 net income, the formula makes the 1944 excess profits tax figure crucial. The question here is: what 1944 excess profits tax figure? The amount of the tax due on the basis of the taxpayer's knowledge at the close of the 1944 taxable year, that is, what its truthful balance sheet for that year indicated to be the tax ($625,561.59)? Or the amount of the tax which petitioner eventually and definitively had to pay after subsequent events had resulted in a downward revision of the originally reported 1944 tax ($318,577.67 tax reduction due to renegotiation, plus approximately $150,000.00 due to the carry-back of the 1946 loss)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is the former figure, petitioner's excess profits tax &lt;i&gt;reported&lt;/i&gt; in 1944 ($625,561.59) was larger (because it did not take into account the then unknown reduction due to renegotiation and carry-back) than the figure for 1944 net income ($584,866.81), which, for reasons later to be explained, all parties concede should be the figure used in the formula, one reflecting the fact of later renegotiation, but not reflecting the 1946 loss carry-back. Applying the formula on the basis of the larger excess profits &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*249&lt;/span&gt; figure, there is nothing to subtract from the 1946 loss, and the full amount of this loss is therefore available to offset 1945 net income and bring about a further refund of taxes for that year. But the full amount of the 1946 loss has already been applied in 1944 to offset the 1944 income and to bring about a refund for that year. Thus the Court's decision permits the loss in 1946 to offset twice as much income in 1944 and 1945.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, on the other hand, the 1944 excess profits tax figure is adjusted to reflect the reduction in the tax occasioned by renegotiation and the 1946 carry-back to 1944, the formula will not permit such double use of the 1946 loss; the difference between the 1944 net income figure ($584,866.81) and the adjusted 1944 excess profits tax ($280,540.33) is greater than the amount of the 1946 loss ($164,326.38).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either of these positions can be supported by arguments based solely upon the literal language of the statute. Here we are not compelled in our choice by austere regard for what Congress has written, undistorted or unmitigated by judicial rewriting, no matter what the consequences in a specific case. Where the taxing measure is clear, of course, there is no place for loose conceptions about the "equity of the statute." Revenue laws are notoriously not expressions of an ordered system of reason and fairness. There has probably never been a revenue statute which, by design or oversight, has not favored some groups and laid the basis for a claim of unfairness to others similarly situated. But while one should sail close to the shore of literalness in dealing with the technical problems which are the subject matter of revenue laws, literalness of meaning affixed merely to a particular word or phrase may itself distort what the provision as an entirety and in context conveys and therefore commands. And where ambiguous language is used, the mode of construction applied in &lt;i&gt;Olympic Radio, supra,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*250&lt;/span&gt; should not be ignored&#151;that deductions and credits are matters of legislative grace and the taxpayer must bring himself clearly within the relief he claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor does the decision in &lt;i&gt;Olympic Radio&lt;/i&gt; shed any light on our present problem. In that case we merely decided that an accrual taxpayer must be consistent in his choice of tax accounting systems&#151;that in calculating his loss for a given year he must use figures relevant to that year's operations, accrued figures, rather than figures based on cash payments related to transactions in a different year. We had no occasion to determine in that case whether the accrued figure to be used was to be the figure originally reported or the figure reflecting later adjustments to the original figure. That is the issue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucial phrases in determining whether the original or the adjusted figure for 1944 excess profits tax is to be used are: (1) "tax imposed by Subchapter E of Chapter 2," and (2) "paid or accrued within the taxable year." We agree that the first phrase serves merely to identify the nature of the tax referred to and vouchsafes nothing on the question in issue. We need not add to what the Court has said on this. We do not agree, however, that the second phrase compels the reading which the Court gives it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For purposes of payment of current annual taxes, the phrase "accrued within the taxable year" has come to mean the figure arrived at by taking into account only knowledge available at the end of the taxable year. This reflects the fact that our tax system is operated on an annual basis and that it would be difficult to permit continual reopening and readjustment of old returns in light of later developments. See &lt;i&gt;Burnet&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sanford &amp;amp; Brooks Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 282 U. S. 359; &lt;i&gt;Security Flour Mills Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 321 U. S. 281, 286; &lt;i&gt;Dixie Pine Products Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 320 U. S. 516, 519. Were we presented with a question whether the taxpayer owed the Government &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*251&lt;/span&gt; interest on a deficiency, existing at the time his return was filed, in payment of "accrued" taxes, we would agree that the tax "accrued" was the tax calculated on the basis of the situation at the end of the taxable year without regard to any later adjustment in the amount of tax due which eliminated the deficiency. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Manning&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Seeley Tube &amp;amp; Box Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 338 U. S. 561; &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Koppers Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 348 U. S. 254.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if "accrued" has this meaning generally in our taxing system, it has acquired this sense not because it inevitably, lexicographically speaking, has this meaning, but because of the inferences which have grown up about it through use in the context of annual payment of taxes. In short, usage, the ultimate glossator, has made it a term of art in this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present case, we deal with sections of the Code which express exactly the opposite philosophy from that which gave rise to this use of "accrued" as a technical term looking only to events occurring within a single year. We deal with sections which direct re-examination of returns for past years in an effort to ameliorate the short-sightedness of the annual system which fostered a restrictive, closed meaning of "accrued." The very purpose and direction of these sections require adjustments to earlier returns on the basis of subsequent facts. Surely in this context there is no rational reason for refusing to recognize the state of affairs as unfolded in the years which &#167; 122 directs you to re-examine&#151;the current year and two preceding years. Where the subsequent events are recognized by the Code as proper occasions for adjusting old returns, the arguments of administrative convenience which underlie closing the tax affairs of the year within the taxing year are empty because they have nothing to which they can apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 122 was designed to relieve the taxpayer from an unrealistic concept which taxed income which really &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*252&lt;/span&gt; was not there. Surely we should not conclude that Congress intended to go to the other extreme and refund taxes on the basis of losses which are really not there. There is confirmation within &#167; 122 itself which should preclude such result. It lies in subsection 122 (b) (1) (B),&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; which alone justifies the assumption, made by the Court and both parties, that the figure for 1944 net income to be used in the formula is the lower figure reflecting the adjustment for renegotiation ($584,866.81) rather than the one originally reported ($827,852.99). All the argument used to demonstrate that the 1944 excess profits figure should be the unadjusted figure proves with equal force that the 1944 net income figure should be the unadjusted figure. For "net income" for any given year is, generally speaking, arrived at by an accrual taxpayer by determining &lt;i&gt;accrued&lt;/i&gt; gross income and &lt;i&gt;accrued&lt;/i&gt; deductions for that year. &#167;&#167; 21 (a), 22, 23, 41, 42 (a), 43, 48 (c). Inherent, therefore, in &#167; 122's phrase "net income" is the same concept of "accrued" as is explicitly used in that section's reference to the excess profits tax. If "accrued" does not permit taking into account later adjustments to the tax, it does not permit reflection of adjustments to net income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But subsection 122 (b) (1) (B) shows clearly that Congress assumed that the formula we have been discussing would reflect subsequent adjustments to 1944 net income. That subsection states in effect that the figure for net income of 1944 used in the formula is not to reflect the fact that the 1946 net operating loss has already been carried back and applied to reduce 1944 net income. If Congress thought it necessary specifically to direct that a certain adjustment to 1944 net income arising from facts developed in later years should not be made, this can only be &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*253&lt;/span&gt; because Congress assumed that in applying the formula the figures used would reflect such adjustments. We recognize this assumption by taking as the 1944 net income figure the originally reported figure &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; the amount by which it was reduced as a consequence of renegotiation. There is no basis for differentiation, in recognizing this assumption, between net income and excess profits tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would affirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]  Section 122 (b) (1) provides:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1941, the taxpayer has a net operating loss, such net operating loss shall be a net operating loss carry-back for each of the two preceding taxable years, except that the carry-back in the case of the first preceding taxable year shall be the excess, if any, of the amount of such net operating loss over the net income for the second preceding taxable year computed (A) with the exceptions, additions, and limitations provided in subsection (d) (1), (2), (4), and (6), and (B) by determining the net operating loss deduction for such second preceding taxable year without regard to such net operating loss."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  For convenience of reference and because in most instances it makes no difference in the ultimate result, the figures here used for petitioner's 1944 net income and excess profits tax are those which have been used throughout this litigation in the briefs, arguments and opinions. The fact of the matter is that there are in the record three conflicting sets of figures which purport to represent petitioner's net income and excess profits tax in 1944. In one contingency, to be noted below, it becomes important to distinguish between these figures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner filed two returns for 1944, an original return and an amended return. The Commissioner objected to several deductions which were claimed on the amended return and also permitted several deductions not claimed by petitioner on the amended return, thus arriving at a corrected return for 1944 substantially different from either the original or amended return. Throughout the litigation the figure cited for petitioner's 1944 net income, unadjusted to reflect subsequent events, has been $827,852.99. This is in fact the figure which petitioner reported on its original return as its &lt;i&gt;excess profits&lt;/i&gt; net income. The net income figure on the original return was $817,680.90. Petitioner's amended return showed a net income for 1944 of $747,236.60, while correction of petitioner's amended return to reflect errors found by the Commissioner resulted in a figure of $982,836.81.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly the accrued excess profits tax for 1944, unadjusted to reflect subsequent events, has been given as $625,561.59. This is the raw figure which petitioner's original return showed as his tax before certain credits and adjustments which he claimed. That return showed as the excess profits tax due for 1944, $605,561.59. The amended return showed $549,206.15 as the tax due. Because of the fact that at the time the Commissioner corrected the errors in petitioner's amended return he was aware of and took cognizance of the later renegotiation and 1946 carry-back, he did not arrive at what would have been the correct figure for the tax which petitioner should have originally reported as due for 1944 on the basis of facts known at the time the 1944 return was filed. The figure would, however, approximate $770,000.00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When, however, the figures for either the 1944 net income adjusted to reflect renegotiation, or the 1944 excess profits tax after adjustment to reflect renegotiation and loss carry-back, have been given, they are the figures arrived at by the Commissioner ($584,866.81 and $280,540.33 respectively). Since these figures are based not only upon a different return by petitioner, but reflect substantial corrections by the Commissioner of the taxpayer's errors, they are not comparable to the figures which are quoted for unadjusted 1944 net income or excess profits tax. Fortunately for most purposes use of these figures does not affect the conclusion reached on the only question involved here&#151;whether any loss is left to carry back to 1945.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one point at which use of comparable figures does become important. If the figures which have been in general use were comparable, then in our disagreement it would be necessary only to conclude that the unadjusted excess profits tax figure for 1944 ($625,561.59) should be reduced by the amount of tax refunded because of the renegotiation ($318,577.67). Upon application of the formula, subtraction of the resultant excess profits tax figure ($306,983.92) from 1944 net income adjusted to reflect renegotiation ($584,866.81) would give a figure in excess of the 1946 loss carry-back and thus preclude any carry-back to 1945. But if comparable figures are used in applying the formula&#151;it does not matter which of the three sets of figures is used&#151;the reduction in 1944 excess profits tax due merely to renegotiation does not preclude a carry-back to 1945 and thus it is necessary to conclude that the excess profits tax figure for 1944 must also be reduced to reflect the refund resulting from the carry-back to 1944 (approximately $150,000). So reduced, there is no carry-back to 1945.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  This subsection provides that in applying the formula, the figure for net income of 1944 is to be "computed . . . (B) by determining the net operating loss deduction for such second preceding taxable year [1944] without regard to such [the 1946] net operating loss."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued March 30, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided May 23, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*255&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Richard Gladstein&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for Maneja et al. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Norman Leonard.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By invitation of the Court, 348 U. S. 870, &lt;i&gt;Bessie Margolin&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the Secretary of Labor, as &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*256&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae,&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal. With her on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Stuart Rothman&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Harold S. Saxe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Refus G. Poole&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the Waialua Agricultural Co., Ltd. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Livingston Jenks, Milton C. Denbo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Philip Levy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Paul E. Mathias&lt;/i&gt; filed a brief for the American Farm Bureau Federation, as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae,&lt;/i&gt; supporting the Waialua Agricultural Co., Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case involves, primarily, the coverage of the agriculture exemption&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1060, as amended, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 201 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; The petitioners are 31 employees of respondent corporation,&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; which is engaged in the growing, harvesting and processing of sugar cane at its plantation in the Territory of Hawaii. Respondent seeks a declaratory judgment that its operations are exempt from the overtime provisions of the Act, while the petitioners, through a counter-claim under &#167; 16 (b) of the Act, seek to recover unpaid overtime compensation. The action pertains only to work performed between November 20, 1946, and September 14, 1947.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waialua owns and operates what might be called the agricultural analogue of the modern industrial assembly line. On its plantation, consisting of some ten thousand acres of land, it cultivates sugar cane which it processes into raw sugar and molasses. It utilizes the year-round growing season to produce a steady supply of cane and employs in its operations over a thousand persons, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*257&lt;/span&gt; many at specialized tasks. Some move from field to field preparing the soil, fertilizing, planting seed or cultivating. Others attend to the irrigation of the fields. As the cane crop matures, crews of employees move in with mechanical cane harvesters that cut and throw the cane into railroad cars. The cane is then taken over portable tracks laid into the growing fields to Waialua's mainline railroad, which runs throughout the plantation, and from there skilled railroad workers transport the cane to the processing plant. Freshly cut sugar cane is extremely perishable and must be processed within a few days of harvesting or serious spoilage will result. The processing plant is typical of such modern industrial facilities and is manned by employees specially trained in its operation. It has all of the equipment needed to receive the freshly cut cane from the railroad cars and process it into raw sugar and molasses. Adjacent to the processing plant are warehouses where the raw sugar and molasses are stored preparatory to shipment to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tremendous variety of work must be done to keep this enterprise going, and Waialua employs persons versed in each operation. In addition to those employed as indicated above, about a hundred more work in repair shops as mechanics, electricians, welders, carpenters, plumbers and painters. They keep Waialua's highly mechanized enterprise operating, making not only emergency repairs but complete overhauls of the railroad, milling, harvesting and other equipment. Waialua also maintains a plant for the manufacture of concrete products (paving blocks and flumes for irrigation ditches), an electric generating plant in the same building as the mill, and a laboratory for the testing of its soil, water, cane and raw sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to all this, Waialua owns a village where the great majority of its employees live. Known as Waialua &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*258&lt;/span&gt; Village, it was originally built when housing for the employees was inadequate, and is located on plantation property within the limits of the City of Honolulu. Within the town are several hundred houses and business establishments, all occupied on a rental basis, together with recreational areas and other town facilities. The respondent furnishes all the maintenance work for its village, employing street cleaners, road graders and janitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Proceedings Below.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail judge found that all the employees were outside of the agriculture exemption save those engaged directly in agricultural work in the fields, in loading the freshly cut cane into cane cars, and in hauling the loaded cars to the mainline railroad. Those employees working in the sugar mill were found to be under the special processing provisions of &#167; 7 (c) of the Act. As to the other employees, the court entered judgment for overtime as well as liquidated damages and attorney's fees. 97 F. Supp. 198. The Court of Appeals reversed, believing that "the entire cause was tainted by apparent collusion" because stipulations covered the commerce features of the case. It thought that "agriculture is not commerce, interstate or foreign," and that "[f]ederal regulation of agriculture invades the reversed rights of the states. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Butler,&lt;/i&gt; 297 U. S. 1 . . . . But cf., &lt;i&gt;Wickard&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Filburn,&lt;/i&gt; 317 U. S. 111." It indicated, further, that even if the suit were not collusive, the workers would not be entitled to the relief claimed because all of them came within the agriculture exemption of the Act. 216 F. 2d 466 (1954). Despite this reasoning, the Court of Appeals refused to dismiss petitioners' counterclaim but remanded it to the trial court "for proceedings in accordance with this opinion." We granted certiorari, believing &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*259&lt;/span&gt; that the proper administration of the Act requires a resolution of the questions presented. 348 U. S. 870.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in full agreement with the parties that the first ground relied upon by the Court of Appeals is incorrect. It is not necessary now to consider the vitality of &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Butler, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; for that decision expressly reversed the question of whether the regulation of agriculture was within the commerce power,&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wickard&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Filburn, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; decided the question in favor of the congressional power. In view of the fact that Waialua exports virtually its entire output for sale throughout the United States, we find ourselves unable to say that the stipulation with respect to the power of Congress was collusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Scope of the Agriculture Exemption.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress exempted agriculture from the terms of the FLSA in broad, inclusive terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;SEC. 3. "(f) `Agriculture' includes farming in all its branches and among other things includes the cultivation and tillage of the soil, dairying, the production, cultivation, growing, and harvesting of any agricultural or horticultural commodities (including commodities defined as agricultural commodities in section 15 (g) of the Agricultural Marketing Act, as amended), the raising of livestock, bees, fur-bearing animals, or poultry, and any practices (including any forestry or lumbering operations) performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations, including preparation for market, delivery to storage or to market or to carriers for transportation to market."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*260&lt;/span&gt; The exemption was meant to embrace the whole field of agriculture, and sponsors of the legislation so stated, 81 Cong. Rec. 7648, 7658. This Court also has had occasion to comment on its broad coverage. See &lt;i&gt;Addison&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Holly Hill Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 322 U. S. 607, 612 (1944). Nevertheless, no matter how broad the exemption, it was meant to apply only to agriculture and we are left with the problem of what is and what is not properly included within that term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the very beginning of the legislative consideration of the Act, a comprehensive exemption of agricultural labor was a primary consideration of the Congress. Nevertheless, before its final language developed, the agriculture exemption ran the gamut of extensive debates and amendments, each of the latter invariably broadening its scope. Exempting "any person employed in agriculture," its first comprehensive definition declared "farming in all its branches" to be exempt, including "any practices &lt;i&gt;ordinarily&lt;/i&gt; performed by a farmer as an incident to such farming operations." S. 2475, Calendar No. 905, 75th Cong., 1st Sess. 51. Although this language was described by those in charge of the bill in the Senate as "perhaps, the most comprehensive definition of agriculture which has been included in any one legislative proposal," 81 Cong. Rec. 7648, its coverage was broadened until it became coterminous with the sum of those activities necessary in the cultivation of crops, their harvesting, and their "preparation for market, delivery to storage or to market or to carriers for transportation to market." Our main problem is to determine which activities of Waialua come within this definition, thus exempting the persons so employed from the provisions of the Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Railroad Workers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waialua's railroad workers not only haul cane from the fields to the processing plant but also transport farming &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*261&lt;/span&gt; implements and field laborers on the narrow-gauge railway extending throughout the plantation. For numerous reasons, we feel that these employees fall within the comprehensive wording of the agriculture exemption. Nowhere in the Act was any attempt made to draw a distinction between large and small farms or between mechanized and nonmechanized agriculture. In fact, the very opposite appears, since Congress in 1949 specifically refused to draw a distinction between large and small farms similar to the distinctions drawn in the size of newspapers or telephone companies. See H. R. Rep. No. 267, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., p. 24. Compare FLSA, as amended, &#167;&#167; 13 (a) (8), 13 (a) (11), 13 (a) (15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In view of this, we cannot hold that merely because Waialua uses a method ordinarily not associated with agriculture&#151;a railroad&#151;to transport the cane from the fields to the mill, it has forfeited its agriculture exemption. Where a farmer thus uses extraordinary methods, we must look to the function performed. Certainly no one would argue that the agriculture exemption did not apply to farm laborers who took the cane to the plant in wheelbarrows. There is no reason to construe the FLSA so as to discourage modernization in performing this same function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, had Waialua not owned a mill, its transportation activities from field to mill would come squarely within the agriculture exemptions covering "delivery to storage or to market or to carriers for transportation to market." We do not believe the Congress intended to deprive farmers having their own mills of the exemption it afforded farmers who do not. In the debate on the amendment extending exemption to "delivery to market," its sponsor made clear that auxiliary activity of the kind here involved would be included within that term. 81 Cong. Rec. 7888.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*262&lt;/span&gt; Similarly, the exemption clearly covers the transportation of farm implements, supplies and field workers to and from the fields. Being performed "on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations," this activity is a necessary part of the agricultural enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the original administrative interpretation squarely supports our conclusion in regard to such hauling activity,&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; it is insisted that the administrative practice has been to the contrary since &lt;i&gt;Bowie&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gonzalez,&lt;/i&gt; 117 F. 2d 11 (1941). We have examined the press release relied on and find that it stated only that the exemption "does not apply to sugar mill employees, even if the only cane ground in such a mill is cane grown by the sugar mill owner in his own fields," and made no reference to employees engaged in transporting the cane to the mill.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; Subsequent statements by the Administrator merely make the coverage of this activity a question of fact to be determined on an &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt; basis.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; We see no basis for the assertion, therefore, that the administrative practice since 1941 has been to exclude from the exemption the transportation of cane from field to mill. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;Bowie&lt;/i&gt; itself established no such rule, save with regard to the transportation of sugar cane of independent growers. The judgment left all employees transporting sugar cane grown by the mill company in the exempt status. In the subsequent case of &lt;i&gt;Calaf&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gonzalez,&lt;/i&gt; 127 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*263&lt;/span&gt; F. 2d 934 (1942), the same Court of Appeals warned that a different problem would be present if the heart of the transportation system and the situs of the employment of workers were located at the plantation. We do not believe that either &lt;i&gt;Bowie&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Calaf&lt;/i&gt; is apposite. The factual situation here is that Waialua's transportation system is all either in or contiguous to its fields, save the necessary trackage at the mill to accommodate cane cars arriving from various sections of the plantation. The railroad is used exclusively for the effectuation of the agricultural function of transporting exempt agricultural workers to the fields, together with their equipment and supplies, and hauling freshly cut cane to the processing plant. Without it or some other "haul," the land could not be cultivated and the cane, after harvest, would spoil in the fields and be lost. We believe that under the facts here presented the administrative practice also requires that the railroad employees be classified as within the agriculture exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Workers Employed in the Repair Shops.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By a parity of reasoning, those employees who repair the mechanical implements used in farming are also included within the agriculture exemption. Every farmer, big or little, must keep his farming equipment in proper repair, and the fact that Waialua's size has permitted it to achieve an extraordinary degree of specialization should not deprive it of this exemption. Here, the relatively small number of employees assigned to the repair activities&#151;working only on Waialua's machinery and equipment&#151;indicates that, far from being a farmer who conducts a repair business on the side, Waialua is merely performing a subordinate and necessary task incident to its agricultural operations. Indeed, the very necessity of integrating these tasks with Waialua's main operation&#151; without which the entire farming operation would soon &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*264&lt;/span&gt; become hopelessly stalled&#151;is strong reason to consider the repairmen within the exemption. This reasoning, of course, applies only to those employees engaged in the repair of equipment used in performing agricultural functions: tractors, cane loaders, cane cars, and so forth. The repair work on mill equipment is considered under the processing exemption, &lt;i&gt;infra.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Employees in Waialua's Sugar Processing Plant.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislative history of the FLSA indicates that the mill employees present a borderline case. Indeed, this very question, &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; whether the grinding of one's own sugar cane comes within the exemption, was posed and left unresolved in the debates, 81 Cong. Rec. 7657-7658. The sponsors of the Act made clear, however, that "a farmer erecting on his farm a factory and manufacturing anything you please, whether something he grows or not, who employs many people to manufacture it, and then ships it in interstate commerce . . . would not make the manufacturing . . . a farming operation." 81 Cong. Rec. 7658. From this and from discussions of other borderline cases, it is clear that we must look to all the facts surrounding a given process or operation to determine whether it is incident to or in conjunction with farming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In making such a particularized determination, we may consider first the criteria set forth by the Wage-Hour Administrator in 1949, 35 WHM 371, 373. He proposed the following as relevant factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) The size of the ordinary farming operations. There can be no question here that such operations are substantial, and that Waialua's sugar-raising activities are no mere facade for an otherwise industrial venture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) The type of product resulting from the operation in question. Here the products are raw sugar and molasses. There is some ground for considering these as &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*265&lt;/span&gt; strictly agricultural commodities, since the unmilled sugar cane is highly perishable and unmarketable as such. On the other hand, the milling operation transforms sugar cane from its raw and natural state, and there is support in the Senate debates for the view that a process resulting in such a change is more akin to manufacturing than to agriculture. See 81 Cong. Rec. 7659-7660, 7877-7878.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(c) The investment in the processing operation as opposed to the ordinary farming activities. Here the mill accounts for 29% of Waialua's total investment in the plantation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(d) The time spent in processing and in ordinary farming. Waialua's mill operations account for 23% of the man-hours worked during the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(e) The extent to which ordinary farmworkers do processing. There is but slight interchange of workmen. The over-all picture discloses essentially separate working forces for mill operations and for farming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(f) The degree of separation by the employer between the various operations. The plantation organization calls for separate departments to handle the processing activities and field work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(g) The degree of industrialization. The mill workers here, as observed in the &lt;i&gt;Bowie&lt;/i&gt; case, are typical factory workers, and from its external characteristics the milling operation is certainly an industrial venture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in making the factual determination, we must keep in mind that the question here presented is a limited one: is the milling operation part of the agricultural venture? If it is agriculture, albeit industrialized and involving highly specialized mechanical tasks, we must hold it to be within the agriculture exemption. Thus we must add to the factors above some consideration of what is ordinarily done by farmers with regard to this type of operation. It is true that the word "ordinarily" appeared in an earlier version of the exemption and was subsequently &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*266&lt;/span&gt; stricken, but the inquiry is nonetheless a pertinent one. It has a very direct bearing in determining whether the milling operation is really incident to farming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our major domestic sugar-producing areas are in Louisiana, Puerto Rico and Hawaii. Statistics for 1948 reveal that the 5,957 sugar farms in Louisiana have their sugar processed in 47 independent mills and in 12 co-operatives. Marketing Sugarcane in Louisiana (U. S. Dept. Agric. 1949) 1, 23; Agricultural, Manufacturing and Income Statistics for the Domestic Sugar Areas (U. S. Dept. Agric. 1954) 84. While the independent mills own 40% of the cane-producing acreage, there is no indication that these customarily process only the sugar cane grown on their own lands. For the same year, Puerto Rican sugar from 14,772 farms was processed in 35 "centrals." The Marketing of Sugarcane in Puerto Rico (U. S. Dept. Agric. 1950) 2; Agricultural, Manufacturing and Income Statistics for the Domestic Sugar Areas, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 121. Again the practice is not for the individual farmer to grind his own sugar. The statistics for Hawaii disclose only 34 and 30 farms for 1947 and 1948 respectively. But these low figures resulted from a classification which counted only the "plantations." When smaller independent farms were included in the 1951 figures, the number of Hawaiian sugar farms jumped to 786. Agricultural, Manufacturing and Income Statistics for the Domestic Sugar Areas, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 137. In addition, there are some 1,500 or 1,800 small "adherent planters" producing sugar cane in Hawaii. See Hearings before the House Committee on Education and Labor on H. R. 2033, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1173. According to information furnished by the Sugar Division of the United States Department of Agriculture, there are about twenty-six sugar mills in Hawaii processing cane produced by all these farmers. Ten of these, like Waialua, are engaged exclusively in the processing of their own cane; the remaining &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*267&lt;/span&gt; sixteen process cane grown by others as well as their own.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; The pertinent ratio, however, is not the proportion of millers who grow their own cane but the percentage of farmers who engage in milling. Thus, while sugar milling by farmers is more prevalent in Hawaii than in the other sugar-producing areas, it is very doubtful that these milling operations can be considered a normal incident to the cultivation of sugar cane, even in the context of the Hawaiian sugar industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a consideration of all the relevant factors, the question would be an extremely close one in gauging whether this milling operation is farming or manufacturing. But we do not stop here. The status under the FLSA of farmers milling their own sugar is influenced by a number of extraneous legislative factors&#151;their position &lt;i&gt;vis-a-vis&lt;/i&gt; the agriculture exemption may well be &lt;i&gt;sui generis.&lt;/i&gt; Some time after the inconclusive floor debate on sugar processing, there was included in &#167; 7 (c) a total exemption of this activity from the overtime provisions of the Act. This may well have been considered a satisfactory answer to the difficult problems posed in determining whether sugar processing came within the agriculture exemption. But we cannot be sure of this, because &#167; 7 (c) includes similar exemptions for operations like cotton ginning, which also come within the agriculture exemption if performed by the farmer on his own crops. More significant is the &lt;i&gt;omission&lt;/i&gt; of sugar milling from the exemption provided by &#167; 13 (a) (10) for various processing operations performed within the area of production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*268&lt;/span&gt; This exemption was designed to meet the protests of many legislators who argued that the broad agriculture exemption permitted large farming units to process their own products without subjecting themselves to the terms of the Act, while the small farmer, who did not have the equipment necessary for such processing, had to bear the cost of operations covered by the Act. Section 13 (a) (10) exempted employees "within the area of production . . . engaged in handling, packing, storing, ginning, compressing, pasteurizing, drying, preparing in their raw or natural state, or canning of agricultural or horticultural commodities for market." Thus, for example, the cotton farmer without a gin was placed on an equal footing with farmers who ginned their own cotton, since each could have their cotton ginned by employees who were covered by neither the wage nor the hour provisions of the Act. But sugar milling is not included within the "area of production" exemption, since in the course of this processing the sugar cane is changed from its "raw or natural state." See 35 WHM 365. Senator Schwellenbach, one of the most ardent advocates of equalization in the status of large and small farmers, considered this change in the product as marking the dividing line between processing as an agricultural function and processing as a manufacturing operation. See 81 Cong. Rec. 7659-7660, 7877-7879. The "area of production" exemption reflects this dichotomy. Thus all other forms of quasi-industrial processing&#151;ginning, canning, packing, etc.&#151;which might be used as analogies for including sugar milling within the agriculture exemption are repeated in &#167; 13 (a) (10). Congress would not have omitted sugar milling from the "area of production" exemption if it had not concluded that it also fell outside the agriculture exemption. We think that adherence to the congressional scheme requires us to hold that sugar milling is outside the agriculture exemption and that its &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*269&lt;/span&gt; exemption from the hours provision by virtue of &#167; 7 (c) marks the outer limit of congressional concession to this type of processing. By so holding, we not only equalize the status of all sugar farmers with regard to FLSA coverage of milling operations on their product, but we equalize the impact of the Act on all sugar mills, those which grind their own cane and those grinding their neighbors' as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We note, further, that such an interpretation closes a gap that would otherwise exist in the federal &lt;i&gt;wage&lt;/i&gt; regulation of persons engaged in producing sugar for interstate commerce. The FLSA clearly reaches those engaged in refining sugar, cf. FLSA &#167; 7 (c), and the Sugar Act provides for reasonable wages for those engaged in the "production, cultivation, or harvesting" of sugar cane. 50 Stat. 909, 61 Stat. 930, 7 U. S. C. &#167; 1131. The latter terminology has been construed to extend to the mainline railroad workers, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 7 CFR, 1941 Supp., &#167; 802.34d, leaving unregulated only the wages of sugar-mill employees &#151;unless, as we hold here, these factory workers are beyond the terms of the agriculture exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waialua makes much of the fact that the Administrator originally construed the agriculture exemption as covering the grinding of the farmer's own sugar cane. Interpretative Bulletin No. 14, &lt;i&gt;supra.&lt;/i&gt; The Administrator revised his construction in 1941 to accord with his interpretation of several cases in the First Circuit dealing with the Puerto Rican sugar industry, and from that time he has maintained that sugar milling is not exempt, even if the farmer is engaged exclusively in the milling of his own cane. See Press Release, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at note 5. The revised construction of the Administrator&#151;and the fact that farmers milling their own sugar cane were covered only by &#167; 7 (c)&#151;were reported to the congressional committees considering amendments to the FLSA. See Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*270&lt;/span&gt; Education and Labor on S. 1349, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 1049-1050; Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare on S. 49 &lt;i&gt;et al.,&lt;/i&gt; 80th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 318; Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare on S. 58 &lt;i&gt;et al.,&lt;/i&gt; 81st Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 973-974; Hearings before the House Committee on Education and Labor on H. R. 2033, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1166. But when the Act was amended in 1949 Congress did not overrule this interpretation. It provided instead that any "order, regulation, or interpretation of the Administrator" in effect on the effective date of the 1949 amendments "shall remain in effect . . . except to the extent that any such order, regulation, interpretation . . . may be inconsistent with the provisions of this Act . . . ." 63 Stat. 920. We relied on this section in &lt;i&gt;Alstate Construction Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Durkin,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 13, in upholding a regulation of the Administrator which similarly had been changed, reported to Congress in its revised form, and left unaltered by the 1949 Act. We come to the same conclusion in this case, and hold the Administrator's interpretation unimpaired by the 1949 Amendments. It therefore follows that the employees working in the processing plant are not within the agriculture exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Processing Exemption.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the mill workers are not within the agriculture exemption, they are nevertheless exempt from the overtime provisions of the Act. Section 7 (c) specifically provides that the overtime provisions of the Act shall not apply to "an employer engaged in the . . . processing of . . . sugarcane . . . into sugar (but not refined sugar)," and this exemption extends to "employees in any place of employment [where the processing is carried on]." This, we feel, covers the workmen during the processing &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*271&lt;/span&gt; season while making emergency repairs in the mill, cleaning the equipment during the week-end shutdown, and performing other tasks closely and intimately connected with the processing operation. Repair work on the mill equipment in Waialua's shops in the mill area is also within the exemption. See 35 WHM 360-361. During the three-month off-season, however, a complete overhaul and reconditioning is given the entire mill equipment and no processing work is performed. Since &#167; 7 (c) on its face covers only those employees who work in the place of employment where the processor &lt;i&gt;is so engaged,&lt;/i&gt; we cannot extend its coverage to include within the overtime exemption permanent repairs, overhaul and reconditioning during this three-month off-season. See &lt;i&gt;Heaburg&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Independent Oil Mill,&lt;/i&gt; 46 F. Supp. 751; &lt;i&gt;Abram&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;San Joaquin Cotton Oil Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 49 F. Supp. 393. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Mitchell&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Stinson,&lt;/i&gt; 217 F. 2d 210, 217 (C. A. 1st Cir.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Waialua Village Workers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now come to those workers employed in the maintenance of Waialua Village. This village seems to be an ordinary town, except for the fact that Waialua performs the usual civic functions. It rents its dwelling houses to employees and others on a purely voluntary basis. In fact, the adjacent Haleiwa Village, not owned by Waialua, houses some of the employees. Under the 1949 Amendments to the Act, the work of the employees in maintaining the town clearly is not covered. 63 Stat. 911, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 203 (j). The question presented in this case, therefore, is of small import in itself. Even so, to come within the coverage of the Act prior to this amendment, the activity of such employees must have a "close and immediate tie with the process of production." &lt;i&gt;Kirschbaum Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Walling,&lt;/i&gt; 316 U. S. 517, 525. We do not &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*272&lt;/span&gt; believe such a tenuous relation as here established is sufficient. This activity is sufficiently regulated by the requirements of Hawaiian law. Revised Laws of Hawaii, 1945, Title 9, Ch. 75, &#167;&#167; 4351-4366. Congress made it clear that it intended to "leave local business to the protection of the states," &lt;i&gt;Walling&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jacksonville Paper Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 317 U. S. 564, 570, and "did not see fit . . . to exhaust its constitutional power over commerce," &lt;i&gt;10 East 40th St. Bldg.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Callus,&lt;/i&gt; 325 U. S. 578, 579. For these reasons, we believe that the employees working in the maintenance of the village and the repair of the respondent's dwelling houses are not covered by the provisions of the Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In view of the state of the record, we are unable to determine the rights of the remaining employees involved in this litigation. We do not have sufficient data to decide whether the employees in the laboratory, the cement products plant and the power plant are within the agriculture or sugar-processing exemption. On remand, the problems arising in those operations&#151;small though they be in the over-all picture&#151;may be decided in the light of the considerations set down in this opinion. Likewise, the trial court may make any necessary reassessment in overtime compensation due employees. The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed and remanded.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BURTON, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Waialua Agricultural Company performs the closely integrated function not merely of growing, harvesting and gathering sugar cane from its fields, but of promptly processing that cumbersome, perishable crop &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*273&lt;/span&gt; into transportable, marketable raw sugar and molasses. If not so processed, the cane spoils. The processing, therefore, is as essential to the success of the sugar cane plantation as the growing and harvesting of the cane itself. The question before us is the extent to which the employees of Waialua are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress, in so many words, has excluded from the coverage of the Act &lt;i&gt;"any employee employed in agriculture."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; (Italics supplied.) It has clarified this exemption by adding that&#151;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;" `Agriculture' includes &lt;i&gt;farming in all its branches&lt;/i&gt; and among other things includes the cultivation and tillage of the soil . . . the production, cultivation, &lt;i&gt;growing, and harvesting of any agricultural or horticultural commodities . . . and any practices . . . performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations, including preparation for market, delivery to storage or to market or to carriers for transportation to market.&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; (Italics supplied.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my view, the above definition includes all of the operations of the Waialua Agricultural Company.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; It is difficult to conceive of terms covering them more adequately. Concededly, the company is a "farmer," and each of the practices involved here readily can be conceived of as being performed by it on its farm as an incident to or in conjunction with growing, harvesting and preparing its sugar cane for market or for delivery to carriers for transportation to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*274&lt;/span&gt; The Court goes far toward adopting the above view. By applying the agricultural exemption to Waialua's employees who grow or harvest the sugar cane, and to those who deliver the cane to the processing mill, the Court completely relieves Waialua of the wage and hour requirements of the Act in relation to those employees. On the other hand, the Court declines to apply the agricultural exemption to Waialua's processing employees. The consequence of this is minimized by two factors. First, the resulting subjection of Waialua to the minimum wage requirements of the Act adds no burden because Waialua, of its own accord, pays its processing employees more than the required minimum. Secondly, any burden due to the resulting subjection of Waialua to the statutory 40-hour week, with increased pay for overtime, is not great, because &#167; 7 (c)&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; specifically grants exemption from such regulation to "employees in any place of employment where" the employer is engaged in processing sugar cane into raw sugar or syrup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the processing exemption, under &#167; 7 (c), is not the full equivalent of the agricultural exemption under &#167;&#167; 13 (a) (6) and 3 (f). The exemption under &#167; 7 (c) is limited to the overtime provisions of the Act and does not extend to the minimum wage provisions. It is construed to cover only tasks that are "closely and intimately connected" with the actual processing of sugar cane in a mill, whereas the agricultural exemption is not so restricted. The Court makes this clear. Section 7 (c) is held by it not to reach services performed by Waialua's processing employees in the mill during the "off season" when no cane is actually being processed there. Still other areas of uncertainty appear where the Court requires further findings as to the work done in the laboratory, the concrete products plant and the power plant &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*275&lt;/span&gt; before determining the status of employees engaged in those operations.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the agricultural exemption be given the broad application to which I believe it entitled, no line need be drawn between processing and other agricultural activities. Each of the above activities would be exempt because each is "incident to or [is performed] in conjunction with" the agricultural operation of growing, harvesting, preparing and delivering the cane to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court recognizes that the large size of Waialua's plantation makes necessary the specialization of labor incidental to its sugar cane production and marketing. Mere size and mechanization of Waialua's farming operations are not, in themselves, grounds for excluding any of its employees from the agricultural exemption. As I see it, the statutory definition of agriculture describes a major activity which lies beyond the outer limits of the Fair Labor Standards Act. "Agriculture" is not an exception carved out of the jurisdiction of the Act. Congress never proposed to apply the Act to agriculture. To any extent that the Act impinges upon agricultural &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*276&lt;/span&gt; activities, those impingements are themselves exceptions to the general freedom that characterizes agricultural employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislative history supports an all-inclusive, rather than a restrictive, interpretation of the word "agriculture" as used here. When Senate Bill 2475, which became the Fair Labor Standards Act, was reported favorably by the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, it exempted "any person employed in agriculture." It provided that as "used in this Act, the term `agriculture' includes &lt;i&gt;farming in all its branches&lt;/i&gt; and . . . any practices &lt;i&gt;ordinarily&lt;/i&gt; performed by a farmer as an incident to such farming operations." (Italics supplied.) &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; Calendar No. 905, 75th Cong., 1st Sess. 51. Congress proposed thereby to exempt "persons engaged in agriculture &lt;i&gt;and such processing of agricultural commodities&lt;/i&gt; as is &lt;i&gt;ordinarily&lt;/i&gt; performed by farmers as an incident of farm operations." (Italics supplied.) S. Rep. No. 884, 75th Cong., 1st Sess. 6. The exemption was thus expressly made applicable at least to the &lt;i&gt;ordinary processing&lt;/i&gt; of agricultural commodities while converting them from their natural state to a marketable form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ensuing debate, attention was directed specifically to sugar cane. In answer to whether syrup mills, operated on sugar cane plantations, would be exempt, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Education and Labor stated that "If . . . it is a practice &lt;i&gt;not ordinarily&lt;/i&gt; performed by a farmer as incident to his farming operations. . . [it] would &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; come under the definition." (Italics supplied.) 81 Cong. Rec. 7657. However, this restriction of the agricultural exemption significantly disappeared when the word "ordinarily" was intentionally stricken out of the definition of agriculture. H. R. Rep. No. 1452, 75th Cong., 1st Sess. 11. In its final stage, "agriculture" became substantially all-inclusive. It covered "any practices performed by a farmer or on a farm &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*277&lt;/span&gt; as an incident to such farming operations, including preparation for market, delivery to storage or to market or to carriers for transportation to market." S. 2475, Union Calendar No. 804, 75th Cong., 3d Sess. 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emphasis thus was shifted from &lt;i&gt;ordinary&lt;/i&gt; practices incident to farming operations to &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; practices incident to farming operations, including those incident to the preparation or delivery of agricultural products to storage or to market. Operations, such as those of a shirt factory on a cotton farm, are said to be excluded from the agricultural exemption, not because they are not ordinarily operated by farmers, but because they are neither incident to farming operations nor appropriate to the preparation of a farm product for its initial market. Accordingly, the essential inquiry in the instant case is whether Waialua's processing of sugar cane is incident to farming operations, including those necessary or appropriate to prepare the cane product for storage or for its market. The answer should be that harvested sugar cane is so highly perishable that it must be processed promptly in order to be either stored or marketed. It naturally follows, therefore, that such processing, done by a farmer on a farm, should be recognized as "agriculture" equally with the growing and harvesting of the crop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emphasizing this view, in 1939, the Department of Labor issued Interpretative Bulletin No. 14. It then said unequivocally that the words "preparation for market" included the processing of sugar cane into raw sugar and molasses. It classified that operation with cotton ginning and the packing or canning of other agricultural commodities. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; &#167; 10 (b), 35 Wage and Hour Man. 351, 355.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; Being substantially contemporaneous with the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*278&lt;/span&gt; Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, such an initial interpretation of the statute is entitled to special weight. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Trucking Assns.,&lt;/i&gt; 310 U. S. 534, 549.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Court suggests that &#167; 7 (c) lends support to its conclusion that the agricultural exemption does not apply to processing operations, I believe that the presence of &#167; 7 (c) supports the opposite conclusion. Section 7 (c) was inserted in the bill largely in answer to the argument that the agricultural exemption (in &#167;&#167; 13 (a) (6) and 3 (f)) would relieve the large processing farmers from the restrictions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and thus help them market their raw sugar or molasses more cheaply than the smaller farmers who would be compelled to employ nonexempt independent processors. Section 7 (c), accordingly, was added to relieve such independent &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*279&lt;/span&gt; processors from the overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act in tacit recognition of the existing exemption of the processing farmers under the agricultural exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &#167; 13 (a) (10),&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; Congress similarly exempted from the wage and hour provisions of the Act all employees "&lt;i&gt;within the area of production&lt;/i&gt; . . . engaged in handling, packing, storing, ginning, compressing, pasteurizing, drying, preparing in their raw or natural state, or canning of agricultural or horticultural commodities for market . . . ." (Italics supplied.) It is argued that, by failing to list sugar cane processing specifically in &#167; 13 (a) (10), Congress implies that the general agricultural exemption is not applicable to sugar cane processing. No such conclusion is justified. Section 13 (a) (10) was added late in the legislative development of the bill, not to restrict existing exemptions, but to create further exemptions. It was added in order to exempt the activities of packers, ginners and others providing service anywhere "within the area of production." If &#167; 13 (a) (10) had listed sugar cane processing, it would have extended the minimum wage exemption to independent processors throughout surrounding areas of production. To do so was entirely optional with Congress and its mere failure to do so implies no purpose, &lt;i&gt;sub silentio,&lt;/i&gt; to reduce the scope of the agricultural exemption already extended, in positive and sweeping terms, in response to an insistent demand for the exemption of all farming operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, while I concur in reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals and in the application of the agricultural exemption to the extent that it is applied by this Court, I would remand the entire cause to the District Court with a direction to enter judgment in favor of the Waialua Agricultural Company in accordance with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[5]  In the laboratory, Waialua employs, in a separate building, 14 chemists, testers and samplers who analyze cane leaf, juice, fiber and ash, raw sugar and molasses, water used in all operations, etc., so as to have all operations controlled by scientific methods. In the concrete products plant, it employs, in a separate building, four to ten men primarily making irrigation flumes and water supply pipe. Other products include concrete blocks, footings and sidewalk slabs required on the plantation. Cement and other materials used in making these products are purchased off the plantation. For the power plant, the "bagasse," or cane fiber remaining after the extraction of its juice, supplies fuel. Waialua burns it to produce steam which drives mill machinery, heats sugar juice and generates electric power. The electric power, in turn, serves various operations on the plantation. The integrated nature of these operations emphasizes the propriety and practicality of the blanket agricultural exemption in relation to them. It demonstrates also the difficulty of drawing lines between such naturally related operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  It appears that the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division later withdraw from that position in deference to a decision in 1941 by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in &lt;i&gt;Bowie&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gonzalez,&lt;/i&gt; 117 F. 2d 11. That court there held that certain processors who processed sugar cane, &lt;i&gt;other than their own,&lt;/i&gt; did not come within the agricultural exemption. The Administrator, in concluding that the processing of sugar cane by a farmer on his own farm, in his own plant, also was to be excluded from the agricultural exemption, extended the decision beyond the point at issue. See &lt;i&gt;Farmers Irrigation Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McComb,&lt;/i&gt; 337 U. S. 755, 766-767, n. 15.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not attach significance to the failure of Congress to make specific reference to this point in its 1949 amendments. By its savings clause, Congress reserved the issue of the validity of the Administrator's interpretation of the Act. It did this by providing generally that existing interpretations of the Administrator remain in effect but expressly excepting "the extent that any such . . . interpretation. . . may be inconsistent with the provisions of this Act . . . ." 63 Stat. 920. The pendency of the instant litigation at that time was called to the attention of the appropriate Committee of Congress and it was shown that the Administrator had not instituted that suit, or any other, in reliance upon the interpretation now claimed. Hearings before House Committee on Education and Labor on H. R. 2033, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 1165-1169. To use the 1949 savings clause as confirming the consistency, with the statute, of the Administrator's interpretation is to assume that very consistency in order to establish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  52 Stat. 1067, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 213 (a) (10).&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF CLAIMS.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Assistant Attorney General Holland&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Ellis N. Slack, Ralph S. Spritzer, Lee A. Jackson&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;I. Henry Kutz.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fred R. Tansill&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Eugene Meacham. William H. Krieg&lt;/i&gt; entered an appearance for respondent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*233&lt;/span&gt; MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suit was brought in the Court of Claims for a tax refund. The taxpayer, a New York corporation, kept its books and accounts on the accrual basis and filed its federal income tax returns on the same basis, using the calendar year. The taxpayer had a net operating loss of $310,872.60 for 1946. This loss was carried back and set off against the taxpayer's excess profits net income for 1944, and its excess profits tax for 1944 was adjusted accordingly. That carry-back was authorized by the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, &#167; 122; and it is not in controversy here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taxpayer reported an excess profits tax liability of $346,643.22 for 1945. In 1946 the taxpayer paid $263,272.80 in excess profits taxes for 1945. It contends that that amount, paid in 1946, should have been added to the net operating loss of $310,872.60 for that year and that the sum of those figures, instead of $310,872.60, should have been carried back to 1944 as a net operating loss. If that should have been done, the United States would now owe the taxpayer the refund claimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Claims, by a divided vote, sustained the taxpayer's contention and held that, in computing its net operating loss for 1946, the taxpayer was entitled to include the amount of excess profits tax paid in 1946 on account of its 1945 return. Judgment was accordingly entered for the taxpayer. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;124&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ct. Cl.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 39, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;108&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;109&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 110 F. Supp. 600. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted (348 U. S. 808) because of a conflict between the decision below and &lt;i&gt;Lewyt Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 215 F. 2d 518, decided by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 23 (s) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that, in computing net income, "the net operating loss &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*234&lt;/span&gt; deduction computed under section 122" shall be allowed as a deduction. Section 122, as applicable here, provides a complicated formula for carrying net operating losses back for two preceding taxable years and over into the two succeeding taxable years, thus taking for the limited purpose of &#167; 122 a five-year period as the accounting unit. The part of &#167; 122 of which the taxpayer seeks to take advantage is (b) (1) relating to the carry-back.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; By the express terms of &#167; 122 (b) (1) the carry-back provisions are subject to the limitations contained in &#167; 122 (d) (6), which provides in part, "There shall be allowed as a deduction the amount of tax imposed by Subchapter E of Chapter 2 paid or accrued within the taxable year . . . ." Subchapter E of Chapter 2 identifies the tax which may be used as a deduction as the Excess Profits Tax. But if it is to be used as a deduction, the tax must have been "paid or accrued" within the taxable year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy here revolves around the meaning of "paid or accrued." The years 1944 and 1945 were years of profit for the taxpayer. The years 1946 and 1947 were years of loss. The taxpayer kept its books and filed its returns on the accrual basis of accounting. Its 1945 excess profits tax therefore accrued in 1945, though it was paid in 1946. Yet the argument which prevailed below &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*235&lt;/span&gt; is that the tax paid in 1946 on account of the liability for 1945 could be used under &#167; 122 (d) (6) as a net operating loss for 1946. We take the other view and conclude that &#167; 122 (d) (6) does not grant a taxpayer an option to take deductions on a basis that is inconsistent with the method of accounting which it employs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 41 states the general rule that net income shall be computed "in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the books" of the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 43 provides that deductions and credits may be taken "for the taxable year in which `paid or accrued' or `paid or incurred,' dependent upon the method of accounting upon the basis of which the net income is computed, unless in order to clearly reflect the income the deductions or credits should be taken as of a different period."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 48 provides, "When used in this chapter . . . (c) The terms . . . `paid or accrued' shall be construed according to the method of accounting upon the basis of which the net income is computed under this Part." This provision of &#167; 48 would itself seem to be conclusive of the question, since &#167; 122 is "in this chapter," to use the language of &#167; 48. And &#167; 48, together with &#167; 41 and &#167; 43, seem to indicate that the words "paid or accrued" have only one meaning throughout the chapter, not the changeable meaning which the taxpayer seeks to give them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We deal here with a deduction which one obtains not as of right, but as of grace. &lt;i&gt;Deputy&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;du Pont,&lt;/i&gt; 308 U. S. 488, 493. The taxpayer has the burden to show that it is within the provision allowing the deduction. But the effort here made, if successful, would cause "paid or accrued," as used in &#167; 122 (d) (6), to mean something different than it does in other sections of the same chapter; and that would fly in the face of the express command of &#167; 48.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*236&lt;/span&gt; The Court of Claims recognized the force of this analysis, but concluded that Congress could not have meant what it said because, if so, this particular carry-back provision would have little application. First, most corporations are on the accrual not the cash basis. Second, if an accrual taxpayer is limited in its deductions to excess profits taxes accrued within the taxable year, the provision has little value since there is "rarely a case when a taxpayer would be liable for any excess profits tax in a year in which it had sustained a net operating loss . . . ." 124 Ct. Cl., at 37, 108 F. Supp., at 111. This taxpayer argues the inequity of the results which would follow from our construction of the Code. But as we have said before, "general equitable considerations" do not control the question of what deductions are permissible. &lt;i&gt;Deputy&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;du Pont, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 493. It may be that Congress granted less than some thought or less than was originally intended. We can only take the Code as we find it and give it as great an internal symmetry and consistency as its words permit. We would not be faithful to the statutory scheme, as revealed by the words employed, if we gave "paid or accrued" a different meaning for the purposes of &#167; 122 (d) (6) than it has in the other parts of the same chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our construction is in harmony with the general rule that a taxpayer on an accrual basis must take deductions in the year of accrual. See &lt;i&gt;Security Mills Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 321 U. S. 281.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the construction we feel compelled to make favors the taxpayer on the cash basis and discriminates against the taxpayer on the accrual basis may suggest that changes in the law are desirable. But if they are to be made, Congress must make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]  Section 122 (b) (1) is entitled "Net operating loss carry-back" and reads as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1941, the taxpayer has a net operating loss, such net operating loss shall be a net operating loss carry-back for each of the two preceding taxable years, except that the carry-back in the case of the first preceding taxable year shall be the excess, if any, of the amount of such net operating loss over the net income for the second preceding taxable year computed (A) with the exceptions, additions, and limitations provided in subsection (d) (1), (2), (4), and (6), and (B) by determining the net operating loss deduction for such second preceding taxable year without regard to such net operating loss."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*298&lt;/span&gt; MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cases were decided on May 17, 1954. The opinions of that date,&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; declaring the fundamental principle that racial discrimination in public education is unconstitutional, are incorporated herein by reference. All provisions of federal, state, or local law requiring or permitting such discrimination must yield to this principle. There remains for consideration the manner in which relief is to be accorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because these cases arose under different local conditions and their disposition will involve a variety of local problems, we requested further argument on the question of relief.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; In view of the nationwide importance of the decision, we invited the Attorney General of the United &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*299&lt;/span&gt; States and the Attorneys General of all states requiring or permitting racial discrimination in public education to present their views on that question. The parties, the United States, and the States of Florida, North Carolina, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Maryland, and Texas filed briefs and participated in the oral argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These presentations were informative and helpful to the Court in its consideration of the complexities arising from the transition to a system of public education freed of racial discrimination. The presentations also demonstrated that substantial steps to eliminate racial discrimination in public schools have already been taken, not only in some of the communities in which these cases arose, but in some of the states appearing as &lt;i&gt;amici curiae,&lt;/i&gt; and in other states as well. Substantial progress has been made in the District of Columbia and in the communities in Kansas and Delaware involved in this litigation. The defendants in the cases coming to us from South Carolina and Virginia are awaiting the decision of this Court concerning relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full implementation of these constitutional principles may require solution of varied local school problems. School authorities have the primary responsibility for elucidating, assessing, and solving these problems; courts will have to consider whether the action of school authorities constitutes good faith implementation of the governing constitutional principles. Because of their proximity to local conditions and the possible need for further hearings, the courts which originally heard these cases can best perform this judicial appraisal. Accordingly, we believe it appropriate to remand the cases to those courts.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*300&lt;/span&gt; In fashioning and effectuating the decrees, the courts will be guided by equitable principles. Traditionally, equity has been characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping its remedies&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; and by a facility for adjusting and reconciling public and private needs.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; These cases call for the exercise of these traditional attributes of equity power. At stake is the personal interest of the plaintiffs in admission to public schools as soon as practicable on a nondiscriminatory basis. To effectuate this interest may call for elimination of a variety of obstacles in making the transition to school systems operated in accordance with the constitutional principles set forth in our May 17, 1954, decision. Courts of equity may properly take into account the public interest in the elimination of such obstacles in a systematic and effective manner. But it should go without saying that the vitality of these constitutional principles cannot be allowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While giving weight to these public and private considerations, the courts will require that the defendants make a prompt and reasonable start toward full compliance with our May 17, 1954, ruling. Once such a start has been made, the courts may find that additional time is necessary to carry out the ruling in an effective manner. The burden rests upon the defendants to establish that such time is necessary in the public interest and is consistent with good faith compliance at the earliest practicable date. To that end, the courts may consider problems related to administration, arising from the physical condition of the school plant, the school transportation system, personnel, revision of school districts and attendance areas into compact units to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*301&lt;/span&gt; on a nonracial basis, and revision of local laws and regulations which may be necessary in solving the foregoing problems. They will also consider the adequacy of any plans the defendants may propose to meet these problems and to effectuate a transition to a racially nondiscriminatory school system. During this period of transition, the courts will retain jurisdiction of these cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgments below, except that in the Delaware case, are accordingly reversed and the cases are remanded to the District Courts to take such proceedings and enter such orders and decrees consistent with this opinion as are necessary and proper to admit to public schools on a racially nondiscriminatory basis with all deliberate speed the parties to these cases. The judgment in the Delaware case&#151;ordering the immediate admission of the plaintiffs to schools previously attended only by white children&#151;is affirmed on the basis of the principles stated in our May 17, 1954, opinion, but the case is remanded to the Supreme Court of Delaware for such further proceedings as that Court may deem necessary in light of this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2]  Further argument was requested on the following questions, 347 U. S. 483, 495-496, n. 13, previously propounded by the Court:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"4. Assuming it is decided that segregation in public schools violates the Fourteenth Amendment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;) would a decree necessarily follow providing that, within the limits set by normal geographic school districting, Negro children should forthwith be admitted to schools of their choice, or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;) may this Court, in the exercise of its equity powers, permit an effective gradual adjustment to be brought about from existing segregated systems to a system not based on color distinctions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"5. On the assumption on which questions 4 (&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;) and (&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;) are based, and assuming further that this Court will exercise its equity powers to the end described in question 4 (&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;) should this Court formulate detailed decrees in these cases;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;) if so, what specific issues should the decrees reach;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;) should this Court appoint a special master to hear evidence with a view to recommending specific terms for such decrees;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;) should this Court remand to the courts of first instance with directions to frame decrees in these cases, and if so what general directions should the decrees of this Court include and what procedures should the courts of first instance follow in arriving at the specific terms of more detailed decrees?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  The cases coming to us from Kansas, South Carolina, and Virginia were originally heard by three-judge District Courts convened under 28 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 2281 and 2284.

&lt;center&gt;No. 145.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued April 21-22, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided May 31, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jack Wasserman&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;David Carliner&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*303&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Robert W. Ginnane&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Maurice A. Roberts&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L. Paul Winings.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner, a native of Tunis, Africa, was ordered deported after a hearing pursuant to &#167; 242 (b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 209, 8 U. S. C. &#167; 1252 (b). It was found that he had been convicted in 1938 of violation of the Marihuana Tax Act, 26 U. S. C. &#167; 2591, and sentenced to imprisonment for one year. Section 241 (a) (11) of the 1952 immigration law&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; makes such conviction &lt;i&gt;at any time&lt;/i&gt; ground for deportation, and &#167; 241 (d)&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; provides that the deportation provisions of &#167; 241 (a) shall apply even though the facts giving rise to the alien's deportability occurred prior to the date of enactment of the 1952 Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the hearing before a special inquiry officer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, petitioner did not dispute the fact of his conviction. He did, however, object to the proceedings on the ground that they violated due process and the Administrative Procedure Act, 60 Stat. 237, 5 U. S. C. &#167; 1001 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; The hearing officer overruled these objections. Petitioner also contended that the &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; clause of the Constitution precluded the retroactive application of the 1952 law to his case. This contention too was rejected by the hearing officer. Petitioner and his counsel were advised of their right to apply to the Attorney General for the discretionary relief of suspension of deportation under &#167; 244 (a) (5) of the Act.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; At first they declined to do so, but subsequently &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*304&lt;/span&gt; they moved to reopen the hearing to apply for such relief. The special inquiry officer denied the motion. On appeal, the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the order of deportation. Though no formal application for suspension of deportation under &#167; 244 (a) (5) had been filed, the Board considered whether such relief was merited but exercised its discretion against the remission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner then brought this action for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging the validity of the deportation order on the grounds, &lt;i&gt;inter alia:&lt;/i&gt; (1) that the hearing under &#167; 242 (b) of the Act failed to comply with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act in that the special inquiry officer was under the supervision and control of officials in the Immigration Service who performed investigative and prosecuting functions; (2) that &#167; 242 (b) violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it failed to provide for a fair and impartial hearing; (3) that on the date of petitioner's arrest the Attorney General made a public statement, which "was bound to have great effect upon the special inquiry officer," to the effect that petitioner was an undesirable citizen for whose deportation the proceedings were "specially designed," and, further, that in 1952 the Attorney General "prepared a list of 152 persons [including petitioner] whom he desired to deport"; and (4) that the retroactive application of &#167; 241 (a) (11) was unconstitutional as an &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government's return to the writ alleged that petitioner's deportation had been conducted in accordance with the Constitution, laws and regulations of the United States. No evidence was introduced by either side save the official Immigration Service record of petitioner's deportation proceedings. The District Court held the deportation order valid and discharged the writ. 113 F. Supp. 22. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 212 F. 2d 830. Petitioner pursues his four basic objections in this &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*305&lt;/span&gt; Court, certiorari having been granted to resolve issues having a significant bearing on the administration of our immigration laws. 348 U. S. 805.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Applicability of the Administrative Procedure Act.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner concedes that &#167; 242 (b) of the Immigration Act, authorizing the appointment of a "special inquiry officer" to preside at the deportation Proceedings, does not conflict with the Administrative Procedure Act, since &#167; 7 (a) of that Act excepts from its terms officers specially provided for or designated pursuant to other statutes.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; He insists, however, that there are several significant discrepancies between the Acts, and claims that in cases of variance the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act must govern unless those of the Immigration Act "shall . . . expressly" negate their application. Administrative Procedure Act, &#167; 12. The discrepancies relied on stem from the "separation of functions" provision of &#167; 5 (c) of the Administrative Procedure Act. To the extent here material, this section separates investigative and prosecuting functions from those of adjudication, expressly providing that hearing officers shall not be responsible to or under the supervision of those engaged in investigation and prosecution. The section also prohibits the hearing officer from participating or advising in the decision of a case, or one factually related thereto, in which he has performed investigative or prosecuting functions. Section 242 (b) of the Immigration Act, on the other hand, permits the "special inquiry officer" to take the dual role of prosecutor and hearing officer&#151;presenting evidence and interrogating witnesses&#151;and prohibits him only from hearing cases which he has taken some part in investigating &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*306&lt;/span&gt; or prosecuting (other than in the permitted dual capacity). An alternative method is permitted by &#167; 242 (b), however, under which an additional immigration officer presents the evidence while the special inquiry officer presides. See 8 CFR &#167; 242.53. Special inquiry officers are subject to such supervision as the Attorney General prescribes, 66 Stat. 171, 8 U. S. C. &#167; 1101 (b) (4), and at present they are subject to the supervision of district directors of the immigration districts to which they are assigned, as well as higher Service officials, all with enforcement responsibilities of the type proscribed by &#167; 5 (c) of the Administrative Procedure Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the allegations here made, the single attack of the petitioner pertains to the supervision of the special inquiry officer by the investigative and prosecuting officials of the Immigration Service. The alternative procedure of &#167; 242 (b) was employed in this case, so the presiding officer did not undertake the functions of prosecutor; and there is no allegation that he engaged in investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related case. For the sake of clarity, however, we shall consider all of the differences in the hearing provisions of the two Acts in determining whether the Administrative Procedure Act is to govern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The applicability of the Administrative Procedure Act to deportation proceedings under the Immigration Act of 1917 was considered by this Court in &lt;i&gt;Wong Yang Sung&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McGrath,&lt;/i&gt; 339 U. S. 33 (1950). We there held, contrary to the prevailing interpretation and practice of the Department of Justice, that deportation hearings were subject to the Act. Six months later, Congress provided in the Supplemental Appropriation Act of 1951, 64 Stat. 1048, that proceedings directed toward the exclusion or expulsion of aliens should not be governed by &#167;&#167; 5, 7 and 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act. The issue here presented is whether the Congress reversed itself in the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*307&lt;/span&gt; 1952 Immigration Act and in effect reinstated the &lt;i&gt;Sung&lt;/i&gt; case by making the hearing provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act directly applicable to deportation proceedings. A comparison of the pertinent provisions of the two statutes is perhaps the strongest indication that the Congress had no such intention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Section 242 (b) of the Immigration Act begins by enumerating the functions of the special inquiry officer, that he shall administer oaths, receive evidence, etc. A similar though more extensive and detailed provision appears in &#167; 7 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, but of course this section makes no mention of functions stemming from the special inquiry officer's dual role as prosecutor and judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Section 242 (b) then directs that a determination of deportability be made only upon the record of a proceeding at which the alien had a reasonable opportunity to be present. A similar direction as to the record appears in &#167; 7 (d) of the Administrative Procedure Act, and as to the party's personal appearance in &#167; 6 (a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Section 242 (b) then deals with matters peculiar to deportation proceedings, which have no direct analogues in the Administrative Procedure Act: safeguards to be established to protect mentally incompetent aliens; the right of the inquiry officer to proceed if the alien deliberately absents himself; the option to pursue the alternative procedure, described above, in which one official prosecutes and another decides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Next in &#167; 242 (b) is the limitation already noted on the special inquiry officer's sitting in the same case in which he has also engaged in investigative or prosecuting functions. The more restrictive analogue in &#167; 5 (c) of the Administrative Procedure Act has also been presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Section 242 (b) then sets forth various requirements which are to be included in regulations governing deportation proceedings before the special inquiry officer. The &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*308&lt;/span&gt; first of these gives the alien the right to reasonable notice of the charges against him and of the time and place at which the proceedings shall be held. A similar requirement appears in &#167; 5 (a) of the Administrative Procedure Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. The second provision which &#167; 242 (b) requires to be included in the regulations is the privilege of the alien to be represented by counsel of his own choosing. Section 6 (a) of the Administrative Procedure Act bestows a similar privilege on any person compelled to appear in person before the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. The regulations under &#167; 242 (b) must also provide that the alien be given a reasonable opportunity to present and examine evidence and to cross-examine witnesses. The same ground is covered in &#167; 7 (c) of the Administrative Procedure Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. The regulations promulgated under &#167; 242 (b) must require that decisions of deportability be based upon reasonable, substantial and probative evidence. To the same effect is &#167; 7 (c) of the Administrative Procedure Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. Finally, in addition to the requirements of &#167; 242 (b), there is the direction of &#167; 101 (b) (4) of the Immigration Act that the special inquiry officer shall be subject to such supervision as the Attorney General shall prescribe. This covers the same question as the portion of &#167; 5 (c) of the Administrative Procedure Act dealing with the supervision and control of hearing officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Immigration Act's detailed coverage of the same subject matter dealt with in the hearing provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is clear that Congress was setting up a specialized administrative procedure applicable to deportation hearings, drawing liberally on the analogous provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act and adapting them to the particular needs of the deportation process. The same legislators, Senator McCarran and Congressman Walter, sponsored both the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*309&lt;/span&gt; Administrative Procedure Act and the Immigration Act, and the framework of the latter indicates clearly that the Administrative Procedure Act was being used as a model. But it was intended only as a model, and when in this very particularized adaptation there was a departure from the Administrative Procedure Act&#151;based on novel features in the deportation process&#151;surely it was the intention of the Congress to have the deviation apply and not the general model. Were the courts to ignore these provisions and look only to the Administrative Procedure Act, the painstaking efforts detailed above would be completely meaningless. Congress could have accomplished as much simply by stating that there should be a hearing to determine the question of deportability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 242 (b) expressly states: "The procedure [herein prescribed] shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining the deportability of an alien under this section." That this clear and categorical direction was meant to exclude the application of the Administrative Procedure Act is amply demonstrated by the legislative history of the Immigration Act. The original bills included statements to the effect that the &#167; 242 (b) procedures were to be exclusive, "[n]otwithstanding any other law, including the [Administrative Procedure Act]." S. 3455, 81st Cong., 2d Sess.; S. 716, 82d Cong., 1st Sess.; H. R. 2379, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. The "notwithstanding" clause was dropped in later versions of the Act and did not appear in the bills reported out of committee or in the statute as finally enacted. S. 2055, 82d Cong.; H. R. 5678, 82d Cong.; S. 2550, 82d Cong. The deletion is nowhere explained, but it is possible that the phrase was considered unnecessary&#151;and perhaps inappropriate as a description&#151;as &#167; 242 (b) became more detailed, encompassing in its particularization the greater part of the Administrative Procedure Act's hearing provisions. In the Senate Report accompanying the revised bill, it is &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*310&lt;/span&gt; stated that &#167; 242 (b) sets up special procedures for deportation proceedings, that these are made exclusive, and that the exemption from the Administrative Procedure Act in the Supplemental Appropriation Act of 1951 is repealed because it is "no longer necessary." S. Rep. No. 1137, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 28. The House Report is to the same effect, stating that the prescribed deportation proceedings shall be the sole and exclusive procedure, "notwithstanding the provisions of any other law." H. R. Rep. No. 1365, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 58. Throughout the debates it is made clear that the Administrative Procedure Act does not apply directly, but that its provisions have been specially adapted to meet the needs of the deportation process. See particularly the detailed statement of Senator McCarran, 98 Cong. Rec. 5625-5626, wherein he recognizes a departure from the "dual-examiner provisions" of the Administrative Procedure Act, the very section here in issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exemptions from the terms of the Administrative Procedure Act are not lightly to be presumed in view of the statement in &#167; 12 of the Act that modifications must be express, cf. &lt;i&gt;Shaughnessy&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pedreiro,&lt;/i&gt; 349 U. S. 48. But we cannot ignore the background of the 1952 immigration legislation, its laborious adaptation of the Administrative Procedure Act to the deportation process, the specific points at which deviations from the Administrative Procedure Act were made, the recognition in the legislative history of this adaptive technique and of the particular deviations, and the direction in the statute that the methods therein prescribed shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for deportation proceedings. Unless we are to require the Congress to employ magical passwords in order to effectuate an exemption from the Administrative Procedure Act, we must hold that the present statute expressly supersedes the hearing provisions of that Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*311&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Hearing Procedures and Due Process.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted above, the only complaint which petitioner can urge concerning the hearing procedures in this case is the objection that the special inquiry officer was subject to the supervision and control of officials in the Immigration Service charged with investigative and prosecuting functions. Petitioner would have us hold that the presence of this relationship so strips the hearing of fairness and impartiality as to make the procedure violative of due process. The contention is without substance when considered against the long-standing practice in deportation proceedings, judicially approved in numerous decisions in the federal courts, and against the special considerations applicable to deportation which the Congress may take into account in exercising its particularly broad discretion in immigration matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Claim of Prejudgment.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our opinions in the &lt;i&gt;Accardi&lt;/i&gt; cases stand for the proposition that the Attorney General cannot, under present regulations, dictate the actions of the Board of Immigration Appeals. &lt;i&gt;Accardi&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Shaughnessy,&lt;/i&gt; 347 U. S. 260; &lt;i&gt;Shaughnessy&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Accardi,&lt;/i&gt; 349 U. S. 280. Petitioner alleges that his case was prejudged within the meaning of these decisions because on the day of his arrest for deportation the Attorney General "announced in a public statement&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; both in Washington and in New Orleans that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*312&lt;/span&gt; [petitioner] was an undesirable citizen and had been guilty of many crimes, and that the proceedings were specially designed to deport petitioner," and that "such publicity was bound to have great effect upon the special inquiry officer." He alleged, further, that "the Attorney General some time in 1952 prepared a list of 152 persons whom he desired to deport, and that [his] name was included on this list."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering first the alleged list, it is clear that petitioner has not made out a case of prejudgment. He did not allege that either the inquiry officer or the Board of Immigration Appeals had seen the list, had known of its existence, or had been influenced in their decisions by the inclusion of petitioner's name thereon. In argument before the Board, petitioner stated through counsel that he had "the feeling&#151;and it's a feeling that's based upon &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*313&lt;/span&gt; evidence which we will supply&#151;that the real basis for the denial of suspension here was the fact that Marcello was one of these hundred whom the Attorney General had named . . . ." No evidence of this was forthcoming. As to petitioner's charges concerning the Attorney General's "list," the record is completely barren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor does petitioner fare better in seeking to base prejudgment on the unfavorable publicity accompanying his arrest. He introduced newspaper clippings into evidence to show the adverse local publicity and alleged that this publicity must have had a "great effect" upon the special inquiry officer. But the record indicates clearly that petitioner's case could not possibly have been prejudiced in the hearing before the inquiry officer. On the question of petitioner's deportability, the sole issue decided by him, the hearing officer merely applied the statute to the undisputed facts. Petitioner admitted that he was deportable under the Immigration Act of 1952 if the Act could constitutionally base deportation on his 1938 marihuana conviction. And the hearing officer could be expected in any event to take the law as Congress enacted it. In view of this Court's decisions on the &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; objection, the only ground of attack, he could do nothing else. Petitioner waived the only issue on which prejudgment was possible when he declined to apply for discretionary relief at the proper time. See 8 CFR &#167; 242.54 (d).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board of Immigration Appeals considered the availability of discretionary relief, but as to these officials there was not even an allegation by petitioner that they had known of the unfavorable publicity or had been influenced by it. Indeed, there is every indication that the Board had not prejudged the case, since it considered the question of suspending deportation on the merits although not bound to do so in view of petitioner's waiver below. The Board denied the requested relief, giving reasons. It is not for us in this proceeding to pass on the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*314&lt;/span&gt; factors relied on by the Board in reaching its conclusion. It is sufficient to observe that all had basis in the record and that none stemmed from any sort of dictation by the Attorney General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we note that, even as to his claim relating to adverse publicity, petitioner introduced no evidence other than the newspaper clippings. Surely on this meager showing the district judge was warranted in finding&#151;as he did&#151;that the special inquiry officer, the only official mentioned in petitioner's pleadings, was not controlled in his decision by superiors in the Department of Justice. The decision of the district judge cannot be set aside as clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we hold that under our &lt;i&gt;Accardi&lt;/i&gt; decisions petitioner has failed to make out a case for a new hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner's last objection stems from the fact that his conviction under the Marihuana Tax Act was not ground for deportation at the time he committed the offense, and that he was not forewarned of all the consequences of his criminal conduct. It is urged that we depart from our recent decisions holding that the prohibition of the &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; clause does not apply to deportation, and strike down as unconstitutional the retroactive application of the new grounds for deportation in &#167; 241 (a) (11) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. We perceive no special reasons, however, for overturning our precedents on this matter, and adhere to our decisions in &lt;i&gt;Galvan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Press,&lt;/i&gt; 347 U. S. 522, and &lt;i&gt;Harisiades&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Shaughnessy,&lt;/i&gt; 342 U. S. 580.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*315&lt;/span&gt; MR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER joins, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner was lawfully brought to this country forty-four years ago when he was eight months old and has resided here ever since. He is married and has four children. His wife and children are American citizens. It is settled that he cannot be deported without being accorded a fair hearing in accordance with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fair hearing necessarily includes an impartial tribunal. Petitioner claims that the circumstances here deprived him of that kind of tribunal. The officer who conducted the hearings, decided the case and made recommendations for deportation was connected with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. This hearing officer was subject to the supervision, direction and control of the Attorney General and his subordinate supervisory officers of the Immigration Service who perform investigative and prosecutorial functions. Thus the hearing officer adjudicated the very case against petitioner which the hearing officer's superiors initiated and prosecuted. Petitioner's argument is that requiring him to have his cause adjudicated by such a subordinate of the prosecutors deprives him of due process. This due process challenge cannot be lightly dismissed, but I find it unnecessary to rest my dissent on a determination of that question. For Congress in the Administrative Procedure Act&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; has barred hearing officers from adjudicating cases under the circumstances here, and I think that Act is applicable to this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 5 (c) of the Administrative Procedure Act forbids hearing officers covered by the Act to conduct hearings if they are "responsible to or subject to the supervision &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*316&lt;/span&gt; or direction of any officer, employee or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions for any agency." In 1950 we held in &lt;i&gt;Wong Yang Sung&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McGrath,&lt;/i&gt; 339 U. S. 33, that deportation proceedings must be conducted as required by &#167; 5. Congress, however, later in 1950, put a rider on an appropriation bill providing that "Proceedings under law relating to the exclusion or expulsion of aliens shall hereafter be without regard to the provisions of sections 5, 7, and 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act."&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Were this express modification of the Procedure Act still in effect, we would have to reach the constitutional question raised by petitioner. But this appropriation rider was repealed in the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; The result of this repeal was to leave &#167; 5 (c) of the Administrative Procedure Act applicable to immigration cases unless, as the Government contends, other provisions of the 1952 Immigration Act made the Procedure Act inapplicable. I think this contention of the Government should not be sustained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 12 of the Procedure Act provides that "No subsequent legislation shall be held to supersede or modify the provisions of this Act except to the extent that such legislation shall do so expressly." The 1950 appropriation rider was an express modification of the prior Procedure Act, but unlike the Court I find no such express modification in the 1952 Immigration Act. Indeed that Act's legislative sponsors disclaimed any purpose to bring about even an implied modification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Procedure Act and the 1952 Immigration Act were sponsored by Senator McCarran and Representative Walter. Their original proposals which finally evolved into the 1952 Act did expressly provide that the Procedure Act should not control proceedings under the Immigration &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*317&lt;/span&gt; Act. The provision was that "&lt;i&gt;Notwithstanding any other law, including the Act of June 11, 1946&lt;/i&gt; [the Administrative Procedure Act], the proceedings so prescribed shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining the deportability of an alien who is in the United States."&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; Hearings on these proposals brought strong protests from some organizations, including the American Bar Association, against the provision making the Administrative Procedure Act inapplicable to deportation proceedings.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; Afterwards the sponsors of the immigration measures introduced new bills which significantly omitted from that provision the words "Notwithstanding any other law, including the Act of June 11, 1946 [the Administrative Procedure Act]." Consequently when the bill finally passed there was no language which "expressly" superseded or modified the binding requirement of &#167; 5 (c) of the Administrative Procedure Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senators who voted for the new version which became the 1952 Immigration Act were assured by the senatorial sponsor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Administrative Procedure Act is made applicable to the bill. The Administrative Procedure Act prevails now. . . . The bill provides for administrative procedures and makes the Administrative Procedure Act applicable insofar as the administration of the bill is concerned."&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And House members voting for the 1952 Immigration Act were assured by its House sponsor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Instead of destroying the Administrative Procedures Act, we undo what the Congress did in a deficiency &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*318&lt;/span&gt; appropriation bill several years ago when it legislated to overturn a decision of the Supreme Court, which ruled that the Administrative Procedures Act is applicable in deportation proceedings. We undo that. So here, instead of our destroying the Administrative Procedures Act, we actually see that it is reinstated in every instance."&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reassuring the House again the next day, Representative Walter said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We have been very zealous to see that the philosophy underlying that act [Administrative Procedure] is embodied in this measure. I am sure that if the gentleman will look at page 163, paragraph 46, he will find that the law as it was before the House adopted this amendment to an appropriation bill, has been reinstated and that the decision of the Supreme Court in the Sung case will be the law of the land when this code is adopted."&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As previously pointed out the &lt;i&gt;Sung&lt;/i&gt; case held that &#167; 5 (c) of the Administrative Procedure Act did apply to deportation cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other statements in the discussions of the 1952 Act may look in a different direction from the statements just quoted. But whatever was said, no language in the 1952 Immigration Act expressly authorizes deportation cases to be heard, contrary to the Administrative Procedure Act, by hearing officers who are the dependent subordinates of the immigration agency's prosecutorial staff. The idea of letting a prosecutor judge the very case he prosecutes or supervise and control the job of the judge before whom his case is presented is wholly inconsistent with our concepts of justice. It was this principle on which Congress presumably acted in passing the Procedure Act. Only &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*319&lt;/span&gt; the other day we had pointed out to us an instance in which the immigration authorities had relieved an immigration hearing officer from his duties because they believed that the hearing officer had failed adequately to present available derogatory information against an alien.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; It is hard to defend the fairness of a practice that subjects judges to the power and control of prosecutors. Human nature has not put an impassable barrier between subjection and subserviency, particularly when job security is at stake. That Congress was aware of this is shown by the Procedure Act, and we should not construe the Immigration Act on a contrary assumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would reverse this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Constitution places a ban on all &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; laws. There are no qualifications or exceptions. Article I, &#167; 9, applicable to the Federal Government, speaks in absolute terms: "No . . . ex post facto Law shall be passed."&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The prohibition is the same whether a citizen or an alien is the victim. So far as &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; laws are concerned, the prohibition is all-inclusive and complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a school of thought that the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause includes all retroactive legislation, civil as well as criminal. See Crosskey, Politics and the Constitution, Vol. I, c. XI; Vol. II, p. 1053. Mr. Justice Johnson took that view, maintaining that a restriction of the Clause to criminal acts was unwarranted. See &lt;i&gt;Ogden&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Saunders,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/rqE/ogden-v-saunders/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wheat.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;213&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 271, 286; &lt;i&gt;Satterlee&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Matthewson,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/rsx/satterlee-v-matthewson/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Pet.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;380&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 416, 681 (Appendix). The Court, however, has stated over and again since &lt;i&gt;Calder&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bull,&lt;/i&gt; 3 Dall. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*320&lt;/span&gt; 386, that the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause applies only in criminal cases. See &lt;i&gt;Carpenter&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commonwealth,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;How.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;456&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 463; &lt;i&gt;Johannessen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 225 U. S. 227, 242; &lt;i&gt;Bugajewitz&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Adams,&lt;/i&gt; 228 U. S. 585, 591; &lt;i&gt;Mahler&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Eby,&lt;/i&gt; 264 U. S. 32, 39.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there was a parallel development in the field of &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; legislation. Chief Justice Marshall in &lt;i&gt;Fletcher&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Peck,&lt;/i&gt; 6 Cranch 87, 138-139, refused to construe the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause narrowly and restrict it to criminal prosecutions. The &lt;i&gt;Fletcher&lt;/i&gt; case held that property rights that had vested could not be displaced by legislative fiat. That liberal view persisted. It was given dramatic application in post-Civil War days. The leading cases are &lt;i&gt;Cummings&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Missouri,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/s6q/cummings-v-missouri/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;277&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Ex parte Garland,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/s6r/ex-parte-garland/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;333&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, where the right to practice a person's profession was sought to be taken away, in the first case by a State, in the second by the Federal Government, for acts which carried no such penalty when they were committed. The essence of those proceedings was the revocation of a license. Yet the Court held them to be violative of the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clauses because they were "punishment" for acts carrying no such sanctions when done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deportation may be as severe a punishment as loss of livelihood. See &lt;i&gt;Bridges&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wixon,&lt;/i&gt; 326 U. S. 135, 154; &lt;i&gt;Delgadillo&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Carmichael,&lt;/i&gt; 332 U. S. 388, 391. As Mr. Justice Brandeis stated in &lt;i&gt;Ng Fung Ho&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;White,&lt;/i&gt; 259 U. S. 276, 284, deportation may result "in loss of both property and life; or of all that makes life worth living."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find nothing in the Constitution exempting aliens from the operation of &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; laws. I would think, therefore, that, if Congress today passed a law making any alien who had ever violated any traffic law in this country deportable, the law would be &lt;i&gt;ex post facto.&lt;/i&gt; Congress, of course, has broad powers over the deportation &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*321&lt;/span&gt; of aliens. See &lt;i&gt;Harisiades&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Shaughnessy,&lt;/i&gt; 342 U. S. 580. But the bare fact of a traffic violation would not reasonably be regarded as demonstrating that such a person was presently an undesirable resident. It would relate solely to an historic incident that carried no such punishment when committed. The present Act has the same vice. The alien is not deported after a hearing and on a finding by the authorities that he is undesirable for continued residence here. It is the bare past violation of the narcotic laws that is sufficient and conclusive, however isolated or insignificant such violation may have been. 8 U. S. C. &#167; 1251. The case is, therefore, different from the earlier deportation cases where the past acts were mere counters in weighing present fitness.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a rational connection between the imposition of the penalty of deportation and the &lt;i&gt;present&lt;/i&gt; desirability of the alien as a resident in this country, the conclusion is inescapable that the Act merely adds a new punishment for a past offense. That is the very injustice that the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause was designed to prevent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[5]  Petitioner introduced clippings appearing in New Orleans newspapers relating to the statement. While the press release of the Attorney General was not put in evidence, it read as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Attorney General James P. McGranery announced today that Carlos Marcello of Miami, Florida, and Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, has been arrested on a deportation warrant by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The arrest in New Orleans was the first major deportation move undertaken since the new Immigration and Nationality Act became effective December 24, 1952. The action was another step in the Attorney General's program of denaturalization and/or deportation of undesirable persons of foreign birth who are engaged in racketeering or other criminal activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Marcello, born February 6, 1910, in Tunis, Africa, entered the United States for permanent residence October 7, 1910, at New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He allegedly is engaged in large-scale slot machine operations and other gambling activities in Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The deportation warrant was based on his conviction in 1938 for violation of the Marijuana Act. Such a conviction is a deportable offense under the new Immigration and Nationality Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The action follows lengthy investigations by both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. His conviction under the Marijuana Act was one of only two in his checkered career. The other case in which he was convicted was under Louisiana State law, the conviction being for assault and robbery, and on May 13, 1930, he was sentenced to serve a term of 9 to 14 years in the Louisiana State Penitentiary. The Governor of Louisiana gave him a full pardon for this crime July 16, 1935.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Marcello served a year and a day after his conviction under the Marijuana Act."&lt;/p&gt;

S. 32, the Act in question provided that aliens in certain classes (including those convicted under specified statutes) should be deported if the Secretary of Labor found those aliens to be undesirable residents of the United States. Thus the primary basis for deportation was a finding by the appropriate administrative official that an alien was presently an undesirable resident. In &lt;i&gt;Bugajewitz&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Adams,&lt;/i&gt; 228 U. S. 585, the Court stated with regard to the alien to be deported, ". . . we must take it, at least, that she is a prostitute now," and concluded that, with regard to her, it was "not necessary to construe the statute as having any retrospective effect." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 590, 591.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Johannessen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 225 U. S. 227, involved an attempt to cancel a certificate of citizenship on the ground it had been fraudulently and illegally procured. The Court pointed out that the Act did not impose a new penalty on the wrongdoer but merely provided a method for depriving him of a privilege "that was never rightfully his." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 242-243.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="parties"&gt;Charles LAWLOR and Mitchell Pantzer, Co-Partners Trading  as Independent Poster Exchange, Petitioners,&lt;br&gt;v.&lt;br&gt;NATIONAL SCREEN SERVICE CORPORATION et al.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="docket"&gt;No. 163.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="date"&gt;Argued Feb. 9, 10, 1955.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="date"&gt;Decided June 6, 1955.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="prelims"&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Francis T. Anderson, Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Louis Nizer, New York City, for respondent National Screen Service Corp.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Earl G. Harrison, Philadelphia, Pa., for respondents Columbia Pictures Corp. et al.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Chief Justice WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p1"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This is an action to recover treble damages for alleged violation of the federal antitrust laws. The only question presented is whether the action is barred, in the circumstances of the case, under the doctrine of res judicata.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p2"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Petitioners are engaged in the business of leasing advertising posters to motion picture exhibitors in the Philadelphia area. Such posters, known in the trade as standard accessories, embody copy-righted matter from the motion pictures being advertised. Until recent years, standard accessories could be purchased directly from the motion picture companies themselves. Beginning with Paramount in 1939, however, the eight major producers granted to National Screen Service Corporation the exclusive right to manufacture and distribute various advertising materials, including standard accessories as well as specialty accessories and film trailers, for their motion pictures. RKO followed in 1940, Loew's in 1942, Universal in 1944, Columbia in 1945, United Artists and Warner Brothers in 1946, and 20th Century Fox in 1947.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p3"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In 1942, together with a number of others in similar businesses, petitioners commenced a treble-damage anti-trust action against National Screen and the three producers who had already granted exclusive licenses to National Screen. The complaint alleged that the defendants had conspired to establish a monopoly in the distribution of standard accessories by means of the exclusive licenses and that the plaintiffs' businesses had been injured as a consequence. The complaint also alleged that National Screen was then negotiating with the other major producers to procure similar licenses. In addition to damages, an injunction was sought against the defendants' 'illegal acts and practices.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p4"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In 1943, prior to any trial, the suit was settled. The basis of the settlement was an agreement by National Screen to furnish the plaintiffs with all standard accessories distributed by National Screen pursuant to its exclusive license agreements with producers, including exclusive license agreements which might be executed in the future. In exchange, the plaintiffs agreed that they would withdraw the suit and that they would pay National Screen for the materials at specified prices. Pursuant to the settlement, the suit was dismissed 'with prejudice' by court order. No findings of fact or law were made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p5"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The sublicense was to run three years. In 1946 it was renewed for another five-year term. In 1949, while the sublicense was still in force, petitioners brought the instant action, again seeking treble damages and injunctive relief. Named as defendants respondents here&amp;#8212;were National Screen, the three producers who were parties to the 1942 suit, and the five producers who licensed National Screen subsequent to the dismissal of the 1942 suit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p6"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In their present complaint, petitioners allege that the settlement of the 1942 suit was merely a device used by the defendants in that case to perpetuate their conspiracy and monopoly. They also allege: that five other producers have joined the conspiracy since 1943; that National Screen has deliberately made slow and erratic deliveries of advertising materials under the sublicense in an effort to destroy petitioners' business; and that for the same purpose National Screen has used tie-in sales and other means of exploiting its monopoly power.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; Petitioners seek damages for resulting injuries suffered from August 16, 1943 in other words, for a period beginning several months after the dismissal of the 1942 complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p7"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In 1951, on petitioners' motion for summary judgment, the District Court held that petitioners were entitled to injunctive relief against National Screen because the undisputed facts supported petitioners' claim of unlawful monopoly.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; As to the producers, however, the District Court held that conflicting evidence on the issue of conspiracy made a trial necessary.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; But in 1953, before any trial was held and before a decree against National Screen could be framed, the defendants moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the 1943 judgment was res judicata. The District Court, another judge then sitting, granted the motion and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; We granted certiorari because of the importance of the question thus presented in the enforcement of the federal antitrust laws.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="fn5_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p8"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The basic distinction between the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel, as those terms are used in this case, has frequently been emphasized.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6" id="fn6_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; Thus, under the doctrine of res judicata, a judgment 'on the merits' in a prior suit involving the same parties or their privies bars a second suit based on the same cause of action. Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, on the other hand, such a judgment precludes relitigation of issues actually litigated and determined in the prior suit, regardless of whether it was based on the same cause of action as the second suit. Recognizing this distinction, the court below concluded that 'No question of collateral estoppel by the former judgment is involved because the case was never tried and there was not, therefore, such finding of fact which will preclude the parties to that litigation from questioning the finding thereafter.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn7" id="fn7_ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; Turning then to the doctrine of res judicata, the court correctly stated the question before it as 'whether the plaintiffs in the present suit are suing upon the 'same cause of action' as that upon which they sued in 1942 and lost.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn8" id="fn8_ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; The court answered the question in the affirmative on the ground that the two suits were based on 'essentially the same course of wrongful conduct.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn9" id="fn9_ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt; The court acknowledged that 'there are some additional allegations, some new acts which the plaintiffs say the defendants have done since the earlier suit' and that 'Additional defendants were joined in the 1949 suit', but concluded that 'in substance the complaint is the same * * *.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn10" id="fn10_ref"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p9"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It is of course true that the 1943 judgment dismissing the previous suit 'with prejudice' bars a later suit on the same cause of action.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn11" id="fn11_ref"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt; It is likewise true that the judgment was unaccompanied by findings and hence did not bind the parties on any issue&amp;#8212;such as the legality of the exclusive license agreements or their effect on petitioners' business&amp;#8212;which might arise in connection with another cause of action.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn12" id="fn12_ref"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt; To this extent we are in accord with the decision below. We believe, however, that the court erred in concluding that the 1942 and 1949 suits were based on the same cause of action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p10"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;That both suits involved 'essentially the same course of wrongful conduct' is not decisive. Such a course of conduct&amp;#8212;for example, an abatable nuisance&amp;#8212;may frequently give rise to more than a single cause of action.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn13" id="fn13_ref"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; And so it is here. The conduct presently complained of was all subsequent to the 1943 judgment.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn14" id="fn14_ref"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt; In addition, there are new antitrust violations alleged here&amp;#8212;deliberately slow deliveries and tie-in sales, among others&amp;#8212;not present in the former action. While the 1943 judgment precludes recovery on claims arising prior to its entry, it cannot be given the effect of extinguishing claims which did not even then exist and which could not possibly have been sued upon in the previous case. In the interim, moreover, there was a substantial change in the scope of the defendants' alleged monopoly; five other producers had granted exclusive licenses to National Screen, with the result that the defendants' control over the market for standard accessories had increased to nearly 100%.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn15" id="fn15_ref"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt; Under these circumstances, whether the defendants' conduct be regarded as a series of individual torts or as one continuing tort, the 1943 judgment does not constitute a bar to the instant suit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p11"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This conclusion is unaffected by the circumstance that the 1942 complaint sought, in addition to treble damages, injunctive relief which, if granted, would have prevented the illegal acts now complained of. A combination of facts constituting two or more causes of action on the law side of a court does not congeal into a single cause of action merely because equitable relief is also sought. And, as already noted, a prior judgment is res judicata only as to suits involving the same cause of action.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn16" id="fn16_ref"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt; There is no merit, therefore, in the respondents' contention that petitioners are precluded by their failure in the 1942 suit to press their demand for injunctive relief. Particularly is this so in view of the public interest in vigilant enforcement of the antitrust laws through the instrumentality of the private treble-damage action. Acceptance of the respondents' novel contention would in effect confer on them a partial immunity from civil liability for future violations. Such a result is consistent with neither the antitrust laws nor the doctrine of res judicata.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p12"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;With respect to the five defendants who were not parties to the 1942 suit, there is yet a second ground for our decision. The court below held that their relationship to the other defendants was "close enough to bring them all within the scope of the doctrine of res judicata."&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn17" id="fn17_ref"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt; With this conclusion, we cannot agree. We need not stop to consider the outer bounds of the rule of privity and allied concepts.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn18" id="fn18_ref"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt; It is sufficient here to point out that the five defendants do not fall within the orthodox categories of privies;&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn19" id="fn19_ref"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt; that they could not have been joined in the 1942 case since they did not even enter the alleged conspiracy until after the judgment on which they now rely;&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn20" id="fn20_ref"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; that in any event there was no obligation to join them in the 1942 case since as joint tort-feasors they were not indispensable parties;&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn21" id="fn21_ref"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt; and that their liability was not 'altogether dependent upon the culpability' of the defendants in the 1942 suit.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn22" id="fn22_ref"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p13"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p14"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Reversed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;'We conclude that the decisions entered by the Tax Court for the years 1933, 1938, and 1939 were only a pro forma acceptance by the Tax Court of an agreement between the parties to settle their controversy for reasons undisclosed. There is no showing either in the record or by extrinsic evidence, see Russell v. Place, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/sBr/russell-v-place/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;94&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;606&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 608, 24 L.Ed. 214, that the issues raised by the pleadings were submitted to the Tax Court for determination or determined by that court. They may or may not have been agreed upon by the parties. Perhaps, as the Court of Appeals inferred, the parties did agree on the basis for depreciation. Perhaps, the settlement was made for a different reason, for some exigency arising out of the bankruptcy proceeding. As the case reaches us, we are unable to tell whether the agreement of the parties was based on the merits or on some collateral consideration.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*333&lt;/span&gt; MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This action was instituted by petitioner in the District Court for the District of Columbia. The principal relief sought is a declaration that petitioner's removal and debarment from federal employment were invalid. Prior to trial, the District Court granted the respondents' motion for judgment on the pleadings. The judgment was affirmed, one judge dissenting, by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, relying on its decision in &lt;i&gt;Bailey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Richardson,&lt;/i&gt; 86 U. S. App. D. C. 248, 182 F. 2d 46, sustained here by an equally divided vote, 341 U. S. 918. We granted certiorari, 348 U. S. 882, because the case appeared to present the same constitutional question left unresolved by this Court's action in &lt;i&gt;Bailey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Richardson, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic facts are undisputed. Petitioner is a professor of medicine, specializing in the study of metabolism, at Yale University. For several years prior to 1953, because of his eminence in the field of medical science, he was employed as a Special Consultant in the United States Public Health Service of the Federal Security Agency. On April 10, 1953, the functions of the Federal Security Agency were transferred to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, headed by respondent Hobby. Petitioner's duties required his presence in Washington from four to ten days each year, when called upon by the Surgeon General, to render advice concerning proposals to grant federal assistance to various medical research institutions. This work was not of a confidential or sensitive character and did not entail access to classified material. Petitioner was compensated at a specified per diem rate for days actually worked. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*334&lt;/span&gt; At the time of his removal, petitioner was employed under an appointment expiring on December 31, 1953.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 21, 1947, Executive Order 9835 was issued by the President.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; It provided that the head of each department and agency in the Executive Branch of the Government "shall be personally responsible for an effective program to assure that disloyal civilian officers or employees are not retained in employment in his department or agency." Toward that end, the Order directed the establishment within each department or agency of one or more loyalty boards "for the purpose of hearing loyalty cases arising within such department or agency and making recommendations with respect to the removal of any officer or employee . . . on grounds relating to loyalty . . . ." The order also provided for the establishment of a central Loyalty Review Board in the Civil Service Commission. The Board, in addition to various supervisory functions, was authorized "to review cases involving persons recommended for dismissal . . . by the loyalty board of any department or agency . . . ." The standard for removal prescribed by the Order was whether, "on all the evidence, reasonable grounds exist for belief that the person involved is disloyal to the Government of the United States." This standard was amended on April 28, 1951.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; As amended, the standard to be applied was whether, "on all the evidence, there is a reasonable doubt as to the loyalty of the person involved to the Government of the United States."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 1949, Joseph E. McElvain, Chairman of the Board of Inquiry on Employee Loyalty of the Federal Security Agency, notified petitioner that derogatory information relating to his loyalty had been received. Accompanying McElvain's letter was a detailed interrogatory &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*335&lt;/span&gt; relating to petitioner's associations and affiliations. Petitioner promptly completed the form and returned it. Shortly thereafter, McElvain advised petitioner that the Agency Board had determined that no reasonable grounds existed for belief that petitioner was disloyal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 1951, following the amendment of the removal standard prescribed by Executive Order 9835, the Executive Secretary of the Loyalty Review Board advised McElvain that petitioner's case should be reopened and readjudicated pursuant to the amended standard. Three months later, the Acting Chairman of the Loyalty Review Board informed McElvain that a panel of the Loyalty Review Board had considered petitioner's case and had recommended that it be remanded to the Agency Board for a hearing. Acting on the Loyalty Review Board's recommendation, McElvain sent petitioner a letter of charges. Sixteen charges were specified, relating to alleged membership in the Communist Party, sponsorship of certain petitions, affiliation with various organizations, and alleged association with Communists and Communist sympathizers. In his reply, made under oath, petitioner denied that he had ever been a member of the Communist Party and set forth information concerning the other charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 1 and 2, 1952, the Agency Board conducted a hearing on petitioner's case in New Haven, Connecticut. The sources of the information as to the facts bearing on the charges were not identified or made available to petitioner's counsel for cross-examination. The identity of one or more of the informants furnishing such information, but not of all the informants, was known to the Board. The only evidence adduced at the hearing was presented by petitioner. He testified under oath that he had never been a member of the Communist Party and also testified concerning the other charges against him. He did not &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*336&lt;/span&gt; refuse to answer any question directed to him. Petitioner's testimony was supported by the testimony of eighteen other witnesses and the affidavits and statements of some forty additional persons. On May 23, 1952, McElvain notified petitioner that the Agency Board had determined that, on all the evidence, there was no reasonable doubt as to petitioner's loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thereafter, on April 6, 1953, petitioner was advised by the Loyalty Review Board that it had determined to conduct a "post-audit" of the Agency Board's determination and, to this end, "hold a hearing and reach its own decision."&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; The hearing was held on May 12, 1953, in New Haven, before a panel of the Board consisting of respondents Hessey, Amen, and King. Once again, as at the previous hearing, the only evidence adduced was presented by petitioner. In his own testimony, petitioner denied membership in the Communist Party, discussed his political beliefs and his motives for engaging in the activities and associations which were the subject of the charges, and answered all questions put to him by the Board. In support of petitioner's testimony, five witnesses stated their long acquaintance with petitioner and their firm conviction of petitioner's loyalty.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; In addition to this evidence, the record before the Board contained information supplied by informants whose identity was not disclosed to petitioner. The identity of one or more, but not all, of these informants was known to the Board. The information given by such informants had not been given under oath. The record also contained the evidence adduced by petitioner at the previous hearing. On this record, the Board determined that "on all the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*337&lt;/span&gt; evidence, there is a reasonable doubt as to Dr. Peters' loyalty to the Government of the United States."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By letter of May 22, 1953, the Chairman of the Board advised petitioner of the Board's finding. The letter further stated that respondent Hobby had been notified of the decision and that petitioner had "been barred from the Federal service for a period of three years from May 18, 1953, and any and all pending applications or existing eligibilities are cancelled." The order of debarment was made by the Board on behalf of the Civil Service Commission, composed of respondents Young, Moore, and Lawton.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; Following his removal and after an unsuccessful attempt to obtain a rehearing, petitioner brought the instant suit, naming each of the respondents as a defendant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his complaint, petitioner contends that the action taken against him was "in violation of Executive Order 9835 and the Constitution of the United States . . . ." In support of his contention that the action violated the Executive Order, he makes the allegation, among others, that the Loyalty Review Board "exercised power beyond its power `to make advisory recommendations . . . to the head of the . . . agency', as defined by Executive Order 9835, Part III, &#167; 1a . . . ." On the constitutional level, petitioner complains chiefly of the denial of any opportunity to confront and cross-examine his secret accusers. He alleges that his removal and debarment deprived him "of liberty and property without due process of law in that they branded him as a person disloyal to his country, arbitrarily, without basis in fact, and without a fair procedure and hearing." In addition, he alleges that "The imposition of the penalty of ineligibility for government service &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*338&lt;/span&gt; constituted a violation of the prohibition against bills of attainder and &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; laws by punishing the plaintiff by declaring him ineligible to serve the Government without a judicial trial or a fair administrative hearing . . . ." Finally, petitioner alleges that his removal and debarment, solely on the basis of his political opinions, violated his right to freedom of speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this Court, petitioner urges us to decide the case on the constitutional issues. These issues, if reached by the Court, would obviously present serious and far-reaching problems in reconciling fundamental constitutional guarantees with the procedures used to determine the loyalty of government personnel. Compare &lt;i&gt;Wieman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Updegraff,&lt;/i&gt; 344 U. S. 183; &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lovett,&lt;/i&gt; 328 U. S. 303; &lt;i&gt;Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McGrath,&lt;/i&gt; 341 U. S. 123. And note this Court's division in &lt;i&gt;Bailey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Richardson, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; We find, however, that the case can be decided without reaching the constitutional issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a very early date, this Court has declined to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it. &lt;i&gt;Charles River Bridge&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Warren Bridge,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Pet.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;420&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 553. See &lt;i&gt;Alma Motor Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Timken-Detroit Axle Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 329 U. S. 129, 136. Applying this rule to the instant case, we must at the outset determine whether petitioner's removal and debarment were effected in accord with Executive Order 9835. On consideration of this question, we conclude that the Loyalty Review Board's action was so patently in violation of the Executive Order&#151;in fact, beyond the Board's delegated jurisdiction under the Order&#151;that the constitutionality of the Order itself does not come into issue.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*339&lt;/span&gt; III.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of the Loyalty Review Board to adjudicate individual cases is set forth specifically in &#167; 1a of Part III of the Order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Board shall have authority to review cases involving persons recommended for dismissal on grounds relating to loyalty by the loyalty board of any department or agency and to make advisory recommendations thereon to the head of the employing department or agency. Such cases may be referred to the Board either by the employing department or agency, or by the officer or employee concerned."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, &#167; 3 of Part II, which prescribes the procedures to be followed in loyalty cases under the Order, provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A recommendation of removal by a loyalty board shall be subject to appeal by the officer or employee affected, prior to his removal, to the head of the employing department or agency . . . and the decision of the department or agency concerned shall be subject to appeal to the Civil Service Commission's Loyalty Review Board, hereinafter provided for, for an advisory recommendation."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authority thus conferred on the Loyalty Review Board was limited to "cases involving persons recommended for dismissal on grounds relating to loyalty by the loyalty board of any department or agency . . . ." And, even as to these cases, the Loyalty Review Board was denied any power to undertake review on its own motion; only the employee recommended for dismissal, or his department or agency, could refer such a case to the Loyalty Review Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*340&lt;/span&gt; In petitioner's case, the Board failed to respect either of these limitations. Petitioner had been twice cleared by the Agency Board and hence did not fall in the category of "persons recommended for dismissal on grounds relating to loyalty by the loyalty board of any department or agency." Moreover, petitioner's case was never referred to the Loyalty Review Board by petitioner or the Agency. Instead, the Loyalty Review Board, acting solely on its own motion, undertook to "hold a hearing and reach its own decision." On both grounds, the Board's action was plainly beyond its jurisdiction unless such action was authorized by some other provision in the Order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 1 of Part III also provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"b. The Board shall make rules and regulations, not inconsistent with the provisions of this order, deemed necessary to implement statutes and Executive orders relating to employee loyalty.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"c. The Loyalty Review Board shall also:&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(1) Advise all departments and agencies on all problems relating to employee loyalty.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(2) Disseminate information pertinent to employee loyalty programs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(3) Coordinate the employee loyalty policies and procedures of the several departments and agencies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(4) Make reports and submit recommendations to the Civil Service Commission for transmission to the President from time to time as may be necessary to the maintenance of the employee loyalty program."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting under subsection (b), the Board promulgated detailed regulations, effective December 14, 1947, elaborating its powers under the Order.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; The regulations &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*341&lt;/span&gt; distinguished between two types of proceedings in individual cases. The first dealt with appeals from adverse decisions.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; The second, described in Regulation 14, claimed for the Board a very different function.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; As amended on January 22, 1952, Regulation 14 provided:&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"&lt;i&gt;Post-audit and review of files.&lt;/i&gt; (a) The Board, or an executive committee of the Board, shall, as deemed necessary from time to time, cause post-audits to be made of the files on loyalty cases decided by the employing department or agency, or by a regional loyalty board.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(b) The Board or an executive committee of the Board, or a duly constituted panel of the Board, shall have the right, in its discretion to call up for review any case decided by any department or agency loyalty board or regional loyalty board, or by any head of an employing department or agency, even though no appeal has been taken. Any such review shall be made by a panel of the Board, and the panel, whether or not a hearing has been held in the case, may affirm the procedural method followed and the action taken, or remand the case with appropriate instructions to the agency or regional loyalty board concerned for hearing or for such further action or procedure as the panel may determine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(c) If a panel reviews a record on post-audit and reaches the conclusion that the determination made below does not fully recognize that it is of `vital importance' as set forth in Executive Order 9835 `that persons employed in the Federal service be &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*342&lt;/span&gt; of complete and unswerving loyalty to the United States,' then the panel may call up the case for a hearing, and after such hearing may affirm or reverse the original determination or decision. Nevertheless, it must always be remembered that while it is important that maximum protection be afforded the United States against infiltration of disloyal persons into the ranks of its employees, equal protection must be afforded loyal employees from unfounded accusations of disloyalty."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In undertaking to "hold a hearing and reach its own decision" in petitioner's case, the Board relied on Regulation 14 as the source of its authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This regulation, however, is valid only if it is "not inconsistent with the provisions of this order." The Board's "post-audit" function, when used to survey the operation of the loyalty program and to insure a uniformity of procedures in the various loyalty boards, might well be justified under the Board's powers to "Advise all departments and agencies on all problems relating to employee loyalty" and "Coordinate the employee loyalty policies and procedures of the several departments and agencies." But the regulation did not restrict the "post-audit" function to advice and coordination. Rather, it purported to allow the Board "to call up for review any case . . . even though no appeal has been taken" and to hold a new hearing and "after such hearing [to] affirm or reverse the original determination or decision." The Board thus sought to do by regulation precisely what it was not permitted to do under the Order. Although the Order limited the Board's jurisdiction to appeals from adverse rulings, the regulation asserted authority over appeals from favorable rulings as well; and although the Order limited the Board's jurisdiction to appeals referred &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*343&lt;/span&gt; to the Board by the employee or his department or agency, the regulation asserted authority in the Board to adjudicate individual cases on its own motion. To this extent the regulation must fall. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Addison&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Holly Hill Fruit Products,&lt;/i&gt; 322 U. S. 607, 616-618, and &lt;i&gt;Federal Communications Commission&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Broadcasting Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 347 U. S. 284, 296-297.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our interpretation of the language of the Order is confirmed by &lt;i&gt;The Report of the President's Temporary Commission on Employee Loyalty,&lt;/i&gt; released by the President on March 22, 1947, simultaneously with the Order. Four months before, the Commission had been established "to inquire into the standards, procedures, and organizational provisions for (a) the investigation of persons who are employed by the United States Government or are applicants for such employment, and (b) the removal or disqualification from employment of any disloyal or subversive person."&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; In conducting its investigation, the Commission sought suggestions from 50 selected government agencies. The replies revealed general agreement "that the employing agency be responsible for the removal of its own employees."&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt; But a substantial number of the replies indicated:&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(1) that there should be established an independent over-all centralized authority acting solely for and on behalf of the President in the matter of the removal of disloyal employees; or (2) that the original hearing in loyalty cases should be within the employing agency, subject to a right of appeal to a centralized &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*344&lt;/span&gt; agency established with a power to review &lt;i&gt;de novo;&lt;/i&gt; or (3) that the overall agency be established with advisory powers only."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these three proposals, the first was flatly rejected by the Commission, which instead urged the establishment of a centralized agency combining elements of the second and third. The Commission thought it "imperative that the head of each department or agency be solely responsible for his own loyalty program."&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; On the other hand, "so that the loyalty procedures operative in each of the departments and agencies may be properly coordinated . . . ," the Commission recognized "that a central review board should be created with definite advisory responsibilities in connection with the loyalty program."&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt; These "advisory responsibilities" were envisaged as "similar to those of a clearing house."&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt; But, in addition, the board was to be authorized to review decisions adverse to employees, when referred to the board by the employee or the employing agency.&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt; Nowhere in the report was it even remotely suggested that the board was to have general jurisdiction to adjudicate individual cases; on the contrary, as already noted, the Commission expressly disapproved such a proposal. The Commission's recommendations, with only slight changes in language, were adopted in the provisions of the Order designating the functions of the Loyalty Review Board.&lt;sup&gt;[18]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While loyalty proceedings may not involve the imposition of criminal sanctions, the limitation on the Board's review power to adverse determinations was in keeping with the deeply rooted principle of criminal law that a &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*345&lt;/span&gt; verdict of guilty is appealable while a verdict of acquittal is not.&lt;sup&gt;[19]&lt;/sup&gt; This safeguard was one of the few, and perhaps one of the most important, afforded an accused employee under the Order. Its effect was to leave the initial determination of his loyalty to his co-workers in the department &#151;to his peers, as it were&#151;who knew most about his character and his actions and his duties. He was thus assured that his fate would not be decided by political appointees who perhaps might be more vulnerable to the pressures of heated public opinion. To sanction the abrogation of this safeguard through Regulation 14, in the face of the Order's language and the Commission's report, would be to sanction administrative lawlessness. Agencies, whether created by statute or Executive Order, must of course be free to give reasonable scope to the terms conferring their authority. But they are not free to ignore plain limitations on that authority. Compare &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wickersham,&lt;/i&gt; 201 U. S. 390, 398.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is urged, however, that the President's failure to express his disapproval of Regulation 14 must be deemed to constitute acquiescence in it. From this, it is contended that the President thus impliedly expanded the Loyalty Review Board's powers under the Order. We cannot indulge in such fanciful speculation. Nothing short of explicit Presidential action could justify a conclusion that the limitations on the Board's powers had been eliminated. No such action by the President has been brought to our attention. There is, in fact, no evidence that the President even knew of the Board's &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*346&lt;/span&gt; practice prior to April 27, 1953, three weeks after the Board had notified petitioner of its intention to "hold a hearing and reach its own decision." And knowledge of the practice can hardly be imputed to him in view of the relatively small number of cases&#151;only 20&#151;in which the Board reversed favorable determinations over its 6-year life.&lt;sup&gt;[20]&lt;/sup&gt; On April 27, 1953, the President issued Executive Order 10450, revoking Executive Order 9835 and establishing a new loyalty program.&lt;sup&gt;[21]&lt;/sup&gt; Executive Order 10450 by its own terms did not take effect until 30 days later on May 27, 1953. Although petitioner's case was heard and determined by the Loyalty Review Board during this 30-day period and hence was not subject to Executive Order 10450, the Government contends that &#167; 11 evidences knowledge and approval of Regulation 14.&lt;sup&gt;[22]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*347&lt;/span&gt; Section 11, however, did no more than recognize that cases under Regulation 14 might be pending on the effective date and authorize their determination thereafter. And, even as to these cases, &#167; 11 did not authorize the Board to recommend dismissal; at most the Board could remand the cases to the departments or agencies for reconsideration. With respect to cases determined &lt;i&gt;prior&lt;/i&gt; to the effective date&#151;such as petitioner's&#151;&#167; 11 surely affords no basis for divining a Presidential intention to authorize the Board to disregard its previously defined jurisdictional boundaries. Particularly is this so where, as here, substantial rights affecting the lives and property of citizens are at stake. This Court has recognized that "a badge of infamy" attaches to a public employee found disloyal. &lt;i&gt;Wieman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Updegraff,&lt;/i&gt; 344 U. S. 183, 191. The power asserted by the Board to impose such a badge on petitioner cannot be supported on so tenuous a theory as that pressed upon us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor was the adjudication of petitioner's case, on its own motion and despite a favorable determination by the Agency Board, the only unwarranted assumption of power by the Loyalty Review Board. In cancelling petitioner's eligibility from "the Federal service" for a period of three years, the Board purported to act under Civil Service Rule V, &#167; 5.101 (a), which bars an employee from "&lt;i&gt;the competitive service&lt;/i&gt; within 3 years &lt;i&gt;after a final determination&lt;/i&gt; that he is disqualified for Federal employment because of a reasonable doubt as to his loyalty . . . ."&lt;sup&gt;[23]&lt;/sup&gt; The Board's order of debarment, however, was not limited to "the competitive service" but extended to all federal employment.&lt;sup&gt;[24]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*348&lt;/span&gt; And although such a "final determination" could be made only by the employing agency, the Board did not wait for respondent Hobby to act on its recommendation. Petitioner's debarment was made effective on May 18, 1953, four days before the Chairman of the Board wrote petitioner of the Board's determination and nearly four weeks before the Department took action to remove petitioner from his position. The Board's haste can be understood only in terms of its announced intention to deprive agencies of all discretion to determine whether the Board's recommendations should be accepted.&lt;sup&gt;[25]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IV.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There only remains for consideration the question of relief. Initially petitioner is entitled to a declaratory judgment that his removal and debarment were invalid. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*349&lt;/span&gt; He is further entitled to an order directing the respondent members of the Civil Service Commission to expunge from its records the Loyalty Review Board's finding that there is a reasonable doubt as to petitioner's loyalty and to expunge from its records any ruling that petitioner is barred from federal employment by reason of that finding. His prayer for reinstatement, however, cannot be granted, since it appears that the term of petitioner's appointment would have expired on December 31, 1953, wholly apart from his removal on loyalty grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment below is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for entry of a decree in conformity with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BLACK, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would prefer to decide this case on the constitutional questions discussed by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS or on some of the other constitutional questions necessarily involved. See &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lovett,&lt;/i&gt; 328 U. S. 303. See my dissents in &lt;i&gt;Dennis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 341 U. S. 494, 579-581; &lt;i&gt;Communications Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Douds,&lt;/i&gt; 339 U. S. 382, 445-453. See also my concurring opinion in &lt;i&gt;Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McGrath,&lt;/i&gt; 341 U. S. 123, 142-149. I agree that it is generally better for this Court not to decide constitutional questions in cases which can be adequately disposed of on non-constitutional grounds. See &lt;i&gt;Charles River Bridge&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Warren Bridge,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Pet.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;420&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 553. But this generally accepted practice should not be treated as though it were an inflexible rule to be inexorably followed under all circumstances. See &lt;i&gt;Youngstown Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sawyer,&lt;/i&gt; 343 U. S. 579, 584-585. Here, as in the &lt;i&gt;Youngstown&lt;/i&gt; case, I think it would be better judicial practice to reach and decide the constitutional issues, although I agree with the Court that the Presidential Order can justifiably be construed &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*350&lt;/span&gt; as denying the Loyalty Review Board the power exercised in this case. For this reason I join the opinion of the Court. But I wish it distinctly understood that I have grave doubt as to whether the Presidential Order has been authorized by any Act of Congress. That order and others associated with it embody a broad, far-reaching espionage program over government employees. These orders look more like legislation to me than properly authorized regulations to carry out a clear and explicit command of Congress. I also doubt that the Congress could delegate power to do what the President has attempted to do in the Executive Order under consideration here. And of course the Constitution does not confer lawmaking power on the President. &lt;i&gt;Youngstown Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sawyer,&lt;/i&gt; 343 U. S. 579.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have thought it necessary to add these statements to the Court's opinion in order that the President's power to issue the order might not be considered as having been decided &lt;i&gt;sub silentio.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all deference, I do not think we can avoid the constitutional issue in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most that can be said is that the terms of the Executive Order are ambiguous. The construction urged by the Attorney General is buttressed by a history of administrative practice, with case after case being reviewed by the Board in the precise manner of this one. The question of construction of the Executive Order was so well settled that neither the Government nor Dr. Peters suggested the absence of authority in the Review Board to take jurisdiction of this case on its own motion. I agree that it had such authority. It, therefore, becomes necessary for me to reach the constitutional issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peters was condemned by faceless informers, some of whom were not known even to the Board that condemned &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*351&lt;/span&gt; him. Some of these informers were not even under oath. None of them had to submit to cross-examination. None had to face Dr. Peters. So far as we or the Board know, they may be psychopaths or venal people, like Titus Oates, who revel in being informers. They may bear old grudges. Under cross-examination their stories might disappear like bubbles. Their whispered confidences might turn out to be yarns conceived by twisted minds or by people who, though sincere, have poor faculties of observation and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confrontation and cross-examination under oath are essential, if the American ideal of due process is to remain a vital force in our public life. We deal here with the reputation of men and their right to work&#151;things more precious than property itself. We have here a system where government with all its power and authority condemns a man to a suspect class and the outer darkness, without the rudiments of a fair trial. The practice of using faceless informers has apparently spread through a vast domain. It is used not only to get rid of employees in the Government, but also employees who work for private firms having contracts with the Government.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; It &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*352&lt;/span&gt; has touched countless hundreds of men and women and ruined many. It is an un-American practice which we should condemn. It deprives men of "liberty" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, for one of man's most precious liberties is his right to work. When a man is deprived of that "liberty" without a fair trial, he is denied due process. If he were condemned by Congress and made ineligible for government employment, he would suffer a bill of attainder, outlawed by the Constitution. See &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lovett,&lt;/i&gt; 328 U. S. 303. An administrative agency&#151;the creature of Congress&#151;certainly cannot exercise powers that Congress itself is barred from asserting. See the opinion of MR. JUSTICE BLACK in &lt;i&gt;Anti-Fascist Committee&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McGrath,&lt;/i&gt; 341 U. S. 123, 144-146.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who see the force of this position counter by saying that the Government's sources of information must be protected, if the campaign against subversives is to be successful. The answer is plain. If the sources of information need protection, they should be kept secret. But once they are used to destroy a man's reputation and deprive him of his "liberty," they must be put to the test of due process of law. The use of faceless informers is wholly at war with that concept. When we relax our standards to accommodate the faceless informer, we violate our basic constitutional guarantees and ape the tactics of those whom we despise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*353&lt;/span&gt; MR. JUSTICE REED, with whom MR. JUSTICE BURTON joins, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS that the Court's reason for annulling Dr. Peters' discharge is not sound. In addition to the reasons stated by him, I find other factors that, to me, strengthen the view that the action of the Loyalty Review Board was not invalid. However, I do not express any opinion on the constitutional problems which might ultimately be faced if the Court had found that the Review Board's action and all other nonconstitutional aspects of the case were proper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive Order No. 9835 was issued by the President on March 21, 1947. By this order he established the Loyalty Review Board and granted to it certain rule-making powers. Part III, &#167; 1 b, Exec. Order No. 9835. The Review Board's first promulgation of regulations pursuant to this power included the original of Regulation 14, which provided that the Board had the right "on its own motion" to review the decisions of the department or agency loyalty boards "even though no appeal has been taken." 13 Fed. Reg. 255 (adopted December 17, 1947). Thus, from the very outset, the procedure followed by the Review Board in reviewing these cases was part of the loyalty program. Furthermore, from 1948 through 1952, in each of the Annual Reports of the Civil Service Commission, the results of the Review Board's post-audit actions under Regulation 14 were unmistakably recorded.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; These reports were submitted to the President pursuant to statutory requirement.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; In addition to stating annual data on general post-audit reviews (more than 5,000 in 1952), the reports clearly indicated that the Board was rehearing cases on its own motion, such as the present, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*354&lt;/span&gt; where the decision of the agency loyalty board had been favorable to the employee.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; The Court places emphasis on the number of cases so handled, but this hardly seems relevant in view of the fact that the reports indisputably conveyed to any reader the fact of what the Board was doing, whether in 1 case or 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court in this case is reviewing a Presidential Order and rules made thereunder. I do not find it as easy as does the majority to analogize such review to judicial review of congressional Acts and administrative interpretation of such Acts. Certain differences are immediately apparent. The Executive Branch is traditionally free to handle its internal problems of administration in its own way. The legality of judicial review of such intra-executive operations as this is, for me, not completely free from doubt. However, construing the Loyalty Order as the Court does, like a statute, the contemporaneous construction of the Order by the Review Board in promulgating Regulation 14, and the action of the President in allowing the regulation and practices thereunder to continue after having notice from the Civil Service Commission reports, lead me to conclude that the Board by Regulation 14 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*355&lt;/span&gt; correctly interpreted the Presidential intention conveyed by Executive Order 9835. Such reasonable interpretation promptly adopted and long-continued by the President and the Board should be respected by the courts. That has been judicial practice heretofore.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor does comparison of Regulation 14 with the Order show, in my opinion, that the Regulation is "inconsistent with" any of the provisions of the Order. Rather the power of the Review Board to review under Regulation 14 appears to be supplemental to the other procedures which the Order itself prescribes. Therefore Regulation 14 constituted merely an implementation of the Order which the Review Board is specifically authorized to make under Part III, &#167; 1b, set out in the Court's opinion, p. 340. Neither of the parties has contended otherwise before this Court. They also agree that the Board's action was valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly the President had knowledge and approved of the Regulation. This is shown by his specific recognition of such cases in his own 1953 Order.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; That Order, while not controlling Dr. Peters' case directly, since it did not become effective until after the Review Board had heard his case, recognized that the Review Board had been and could review decisions which had been favorable to an employee. This action by the President amounts to approval of the practice of the Review Board under Regulation 14. I am therefore compelled to conclude that the action of the Review Board in rendering its advisory recommendation in this case was not invalid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*356&lt;/span&gt; The Court seems to imply, however, that the Review Board's decision was more than merely a recommendation to the head of the department employing Dr. Peters and that the Board, in another "unwarranted assumption of power," by its letter of May 22, 1953, erroneously separated Dr. Peters from the government service. Nowhere in the majority opinion does it appear that Secretary Hobby or the Department she heads, and for whom Dr. Peters worked, ever took any action in regard to the Review Board's recommendation. The reference to this May 22 letter is apt to mislead, as it has nothing to do with the Department's discharge of Dr. Peters, the validity of which is the issue in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that the Review Board's letter of May 22, 1953, may have been erroneous. Under Civil Service Rule V, &#167; 5.101 (a),&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; federal employees found disqualified for federal employment because of a reasonable doubt as to their loyalty are barred from the federal competitive service for three years. This "final determination" as to loyalty is and can be made only by the head of a department or agency on recommendation of a loyalty board.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*357&lt;/span&gt; When the head of a department acts on the Review Board's recommendation, &#167; 5.101 (a) becomes effective. The Review Board, acting as an agency of the Civil Service Commission, then notifies the employee of his disqualification. Assuming that the Review Board was not notified of any "final determination" prior to the letter of May 22, it was sent erroneously. However, it amounted to no more than a nullity and Dr. Peters lost nothing. It is undisputed that on June 12, 1953, the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service, a subordinate of Secretary Hobby, "notified plaintiff of his separation from his position as Special Consultant."&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; This was the notification which effectively separated him from government service and which is the basis for his complaint for wrongful discharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limiting myself to issues decided by the majority, I dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The standards must be specific enough to assure that innocent employees will not fall within the purview of the disloyalty criteria. Every mature consideration was invoked by the Commission to afford maximum protection to the government from disloyal employees while safeguarding the individual employee with a maximum protection from ill-advised accusations of disloyalty."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[20]  As of June 30, 1953, the Board had undertaken in only 58 cases to "hold a hearing and reach its own decision" despite a favorable determination below. Annual Reports of the Civil Service Commission: 1948 (p. 18), 1949 (p. 37), 1950 (pp. 33-34), 1951 (p. 36), 1952 (p. 56), 1953 (p. 31). Of these 58 cases, 20 resulted in reversal of the favorable determination. 1953 Report, p. 31, n. 1. Of these 20 cases, 12&#151;including petitioner's&#151;arose in the fiscal year immediately preceding June 30, 1953. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 31. In the remaining 38 cases&#151;those in which the Board did not reverse the favorable determination &#151;either the Board affirmed the favorable determination or the employee resigned prior to the scheduled hearing. Thus in the 1953 fiscal year, of the 22 hearings scheduled, 8 resulted in affirmance and 2 were cancelled because of resignation. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"On and after the effective date of this order the Loyalty Review Board established by Executive Order No. 9835 of March 21, 1947, shall not accept agency findings for review, upon appeal or otherwise. Appeals pending before the Loyalty Review Board on such date shall be heard to final determination in accordance with the provisions of the said Executive Order No. 9835, as amended. Agency determinations favorable to the officer or employee concerned pending before the Loyalty Review Board on such date shall be acted upon by such Board, and whenever the Board is not in agreement with such favorable determination the case shall be remanded to the department or agency concerned for determination in accordance with the standards and procedures established pursuant to this order."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[24]  Approximately 15% of all federal employees are excepted from "the competitive service." 1954 Annual Report, United States Civil Service Commission, p. 10. Petitioner himself was not employed in "the competitive service." His position was classified in "Schedule A," an exempt category. 5 CFR &#167; 6.101 (n); 5 CFR &#167; 6.1 (d).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[25]  On December 17, 1948, the Board issued the following directive, entitled "Legal effect of advisory recommendations," to the departments and agencies covered by the Order:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The President expects that loyalty policies, procedures, and standards will be uniformly applied in the adjudication of loyalty cases by the several agencies, and the responsibility for coordinating the program and assuring uniformity has been placed in the Loyalty Review Board. The recommendations of the Civil Service Commission in cases of employees covered by section 14 of the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 are mandatory, and the loyalty of persons not covered by section 14 should be judged by the same standards. Therefore, if uniformity is to be attained &lt;i&gt;it is necessary that the head of an agency follow the recommendation of the Loyalty Review Board in all cases.&lt;/i&gt;" (Italics added.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 Fed. Reg. 9372, 5 CFR &#167; 220.4 (d). See Bontecou, The Federal Loyalty-Security Program (1953), 54-55. Compare &lt;i&gt;Kutcher&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gray,&lt;/i&gt; 91 U. S. App. D. C. 266, 199 F. 2d 783.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Berle, The 20th Century Capitalist Revolution (1954), pp. 92-93, traces the impact of the loyalty program on employees of corporations having contracts with the Government:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To begin, let us deal with a situation in which a powerful corporation is under a contract duty to the United States government, or some agency of it, to fire or decline to hire individuals designated to them as possible security risks. In practice they mean that a man who may have been employed for years, being suspect for some reason, is designated to the appropriate authorities [of the corporation]. Things then happen to him rapidly. All he knows is that he is called into the office one day and told that he is discharged&#151;or at best transferred to some far less desirable job. If the ban is complete, and he lives in any of the cities in which the corporation is a preponderant employer, the consequences are extreme. The main avenue of employment is closed to him. He must move into some other city and find some other job if he can. Since the same ban will probably follow him into any other plant engaged in defense orders, the going is rough. If he is a young man, he winds up in some recognizably marginal job, such as dishwashing or unskilled labor. If he is a man in middle life, he may end on the industrial scrap heap. Probably he never discovers exactly what hit him. The personnel people of the corporations do not confide to him their reasons for action."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[3]  "During the fiscal year 1952, the Loyalty Review Board post-audited 5,335 cases which had been decided favorably by agencies and regional loyalty boards. The Board authorized the closing of 5,259 of these cases upon finding that proper procedures had been followed. In 66 other cases, however, further processing was necessary to ensure compliance with standard procedures, and so the cases were remanded to boards in the agencies or in civil-service regions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Board scheduled review of the other 10 cases on their merits and offered to hear the individuals concerned before rendering its decision on their cases. One case was closed as incomplete when the individual resigned. Action on the other 9 cases was completed; since this type of review of a case under Regulation 14 is similar to the consideration given an appeal, the cases of these individuals are included in the following section, which shows action on appeals received by the Loyalty Review Board." 69th Annual Report (1952), Civil Service Commission, p. 56.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Argued March 3, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided June 6, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stuart Rothman&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Ralph S. Spritzer, Bessie Margolin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Sylvia S. Ellison.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eberhard P. Deutsch&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Rene H. Himel, Jr.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*428&lt;/span&gt; MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner brought this suit under &#167; 17 of the Fair Labor Standards Act (52 Stat. 1060, as amended, 63 Stat. 910, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 201 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt;) to enjoin respondent from violating &#167; 15 (a) (2) and &#167; 15 (a) (5) of the Act. Those sections make unlawful violation of &#167; 7 and &#167; 11 (c) of the Act. Section 7 requires one and a half times the regular rate of pay for work in excess of 40 hours a week; and &#167; 11 (c) requires the keeping of the records that are prescribed by regulations. 29 CFR, 1954 Cum. Supp., &#167; 516.1 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; The contention is that respondent's violations of &#167; 7 and &#167; 11 (c) relate to work performed in the construction of an earthwork embankment and concrete platform for the Algiers Lock in Orleans Parish, Louisiana, a unit in the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, extending from Florida to the Mexican border. The Algiers Lock is designed to furnish better passage into and across the Mississippi than is provided by the present Harvey Lock and Canal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent concedes that some of its employees on the Algiers Lock were employed for more than 40 hours per week without payment for overtime. Its defense is that its employees working on the Algiers Lock were not engaged in interstate commerce, and thus were not covered by the Act.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence at the trial was primarily directed to the question whether those working on the Algiers Lock were engaged in commerce within the meaning of &#167; 7 of the Act. As already noted, the Algiers Lock will form part of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. It is designed to serve as an alternate route to the Harvey Lock and Canal. Relying on our decision in &lt;i&gt;Raymond&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chicago, M. &amp;amp; St. P. R.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*429&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 243 U. S. 43, the District Court held that respondent's employees were not engaged in commerce and denied injunctive relief. 113 F. Supp. 235. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed &lt;i&gt;per curiam.&lt;/i&gt; 214 F. 2d 132. To resolve an apparent conflict with &lt;i&gt;Tobin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pennington-Winter Const. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 198 F. 2d 334, we granted certiorari. 348 U. S. 886.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 7 of the Act makes the 40-hour week and the overtime provisions applicable to the Algiers Lock and Canal project if the respondent's employees at work on it are "engaged in commerce." It is argued that they are not engaged "in commerce," since the Algiers Lock is new construction and therefore in the category of the new tunnel that was being constructed in &lt;i&gt;Raymond&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chicago, M. &amp;amp; St. P. R. Co., supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; In the latter case, the Court held that an employee at work on a new tunnel for an interstate carrier was not subject to the Federal Employer's Liability Act, even though the tunnel, when completed, would be an interstate facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not think that case should control this one. We are dealing with a different Act of another vintage&#151;one that has been given a liberal construction from &lt;i&gt;Kirschbaum Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Walling,&lt;/i&gt; 316 U. S. 517, to &lt;i&gt;Alstate Construction Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Durkin,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 13. The question whether an employee is engaged "in commerce" within the meaning of the present Act is determined by practical considerations, not by technical conceptions. See &lt;i&gt;Walling&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jacksonville Paper Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 317 U. S. 564, 570; &lt;i&gt;Overstreet&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;North Shore Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 318 U. S. 125, 128, 130. The test is whether the work is so directly and vitally related to the functioning of an instrumentality or facility of interstate commerce as to be, in practical effect, a part of it, rather than isolated, local activity. See &lt;i&gt;McLeod&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Threlkeld,&lt;/i&gt; 319 U. S. 491, 497. Repair of facilities of interstate commerce is activity "in commerce" within the meaning of the Act, as we held in &lt;i&gt;Fitzgerald Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pedersen,&lt;/i&gt; 324 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*430&lt;/span&gt; U. S. 720. And we think the work of improving existing facilities of interstate commerce, involved in the present case, falls in the same category.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway is an existing instrumentality of commerce. Without Algiers Lock, it has proved inadequate where it crosses the Mississippi. Harvey Lock cannot handle the traffic. Use of Harvey Lock entails travel through some five miles of the New Orleans harbor, already heavy with traffic. It is impractical to widen Harvey Lock because it is located in a highly developed industrial section of New Orleans. Algiers Lock is conceived as the practical alternative for relieving the congestion of the Waterway at this point. See S. Doc. No. 188, 78th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 1-4. The work on Algiers Lock seems to us to have as intimate a relation to improvement of navigation on the Waterway as the dredging of Harvey Lock would have. It is part of the redesigning of an existing facility of interstate commerce. Those working on the Algiers Lock are therefore "engaged in commerce" within the meaning of &#167; 7 of the Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE MINTON, with whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER joins, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only injunctive relief is sought here by the Secretary of Labor to prevent the violation of &#167;&#167; 7 and 15 (a) (2) and &#167;&#167; 11 (c) and 15 (a) (5) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 201 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; which require the payment &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*431&lt;/span&gt; by employers of extra pay for overtime work and the keeping of records by them. 29 U. S. C. &#167; 207 (a) provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;". . . [N]o employer shall employ any of his employees who is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce for a workweek longer than forty hours, unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is contended that the respondent and its employees who were constructing this cutoff canal were "engaged in commerce." If they were not so engaged, an injunction will not lie. This presents a question of statutory construction in light of legislative, administrative, and judicial considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U. S. C. &#167; 51 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; provides that every railway common carrier while engaged in interstate commerce shall be liable in damages to any employee engaged in such commerce who suffers injury resulting from the negligence of the carrier. If the employee was not himself engaged in commerce, there can be no recovery under the Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Raymond&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chicago, M. &amp;amp; St. P. R. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 243 U. S. 43, the company was engaged in the operation of a railroad between Chicago and Seattle. Its existing route went around the mountains, and the railroad sought to tunnel through the mountains. While constructing this tunnel, Raymond was injured and sued the railroad under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, claiming he was engaged in commerce when injured by the railroad's negligence. This Court held that Raymond was not engaged in commerce while working on the construction of this cutoff tunnel because its use in commerce was only &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*432&lt;/span&gt; contemplated after completion. That is the exact situation here with reference to this canal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;New York Central R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;White,&lt;/i&gt; 243 U. S. 188, a railroad was constructing a new station alongside its interstate line. White was a night watchman employed at the site of this new construction and was killed. His representative sued under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, claiming that he was engaged in commerce, but this Court held that he was not engaged in commerce as he went about his duties at the site of this new construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interpretation and application of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the federal courts have adopted the rule of the &lt;i&gt;Raymond&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;White&lt;/i&gt; cases, which arose under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. A prerequisite to the application of either Act was that the employee be engaged in commerce. This rule came to be known as the "new construction rule" and was applied by this Court in &lt;i&gt;Murphey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Reed,&lt;/i&gt; 335 U. S. 865. It was also applied by the First Circuit in &lt;i&gt;Nieves&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Standard Dredging Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 152 F. 2d 719, where the employer was dredging a channel for navigation in a previously nonnavigable stream. The Second Circuit in &lt;i&gt;Scholl&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McWilliams Dredging Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 169 F. 2d 729, applied the rule where the employer was engaged in the construction of a new air base in Greenland that had not yet been used in foreign commerce. The Third Circuit applied the rule in &lt;i&gt;Kelly&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ford, Bacon &amp;amp; Davis, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 162 F. 2d 555, where the employer was engaged in building a new plant for the construction of aircraft engines later to be used in commerce, but which plant was only an additional facility for such work. It was held in this case that the employer was not only not engaged in commerce, but it was not engaged in the production of goods for commerce. The Fifth Circuit, in another case beside the one under consideration, applied &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*433&lt;/span&gt; the rule of new construction to the building of an expressway which, when completed, would have routed over it several interstate highways. &lt;i&gt;Van Klaveren&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Killian-House Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 210 F. 2d 510. The Sixth Circuit in &lt;i&gt;Koepfle&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Garavaglia,&lt;/i&gt; 200 F. 2d 191, applied the rule to another case of new construction of an expressway to be later integrated into a highway system. The Eighth Circuit in &lt;i&gt;Crabb&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Welden Bros.,&lt;/i&gt; 164 F. 2d 797, applied the rule in the construction of the Alcan Highway. The Tenth Circuit in &lt;i&gt;Moss&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gillioz Const. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 206 F. 2d 819, similarly applied the rule in the construction of a new bridge at 51st Street, south of Tulsa, Oklahoma, over which interstate traffic then using the 11th Street Bridge could be routed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agencies responsible for the administration of the Act had interpreted it as not applying to new construction not yet used in interstate commerce. Wage and Hour Interpretative Bulletin No. 5, &#182; 12, Dec. 2, 1938; BNA, 1944-1945 WH Man. 23:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The question arises whether the employees of builders and contractors are entitled to the benefits of the Act. The employees of local construction contractors generally are not engaged in interstate commerce and do not produce any goods which are shipped or sold across State lines. Thus, it is our opinion that employees engaged in the original construction of buildings are not generally within the scope of the Act, even if the buildings when completed will be used to produce goods for commerce. . . ."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Wage Hour Manual, Bureau of National Affairs Labor Relations Reporter, Vol. 6, 10:237, the rule is interpreted as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In interpreting the Act's application to employers in the building and construction industry, the Wage &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*434&lt;/span&gt; and Hour Division and the courts have drawn a distinction between the original construction of buildings or facilities and their repair or reconstruction."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not dealing here with improving or repairing existing facilities which are already in commerce, but with new construction that has never been used in commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems, therefore, that the Secretary of Labor has quite recently changed his mind about the application of the Act to new construction not yet used or not an integral part of interstate commerce. His change of mind should not change the law. This Court, which may change the law, seems to have changed its mind about the same time and without saying why it does so, except that the foregoing cases are of a different vintage. I am unable to distinguish the cases on the vintage test. Without overruling the &lt;i&gt;Raymond, White&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Murphey&lt;/i&gt; decisions and the number of cases decided by the Circuit Courts, this Court brushes them off as of another vintage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliance upon this Court's opinions becomes a hazardous business for lawyers and judges, not to mention contractors, who are not familiar with the vintage test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The only question presented and argued here concerns &#167; 7 of the Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The construction work held in &lt;i&gt;Murphey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Reed,&lt;/i&gt; 335 U. S. 865, not to be under the Act was the building of a Navy base, not the improvement of a facility or instrumentality of interstate commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p1"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;As in First Iowa Hydro-Electric Coop. v. Federal Power Commission, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x18/first-iowa-coop-v-power-commn/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;328&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;152&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 66 S.Ct. 906, 90 L.Ed. 1143, this case illustrates the integration of the federal and state jurisdictions in licensing water power projects under the Federal Power Act.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; In the First Iowa case we sustained the authority of the Commission to license a power project to use navigable waters of the United States located in Iowa. Here, without finding that the waters are navigable, the Commission has issued a comparable license for a power project to use waters on lands constituting reservations of the United States located in Oregon. The State of Oregon questions the authority of the Commission to do this and the adequacy of the provisions approved by the Commission for the conservation of anadromous fish.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; For the reasons hereafter stated, we sustain the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p2"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In 1949, the Northwest Power Supply Company of Portland, Oregon, applied to the Federal Power Commission for a license to construct, operate and maintain a hydroelectric plant, constituting Pelton Project No. 2030, on reserved lands of the United States on the Deschutes River in Oregon,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; and, in 1951, the Portland General Electric Company of Portland, Oregon, succeeded to a supplementary application for that license.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p3"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Pelton Project is designed to include a concrete dam 205 feet high and a powerhouse containing three 36,000-kilowatt generators. It is to be built across the Deschutes River on reserved lands of the United States located below the junction of its Metolius and Crooked River tributaries.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; The western terminus of the dam is to occupy lands, within the Warm Springs Indian Reservation, which have been reserved by the United States for power purposes since 1910 and 1913.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="fn5_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; The eastern terminus of the dam is to be on lands of the United States which, at least since 1909, have been withdrawn from entry under the public land laws and reserved for power purposes.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6" id="fn6_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; The project calls for no permanent diversion of water as the entire flow of the river will run through or over the dam into the natural bed of the stream. This dam will make available the head and volume of water required for the project and the water impounded by it will create a narrow reservoir, submerging lands the title to which is or will be in the United States. Variations and interruptions in the flow of the stream, caused by temporary storage or use of water for power purposes, are to be controlled by a 'reregulating dam' approved by the Commission and located on private property, to be acquired, about three miles below the power dam. No objection is made to the reregulating dam. To the extent that access to existing spawning grounds for anadromous fish is cut off by the power dam, other facilities on private property, to be acquired, are to be constructed and maintained on terms approved by the Commission and designed to develop an equal or greater fish population. Opportunities for recreational uses of the area are to be enhanced and no issue as to water pollution is before us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p4"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The State of Oregon, the Fish Commission of Oregon, the Oregon State Game Commission and the Oregon Division of the Izaak Walton League intervened before the Commission and each filed objections to the granting of the license. Some of their objections related to the authority of the Commission to grant the license and others to the suitability of the proposed fish conservation facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p5"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Following extended hearings, the Commission's presiding examiner recommended the license. After exceptions to that recommendation the Commission issued its opinion and an order granting the license. 10 F.P.C. 445, 450, 92 P.U.R. (N.S.) 247. The Commission found that a public need exists for the early completion of the project to meet a severe power shortage in the Pacific Northwest. It found also that the project is in the public interest, will provide for comprehensive development of the affected stretch of the Deschutes River, and will be consistent with further comprehensive development of that stream and of the Columbia Basin. It held that the improvements will contribute valuable public benefits which will not be available if the river is maintained in its present natural condition.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn7" id="fn7_ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; The Commission stated that the project will be subject to all existing rights to the use of the waters of the river, whether perfected or not. It prescribed temporary measures to be taken to meet the needs of the anadromous fish during the construction of the project and approved certain permanent facilities, practices and expenditures in relation to such fish. The opinion stated 'that no substantial evidence has been brought forward to show that the facilities proposed for conserving the fish will not maintain existing runs. Moreover, there are indications that the runs can be increaed.' 10 F.P.C., at 450, 92 P.U.R. (N.S.), at 252.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p6"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;A rehearing being denied, the State and its agencies sought a review by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the Portland General Electric Company intervened. That court, with one judge dissenting, set aside the Commission's order. 211 F.2d 347. It recognized the necessity of a license from the Federal Power Commission but held that Congress, by its public lands legislation, long ago had transferred to the State of Oregon such control over the use of nonnavigable waters that the sponsor of the Pelton Project must secure also the permission prescribed by the State. We granted certiorari because of the public significance of the issues but denied leave to the Portland General Electric Company to intervene here. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;348&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;868&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 75 S.Ct. 112. 28 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1254(1); 49 Stat. 860&amp;#8212;861, 16 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 825l(b), 16 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 825l(b). Several States filed briefs as amici curiae, usually adopting as their own the brief filed by respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p7"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;We divide our consideration of the issues into three parts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class="indent"&gt;I. Applicability of The Federal Power Act&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p8"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;On its face, the Federal Power Act applies to this license as specifically as it did to the license in the First Iowa case. There the jurisdiction of the Commission turned almost entirely upon the navigability of the waters of the United States to which the license applied. Here the jurisdiction turns upon the ownership or control by the United States of the reserved lands on which the licensed project is to be located.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn8" id="fn8_ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; The authority to issue licenses in relation to navigable waters of the United States springs from the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. The authority to do so in relation to public lands and reservations of the United States springs from the Property Clause&amp;#8212;'The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States * * *.' Art. IV, &amp;#167; 3.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn9" id="fn9_ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p9"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In the instant case the project is to occupy lands which come within the term 'reservations,' as distinguished from 'public lands.' In the Federal Power Act, each has its established meaning. 'Public lands' are lands subject to private appropriation and disposal under public land laws. 'Reservations' are not so subject.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn10" id="fn10_ref"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; The title to the lands upon which the eastern terminus of the dam is to rest has been in the United States since the cession by Great Britain of the area now comprising the State of Oregon. Even if formerly they may have been open to private appropriation as 'public lands,' they were withdrawn from such availability before any vested interests conflicting with the Pelton Project were acquired.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn11" id="fn11_ref"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt; Title to the bed of the Deschutes River is also in the United States.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn12" id="fn12_ref"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt; Since the Indian Treaty of 1855, the lands within the Indian reservation, upon which the western end of the dam will rest, have been reserved for the use of the Indians. More recently they were reserved for power purposes&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn13" id="fn13_ref"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; and the Indians have given their consent to the project before us. Accordingly, there is no issue here as to whether or not the title to the tribal lands is in the United States.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn14" id="fn14_ref"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p10"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;There thus remains no question as to the constitutional and statutory authority of the Federal Power Commission to grant a valid license for a power project on reserved lands of the United States, provided that, as required by the Act, the use of the water does not conflict with vested rights of others.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn15" id="fn15_ref"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt; To allow Oregon to veto such use, by requiring the State's additional permission, would result in the very duplication of regulatory control precluded by the First Iowa decision. &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x18/first-iowa-coop-v-power-commn/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;328&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;152&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 177 179, 66 S.Ct. 906, 918. No such duplication of authority is called for by the Act.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn16" id="fn16_ref"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt; The Court of Appeals in the instant case agrees. 211 F.2d at page 351. And see State of Washington Department of Game v. Federal Power Commission, 9 Cir., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca9/2c8k/state-of-washington-department-of-game-v-federal-p/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;207&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;391&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 395&amp;#8212;396. Authorization of this project, therefore, is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission, unless that jurisdiction is modified by other federal legislation. See United States v. Rio Grande Dam &amp;amp; Irrigation Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ugx/united-states-v-rio-grande-dam-irrigation-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;174&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;690&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 703, 19 S.Ct. 770, 775, 43 L.Ed. 1136; Gutierres v. Albuquerque Land &amp;amp; Irrigation Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/utM/gutierres-v-albuquerque-land-irrigation-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;188&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;545&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 554, 23 S.Ct. 338, 341, 47 L.Ed. 588.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p11"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;II. Inapplicability of the Desert Land Act of 1877 and Related Acts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p12"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The State of Oregon argues that the Acts of July 26, 1866,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn17" id="fn17_ref"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt; July 9, 1870,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn18" id="fn18_ref"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt; and the Desert Land Act of 1877&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn19" id="fn19_ref"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt; constitute an express congressional delegation or conveyance to the State of the power to regulate the use of these waters. The argument is that these Acts preclude or restrict the scope of the jurisdiction, otherwise apparent on the face of the Federal Power Act, and require the consent of the State to a project such as the one before us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p13"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The nature and effect of these Acts have been discussed previously by this Court. The purpose of the Acts of 1866 and 1870 was governmental recognition and sanction of possessory rights on public lands asserted under local laws and customs. Jennison v. Kirk, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/sHP/jennison-v-kirk/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;98&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;453&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 25 L.Ed. 240. The Desert Land Act severed, for purposes of private acquisition, soil and water rights on public lands, and provided that such water rights were to be acquired in the manner provided by the law of the State of location. California-Oregon Power Co. v. Beaver Portland Cement Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wsh/california-oregon-power-co-v-beaver-portland-cemen/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;295&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;142&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 55 S.Ct. 725, 79 L.Ed. 1356. See also, State of Nebraska v. State of Wyoming, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;325&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;589&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 611&amp;#8212;616, 65 S.Ct. 1332, 1347&amp;#8212;1350, 89 L.Ed. 1815.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p14"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It is not necessary for us, in the instant case, to pass upon the question whether this legislation constitutes the express delegation or conveyance of power that is claimed by the State, because these Acts are not applicable to the reserved lands and waters here involved. The Desert Land Act covers 'sources of water supply upon the public lands * * *.' The lands before us in this case are not 'public lands' but 'reservations.' Even without that express restriction of the Desert Land Act to sources of water supply on public lands, these Acts would not apply to reserved lands. 'It is a familiar principle of public land law that statutes providing generally for disposal of the public domain are inapplicable to lands which are not unqualifiedly subject to sale and disposition because they have been appropriated to some other purpose.' United States v. O'Donnell, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wBN/united-states-v-odonnell/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;303&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;501&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 510, 58 S.Ct. 708, 714, 82 L.Ed. 980. See also, United States v. State of Minnesota, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/vXN/united-states-v-minnesota/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;270&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;181&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 206, 46 S.Ct. 298, 305, 70 L.Ed. 539. The instant lands certainly 'are not unqualifiedly subject to sale and disposition * * *.' Accordingly, it is enough, for the instant case, to recognize that these Acts do not apply to this license, which relates only to the use of waters on reservations of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p15"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;III. Application of the Federal Power Act to This Project&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p16"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Finally, respondents question the discretion used by the Commission in granting the license. They point to the consequences which the project will have beyond the limits of the reserved lands on which it will be located.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p17"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The first consequence is the inevitable variation in, or the temporary interruption of, the flow of the stream. The Commission is satisfied that it has overcome this objection by its provision for a reregulating dam. It has approved the technical features involved and the site for that dam will be acquired in accordance with the property laws of Oregon.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn20" id="fn20_ref"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; In this reregulation of the flow of the stream, the Commission acts on behalf of the people of Oregon, as well as all others, in seeing to it that the interests of all concerned are acequately protected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p18"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;There remains the effect of the project upon anadromous fish which use these waters as spawning grounds. All agree that the 205-foot dam will cut off access of some fish to their natural spawning grounds above the dam and that such interruption cannot be overcome by fish ladders.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn21" id="fn21_ref"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt; However, the State does not flatly prohibit the construction of dams that cut off anadromous fish from their spawning or breeding grounds.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn22" id="fn22_ref"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt; One alternative, thus recognized, is the supplying of new breeding pools to which the fish can be removed at appropriate times.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn23" id="fn23_ref"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt; The Fish Commission of Oregon has denied a permit to the Portland General Electric Company to carry out its present proposal but there appears to be no disagreement as to the underlying principle involved.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn24" id="fn24_ref"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p19"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The applicant has agreed to provide facilities for conserving the runs of anadromous fish in accordance with plans approved by the Federal Power Commission. The capital cost of these facilities and of the reregulating dam, to be borne by the applicant, is estimated at $4,430,000. The total annual cost due to these facilities is estimated at $795,000. The Commission has found each of these estimates to be reasonable. Of the $795,000 annual cost, the applicant will bear $410,000 (cost of borrowed money, depreciation and taxes on the capital investment), and the $10,000 maintenance cost of the reregulating dam. In addition, it has offered to contribute $100,000 annually toward the estimated $375,000 cost of operation and maintenance of the fish conservation facilities, and the Commission has retained the power to fix the amount of the applicant's contribution if a sum is not agreed upon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p20"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The care given to the preparation of this conservation program and the large investment to be made in it are impressive. It also is of interest that the Fish Commission of Oregon already is operating somewhat comparable but smaller facilities of this kind on the Metolius River.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p21"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;One argument against the project goes beyond the need to conserve the existing fish population. It is argued that the project will preclude the carrying out of certain plans for the Columbia River Basin which contemplate greatly enlarging the fish population in the Deschutes River area, by concentrating there other runs of fish not now using that river. While such an argument may properly be directed to the Federal Power Commission or to Congress, it is not one for us to answer upon the basis of existing legal rights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p22"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;We conclude, therefore, that, on the facts here presented, the Federal Power Act is applicable in accordance with its terms, and that the Federal Power Commission has acted within its powers and its discretion in granting the license now before us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p23"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p24"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Justice HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;I would not suppose the United States could erect a dam on this nonnavigable river without obtaining its water rights in accordance with state law. If I am right in that assumption, then this dam cannot be built without satisfying Oregon's water-rights law. For the federal licensee who will build this dam acquires all its rights from the United States. And the United States cannot give what it does not have.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1-1" id="fn1-1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p28"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The argument pressed on us by the United States is akin to the one urged in State of Nebraska v. State of Wyoming, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;325&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;589&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 611 et seq., 65 S.Ct. 1332, 1347, 89 L.Ed. 1815. In that case, the United States struggled to be rid of the rule of law that made its water rights on nonnavigable streams of the West dependent on state law. It claimed that it owned all the unappropriated water in the basin of the North Platte River. The argument was made not only under the Reclamation Act of 1902, 32 Stat. 388, but also under the Desert Land Act of 1877, 19 Stat. 377, the Act involved here. We reserved decision as to whether under some circumstances the United States might be the owner of unappropriated water rights. But we held that under those Acts the United States took its water rights like other landowners, viz., pursuant to state law governing appropriation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p29"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Unless we are to depart from that ruling, we must accept Oregon's claim here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p30"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Oregon's position has for its support two other decisions of this Court, both construing the Desert Land Act. The first of these is California-Oregon Power Co. v. Beaver Portland Cement Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wsh/california-oregon-power-co-v-beaver-portland-cemen/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;295&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;142&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 55 S.Ct. 725, 728, 79 L.Ed. 1356, which construed the provision of the Desert Land Act, crucial here, which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p31"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'all surplus water over and above such actual appropriation      and use, together with the water of all lakes, rivers and      other sources of water supply upon the public lands and not      navigable, shall remain and be held free for the      appropriation and use of the public for irrigation, mining      and manufacturing purposes subject to existing rights.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p32"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Court interpreted that provision as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p33"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'The fair construction of the provision now under review is      that Congress intended to establish the rule that for the      future the land should be patented separately; and that all      non-navigable waters thereon should be reserved for the use      of the public under the laws of the states and territories      named.' &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wsh/california-oregon-power-co-v-beaver-portland-cemen/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;295&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;142&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 162, 55 S.Ct. 725, 731.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p34"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;That case, to be sure, involved a contest between private owners. But the principle announced was shortly applied to the United States as a property owner on a nonnavigable stream.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2-1" id="fn2-1_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; In Ickes v. Fox, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wxD/ickes-v-fox/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;300&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;82&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 57 S.Ct. 412, 81 L.Ed. 525, the Court held that by the Desert Land Act, 'if not before, Congress had severed the land and waters constituting the public domain and established the rule that for the future the lands should be patented separately. Acquisition of the government title to a parcel of land was not to carry with it a water right; but all nonnavigable waters were reserved for the use of the public under the laws of the various arid-land states.' Id., 300 U.S. at page 95, 57 S.Ct. 417.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p35"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Fox case involved water rights of farmers under a federal irrigation project, the claim being that the United States, owner of the irrigation system, owned the water rights. The Court rejected that claim and looked to state law to determine who had the water rights; and finding that the farmers owned them, the Court held that the United States was not an indispensable party in litigation concerning them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p36"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;36&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Those cases should control here. The Desert Land Act applies to 'public lands'; and the Federal Power Act, 41 Stat. 1063, as amended, 16 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 791a et seq., 16 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 791a et seq., grants the Commission authority to issue licenses for power development 'upon any part of the public lands and reservations of the United States.' &amp;#167; 4(e). The definition of those terms in the Act says nothing about water rights.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3-1" id="fn3-1_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; And, as I have pointed out, it has been the long-term policy of Congress to separate wastern land from water rights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p37"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;37&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The final resort of the Commission is to the Act of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 847, providing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p38"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;38&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'That the President may, at any time in his discretion,      temporarily withdraw from settlement, location, sale, or      entry any of the public lands of the United States including      the District of Alaska and reserve the same for water-power      sites, irrigation, classification of lands, or other public      purposes to be specified in the orders of withdrawals, and      such withdrawals or reservations shall remain in force until      revoked by him or by an Act of Congress.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p39"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;39&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It was under this Act that some of the lands here involved were reserved for a power site. But the Act of June 25, 1910, by its very terms, did no more than withdraw these public lands 'from settlement, location, sale, or entry.' The Act did not purport to touch or change in any way the provision of the Desert Land Act that pertains to water rights. If the words of the 1910 Act are to control, water rights remained undisturbed. The lands remained 'public lands,' save only that settlers could not locate on them. I assume that the United States could have recalled its grant of jurisdiction over water rights, saving, of course, all vested rights. But the United States has not expressly done so; and we should not construe any law as achieving that result unless the purpose of Congress is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p40"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The reason is that the rule adopted by the Court profoundly affects the economy of many States, ten of whom are here in protest. In the West, the United States owns a vast amount of land in some States, over 50 percent of all the land. If by mere Executive action the federal lands may be reserved and all the water rights appurtenant to them returned to the United States, vast dislocations in the economies of the Western States may follow. For the right of withdrawal of public lands granted by the 1910 Act is not only for 'water-power sites' but for a host of public projects&amp;#8212;'irrigation, classification of lands, or other public purposes.' Federal officials have long sought that authority. It has been consistently denied them. We should deny it again. Certainly the United States could not appropriate the water rights in definance of Oregon law, if it built the dam. It should have no greater authority when it makes a grant to a private power group.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; In 1924, the Columbia Valley Power Company, Inc., had applied to the Federal Power Commission for a license to develop Pelton Project No. 57 at substantially the same site. That license was issued but, due to the licensee's failure to proceed with construction as required by the Commission, it was canceled in 1936.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; The Deschutes River is entirely within the State of Oregon. It drains the eastern slope of the Cascade Range and flows northward, across the lands of the United States here involved, to the Columbia River, which it meets about 15 miles above The Dalles. The Commission has made no findings as to its navigability or as to the relation between its flow and the navigability of other streams. Throughout its lower 130 miles, which include the project site, it flows in a narrow canyon with an average fall of 17.6 feet per mile and, apparently, it is generally recognized as incapable of sustaining navigation. Accordingly, throughout this litigation, the river has been treated by all concerned as not constituting 'navigable waters' of the United States as defined in &amp;#167; 3(8) of the Federal Power Act, 49 Stat. 838, 16 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 796(8), 16 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 796(8). We do not pass either upon that question or upon the relationship to interstate commerce of the proposed use of the waters of the river.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;license, the company referred to these simultaneous state proceedings, which did not reach a conclusion until shortly before the granting of the federal license.

        &lt;p&gt; The Deschutes River is nonnavigable and part of the Columbia River Basin. It is, indeed, a direct tributary of the Columbia. Control of this tributary might be important to an effective flood-control program for the Columbia. If so this dam could find constitutional sanction under the Commerce Clause. See State of Oklahoma ex rel. Phillips v. Guy F. Atkinson Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wMf/oklahoma-ex-rel-phillips-v-guy-f-atkinson-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;313&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;508&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 525, 61 S.Ct. 1050, 1059, 85 L.Ed. 1487. That constitutional power over the Deschutes would not be lost through nonuse or through intervening legislation. In case the constitutional power were exercised, private rights would give way. Oregon could demand compensation for the loss of any water-power rights it possessed. See Federal Power Commission v. Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xgS/fpc-v-niagara-mohawk-power-corp/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;347&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;239&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 254&amp;#8212;255, 74 S.Ct. 487, 496&amp;#8212;497, 98 L.Ed. 686. But Oregon could not assert its regulatory powers to defeat the federal program, for the Supremacy Clause would prevent her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No effort has been made to bring this case under the Commerce Clause. The findings are inadequate for that purpose. The case turns on the authority of the United States as a proprietor.&lt;/p&gt;

But the present project, dealing as it does with nonnavigable waters, is dependent on the state law of water rights for its execution. In the First Iowa Hydro Electric Co-op. case, we recognized the room left for that degree of control by the States in this situation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*459&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Daniel T. Scannell&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the City of New York, as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae,&lt;/i&gt; urging affirmance. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Peter Campbell Brown, Seymour B. Quel&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Helen R. Cassidy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon reargument the Court has come to the conclusion that the writ of certiorari&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; should be dismissed as improvidently granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Court of Appeals denied petitioner's motion for leave to appeal without stating any ground for its decision. 306 N. Y. 981. In these circumstances we must ascertain whether that court's decision "might" have rested on a nonfederal ground, for if it did we must decline to take jurisdiction. &lt;i&gt;Stembridge&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; 343 U. S. 541, 547 (1952); see also &lt;i&gt;Lynch&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York ex rel. Pierson,&lt;/i&gt; 293 U. S. 52, 54 (1934). We approach the matter first by considering what the petitioner has alleged as a basis for the constitutional issues which he asks us to review on the merits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constitutional questions involved are whether respondents, members of the Yonkers Board of Education, in refusing the use of any of the Yonkers public school buildings to the Yonkers Committee for Peace for a forum on "peace and war," discriminated against the Committee, so as to deprive the Committee's members of their rights of freedom of speech, assembly, and equal protection of the laws, under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner concedes that a State may withhold its school facilities altogether from use by nonscholastic groups. It is implicit in this concession that petitioner also recognizes that a State may make reasonable classifications &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*460&lt;/span&gt; in determining the extent to which its schools shall be available for nonscholastic uses, and petitioner has not attacked on this score the classifications made by the applicable New York statute and respondents' regulations.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; The question of whether the regulations are unconstitutionally vague was not raised below, and hence is not open here. Therefore the burden of petitioner's grievance would seem to be that respondents have applied the statute and regulations to similar groups differently than they have to the Committee for Peace. And yet petitioner has failed to allege in his pleading, which upon respondents' motion was dismissed prior to answer, that other organizations of a similar character to the Committee for Peace have been allowed use of the Yonkers schools. The allegations of that pleading simply are that unnamed and undescribed "organizations" have been allowed to use Yonkers school buildings in the past "for the purpose of public assembly and discussion."&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*461&lt;/span&gt; Whether such organizations are in any way comparable to the Committee for Peace nowhere appears in the pleading.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; And what the practice of the Board of Education has been in permitting the nonscholastic use of school buildings is not shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*462&lt;/span&gt; What has been alleged is entirely too amorphous to permit adjudication of the constitutional issues asserted. And we think the most reasonable inference from this record is that the Court of Appeals' denial of petitioner's motion for leave to appeal went on that ground, rather than on the ground, suggested on behalf of respondents, that in proceeding by way of leave to appeal rather than by an appeal as of right the petitioner had followed the wrong appellate route.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; This conclusion is fortified by two additional circumstances. If the Court of Appeals had considered the constitutional issues adequately presented, it presumably would have saved petitioner's right to appeal as of right by putting its denial of leave to appeal on the ground that an appeal lay as of right. See N. Y. Civ. Prac. Act, &#167; 592 (5) (a).&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; Otherwise we would &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*463&lt;/span&gt; have to assume that the Court of Appeals desired to thwart review of the constitutional questions, an assumption wholly unjustified by this record. Furthermore, the decision of New York's intermediate appellate court against the petitioner was because of the insufficiency of his pleading.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the insufficiency of petitioner's pleading was the reason for the Court of Appeals' denial of leave to appeal, the past decisions of this Court still leave room for argument as to whether we should dismiss for lack of jurisdiction because the state court's decision rested on an adequate nonfederal ground. It is established law that this Court is not finally concluded by the state court's determination as to the sufficiency of pleadings asserting a federal right. Some of the cases seem to suggest that the scope of our review is limited to determining whether the state court has by-passed the federal right under forms of local procedure, from which it would seem to follow that if we find that such is not the case we should dismiss for want of jurisdiction. Cf. &lt;i&gt;American Railway Express Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Levee,&lt;/i&gt; 263 U. S. 19, 21 (1923); &lt;i&gt;Davis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wechsler,&lt;/i&gt; 263 U. S. 22, 24 (1923). There can be no suggestion of by-passing in this instance. Other cases, however, indicate that we should accept jurisdiction and decide the sufficiency of the pleadings &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; for ourselves. See &lt;i&gt;Boyd&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Nebraska ex rel. Thayer,&lt;/i&gt; 143 U. S. 135, 180 (1892); &lt;i&gt;Carter&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Texas,&lt;/i&gt; 177 U. S. 442, 447 (1900); &lt;i&gt;First National Bank&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Anderson,&lt;/i&gt; 269 U. S. 341, 346 (1926); &lt;i&gt;Brown&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Western Railway of Alabama,&lt;/i&gt; 338 U. S. 294, 296 (1949). In the present case, the route which we travel would make &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*464&lt;/span&gt; no difference in the result. Even if we were to look at the matter ourselves &lt;i&gt;de novo,&lt;/i&gt; we could not on this vague and empty record decide the constitutional issues sought to be presented. This Court has often refused to decide constitutional questions on an inadequate record. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;International Brotherhood of Teamsters&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Denver Milk Producers, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 334 U. S. 809 (1948); &lt;i&gt;Rescue Army&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Municipal Court,&lt;/i&gt; 331 U. S. 549, 575-585 (1947); &lt;i&gt;Aircraft &amp;amp; Diesel Equipment Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hirsch,&lt;/i&gt; 331 U. S. 752, 762-763 (1947); &lt;i&gt;Alabama State Federation of Labor&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McAdory,&lt;/i&gt; 325 U. S. 450 (1945). In the circumstances of this case, we prefer to rest our decision on the ground that we lack jurisdiction. For if we could not ourselves decide on this record the constitutional issues tendered, we consider that by the same token the New York Court of Appeals was entirely justified in refusing to pass on them, and that we should therefore regard its denial of leave to appeal as resting on an adequate nonfederal ground. See &lt;i&gt;Vandalia R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Indiana ex rel. South Bend,&lt;/i&gt; 207 U. S. 359 (1907); &lt;i&gt;Brinkmeier&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Missouri P. R. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 224 U. S. 268 (1912).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that the writ of certiorari must be dismissed as improvidently granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dismissed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE CLARK dissent, believing that the allegations of the petition are sufficient to state a case of discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Certiorari was granted. 347 U. S. 926. The case was set for reargument both on the merits and as to the jurisdiction of this Court. 348 U. S. 881.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The state statute, insofar as applicable here, allows each board of education to adopt reasonable regulations for the use of school property, when not in use for school purposes, for any of the following purposes: "For holding social, civic and recreational meetings and entertainments, and other uses pertaining to the welfare of the community . . . ," "For meetings, entertainments and occasions where admission fees are charged, when the proceeds thereof are to be expended for an educational or charitable purpose . . ." and "For civic forums and community centers. . . ." N. Y. Education Law, &#167; 414 (3), (4), (6). It is not clear whether this last use is restricted by subsequent language in the section so as to permit only such forums as are established by the board of education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulations adopted by respondents do not enlarge upon these classifications in the statute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  After reciting the respondents' refusal to permit the Committee for Peace to use any of the Yonkers school buildings on two occasions in 1952, the petition goes on to allege:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"14. That pursuant to Section 414 of the Education Law of the State of New York, the respondents, and/or their predecessors, as members of the Board of Education of the City of Yonkers, adopted regulations for the use of the schoolhouses, grounds or other property when not in use for school purposes in Yonkers, New York, whereby organizations at all times herein mentioned were and are permitted the use of the school buildings when not in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"15. That at all times herein mentioned and at all times since the adoption of the aforesaid regulations, the school buildings, grounds and property of and in the City of Yonkers have on numerous occasions (whose number are best known to respondents and at such numerous times and occasions that the practice is an accepted practice) been permitted to be used pursuant to Section 414 of the Education Law by organizations for the purpose of public assembly and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"16. That at no time herein mentioned did the respondents inform petitioner of the reason for the denial of his application, nor did they ask petitioner or his organization to fulfill any further requirements or conditions for permission to use by them of a school building in Yonkers, New York, for purposes of public assembly or discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"17. That by reason of the action of the respondents in failing to give a reason for its action whereas permission is freely granted to others applying, it is evident that the respondents are concealing a design to discriminate against petitioner and his said organization, for which discrimination there is no foundation in law or fact, and that the acts of respondents are arbitrary and unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"18. The action of respondents violates the right of petitioner and the constituent members of his organization of freedom of speech and assembly guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States and denies them the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Constitution of the United States."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  It may be noted that in an affidavit in support of the motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals, petitioner's attorney sought to remedy this vital defect by including the assertion, "that other organizations similar to petitioner's have obtained similar use" of the schools from the Yonkers Board of Education. But it does not appear that petitioner ever sought to amend his pleading in these respects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  New York has two methods of appeal to the Court of Appeals&#151; an appeal as of right and by leave to appeal. An appeal as of right lies, &lt;i&gt;inter alia,&lt;/i&gt; where there is "directly involved the construction of the constitution of the state or of the United States . . . ." N. Y. Const., Art. VI, &#167; 7 (1); N. Y. Civ. Prac. Act, &#167; 588 (1) (a). In all cases in which an appeal does not lie as of right, appeal is by leave of the Appellate Division or the Court of Appeals. N. Y. Const., Art. VI, &#167; 7 (6); N. Y. Civ. Prac. Act, &#167; 589. Had wrong appellate procedure been the reason for the Court of Appeals' denial of leave to appeal, its decision would have rested on an adequate nonfederal ground, depriving this Court of jurisdiction. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Parker&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Illinois,&lt;/i&gt; 333 U. S. 571 (1948); &lt;i&gt;Central Union Telephone Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;City of Edwardsville,&lt;/i&gt; 269 U. S. 190 (1925).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  This section provides that when leave to appeal is denied "upon the ground that the appeal would lie as of right," the appellant is automatically entitled to an additional 30 days after the denial to file an appeal as of right. The Court of Appeals has thus stated its ground of denial in many instances where leave to appeal was denied because an appeal lay as of right. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., In re Arbitration between E. Milius &amp;amp; Co. and Regal Shirt Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 305 N. Y. 562, 111 N. E. 2d 438 (1953); &lt;i&gt;In re Brinn,&lt;/i&gt; 305 N. Y. 626, 111 N. E. 2d 738 (1953); &lt;i&gt;In re Wuttke,&lt;/i&gt; 305 N. Y. 694, 112 N. E. 2d 777 (1953); &lt;i&gt;In re Hecht,&lt;/i&gt; 305 N. Y. 800, 113 N. E. 2d 553 (1953); &lt;i&gt;Auten&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Auten,&lt;/i&gt; 306 N. Y. 752, 118 N. E. 2d 110 (1954).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  In affirming the judgment of the court of first instance, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, Second Department, stated: "The proceeding was properly before the court. However, the petition does not allege facts which establish a clear legal right to the relief sought nor which establish that respondents failed to perform a duty enjoined by law." 281 App. Div. 987, 120 N. Y. S. 2d 854.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="num" id="p1"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This suit arose out of a proceeding before the National Railroad Adjustment Board. A dispute had arisen between the Order of Railroad Telegraphers (Telegraphers) and the Illinois Central Railroad Co. (Railroad) regarding the latter's employment of a member of the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employees (Clerks) in a position which Telegraphers claimed should, under its collective bargaining agreement with Railroad, be assigned to a member of Telegraphers. After attempted settlement by negotiation had failed, Telegraphers submitted the dispute, in accordance with the Railway Labor Act, 44 Stat. 577, as amended, 48 Stat. 926, 45 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 151 et seq., 45 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 151 et seq., to the Third Division of the National Railroad Adjustment Board. Notice of the proceeding was served by the Board on Telegraphers and Railroad. Railroad was then advised by letter that Clerks would prosecute a claim in the event that the rights of Clerks under their agreement with Railroad were adversely affected by the disposition of Telegraphers' claim. Railroad filed a 'submission' with the Board asserting that the disputed position involved clerical work of the type customarily performed by clerical forces in the industry and was in fact occupied by a member of Clerks, one Shears. Accordingly, Railroad contended, Telegraphers' claim should be denied, but in any event notice and opportunity to be heard should be afforded Clerks and Shears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p2"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The ten members of the Board, five representing labor and five representing the carriers, deadlocked on the merits and a Referee was appointed as a member of the Board, agreeably to &amp;#167; 3, First (l) of the Railway Labor Act. When Telegraphers' claim came on for hearing on May 13, 1953, a carrier member of the Board objected that no notice had been served on Clerks pursuant to the requirement of &amp;#167; 3 First (j) of the Act:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p3"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Parties may be heard either in person, by counsel, or by      other representatives, as they may respectively elect, and      the several divisions of the Adjustment Board shall give due      notice of all hearings to the employee or employees and the      carrier or carriers involved in any disputes submitted to      them.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p4"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This objection was considered in camera by the regular members of the Board, the Referee having been excluded, as the District Court found, 'in accordance with the custom and practice of the Third Division.' An even division resulted and the objection did not carry. After the Board reconvened in public, and in the presence of the Referee, who was not requested to and did not vote on this issue, the carrier member recited that the motion had lost and reiterated his objection, but the hearing resumed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p5"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;On May 22, apparently after the hearing had ended but prior to any announcement of a decision, Railroad filed the present action against the Board as such, its individual members, and the Referee. Railroad alleged that the failure to give notice violated the Act and that an award to Telegraphers would not prevent Clerks from prosecuting a similar claim successfully. The complaint sought temporary and permanent injunctions directing the Board to issue notice to Clerks and Shears, and restraining it from proceeding with any disposition of the claim until such notice had been given. Telegraphers, on intervention, contended, inter alia, that the means of review prescribed by the Railway Labor Act was exclusive and deprived the District Court of jurisdiction, that Railroad had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies, that Railroad showed no injury, and that, in any event, under the Act the Board was not required to notify Shears and Clerks. The Board moved to dismiss on the ground that the action was premature, that other adequate administrative and judicial remedies existed and that Railroad was not threatened with irreparable injury.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p6"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The District Court held that Shears and Clerks were 'employees involved' within &amp;#167; 3, First (j), that it was the 'custom and practice' of the Third Division of the Board to deny notice and right to be heard to others than the parties to the specific claim before the Board, and that failure to do so was a denial of due process to the other interested persons and deprived the Board of jurisdiction. It issued a preliminary injunction restraining the Board from proceeding further in the matter unless formal notice was given to Shears and Clerks. On appeal by Telegraphers and the labor members of the Board, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that there could be 'hardly any doubt' that Clerks and Shears were 'involved' and that any award rendered without notice to them would be void and unenforceable. It rejected the contention that this action was premature because the award might be in favor of Railroad or the proceeding might be dismissed upon the deciding vote of the Referee based on failure to give notice. The court found that the Board had already refused to give notice and held that the Referee had no authority to cast a vote on a 'procedural' matter. Since no administrative channel was found available for review of the failure to give notice, the court held that there was no need to await the conclusion of proceedings before the Board. Irreparable injury was found in the fact that Railroad would be required to devote time and money to what it deemed an invalid proceeding and was faced with the threat of a conflicting proceeding by Clerks. Emphasizing that this judicial proceeding did not constitute review of an award, but was 'in the nature of mandamus' to compel the Board to perform its duty, the Court of Appeals affirmed, one judge dissenting. &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca7/2cvs/illinois-cent-r-co-v-whitehouse/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;212&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 30. We granted certiorari because serious questions concerning the administration of the Railway Labor Act are in issue. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;348&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;809&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 75 S.Ct. 36.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p7"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;We have been urged to resolve the present dispute regarding the requirement of notice to persons not formal parties to a submission to the Board, a dispute which has resulted in numerous conflicting decisions by the Board.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; This remains a perplexing problem despite the substantial agreement among Courts of Appeals which have considered the question in holding that notice is required to other persons in varying situations.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; The wording of the notice provision of &amp;#167; 3 First (j) does not give a clear answer. In the context of other related provisions it is certainly not obvious that in a situation like that now before us notice need be given beyond the parties to the submission. See &amp;#167; 3, First (i), (l), (m). Analogy to the law of parties as developed for judicial proceedings is not compelling and in any event does not approach constitutional magnitude. Both its history and the interests it governs show the Railway Labor Act to be unique. 'The railroad world is like a state within a state. Its population of some three million, if we include the families of workers, has its own customs and its own vocabulary, and lives according to rules of its own making.' Garrison, The National Railroad Adjustment Board: A Unique Administrative Agency, 46 Yale L.J. 567, 568&amp;#8212;569.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p8"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;We have also been urged to reverse the holding of the lower court that a Referee may neither be appointed to resolve a deadlock on the question of notice nor, having been appointed to break a deadlock on the merits, vote to dismiss the proceeding because of failure to give the required notice. Again, we have been asked to judge Railroad's present claim to relief on the basis of irreparable injuries which are alleged to flow from the dilemma in which Railroad will find itself if confronted either by an invalid award or a situation in which no valid award may be obtained. Railroad asserts that this dilemma is inevitable and will entail continuing industrial friction, the possibility of conflicting awards to both unions, and accumulating claims to back pay or damages which might have been avoided had notice been given and a valid award been rendered. If the award is against it, Railroad claims that it is at a loss to know whether to comply and be subjected both to suits to enjoin compliance and further Board proceedings by the third party, or to refuse to comply and attempt to defend an enforcement proceeding brought under &amp;#167; 3, First (p).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;At the lowest it is doubtful whether these hypothetical injuries are fairly to be deemed irreparable and without other adequate administrative or judicial remedy. Assuming that the Act permits the Board to consider the claim of one union in the light of competing agreements between Railroad and other unions, see Order of Railway Conductors v. Pitney, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wYV/railway-conductors-v-pitney/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;326&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;561&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 66 S.Ct. 322, 90 L.Ed. 318, does it permit 'final and binding' awards to be rendered interpreting both contracts and resolving the independent claims of both unions in a single proceeding? See &amp;#167; 3, First (m). What, beyond proceedings under the Act, may third parties do to challenge an award in which they were improperly not permitted to participate? Compare Elgin, Joliet &amp;amp; Eastern R. Co. v. Burley, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;325&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;711&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 65 S.Ct. 1282, 89 L.Ed. 1886, with General Committee v. Missouri-K.-T.R. Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wTd/general-committee-v-m-k-tr-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;320&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;323&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 64 S.Ct. 146, 88 L.Ed. 76. To what extent may defects in an award be cured in an enforcement action under &amp;#167; 3, First (p), and are the detriments which are asserted to flow from refusal to comply and reliance upon an enforcement action sufficient to justify judicial intervention? Cf. Federal Trade Commission v. Claire Furnace Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/w3B/fed-trade-comm-v-claire-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;274&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;160&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 47 S.Ct. 553, 71 L.Ed. 978. One thing is unquestioned. Were notice given to Clerks they could be indifferent to it; they would be within their legal rights to refuse to participate in the present proceeding. Clerks here have not attempted to intervene. They have merely stated an intention to bring a separate proceeding in case they are affected by an award in this case. Indeed the Railroad refers to an understanding between Clerks and Telegraphers whereby the one will not intervene in proceedings initiated before the Board by the other, but will press its claims independently. And Clerks have joined in a brief of amicus curiae which asserts that third parties are not entitled to notice. We would thus have to consider whether those potential injuries alleged to flow solely from failure of Clerks to participate may be the basis for judicial intervention where there is neither a legal right of the complaining party to be free from such injuries nor any assurance that judicial action will afford relief.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p10"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;These are perplexing questions. Their difficulty admonishes us to observe the wise limitations on our function and to confine ourselves to deciding only what is necessary to the disposition of the immediate case. Here relief is sought prior to any decision on the merits by the Board. Apart from some lower court's dicta, there is no reason for holding, in the abstract, that any possible award would be rendered void by failure to give notice to an outsider even if related interest that cannot be compulsorily joined as a party to the proceeding. The Board has jurisdiction over the only necessary parties to the proceeding and over the subject matter. If failure to give notice be treated as an error, in an award in favor of Railroad it would constitute at best harmless error which could not be made the basis of challenge by Railroad, Telegraphers or Clerks. Railroad's resort to the courts has preceded any award, and one may be rendered which could occasion no possible injury to it. The inevitable result is to disrupt the proceedings of the Board. Its decision has already been delayed for more than two years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p11"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It may be true, as the Court of Appeals observed, that this action must be viewed as 'in the nature of mandamus' because mere injunctive relief would not prevent most of the injuries which Railroad seeks to avoid. But mandamus is itself governed by equitable considerations and is to be granted only in the exercise of sound discretion. We hold, in conformity with past decisions, that the injuries are too speculative to warrant resort to extraordinary remedies. See Eccles v. People's Bank, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x5b/eccles-v-peoples-bank-of-lakewood-village/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;333&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;426&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 88 S.Ct. 641, 92 L.Ed. 784; Public Service Comm. v. Wycoff Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xen/public-serv-commn-of-utah-v-wycoff-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;344&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;237&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 73 S.Ct. 236, 97 L.Ed. 291; United States ex rel. Chicago G.W.R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wqY/united-states-ex-rel-chicago-great-western-r-co-v-/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;294&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 55 S.Ct. 326, 79 L.Ed. 752. Moreover, among the injuries asserted by Railroad, only the possibility that it is being put to needless expense incident to the pending Board proceeding will necessarily be involved if judicial relief is denied at this stage of the administrative process. Such expense is inadequate basis for intervention whether by mandamus or injunction. Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wB3/myers-v-bethlehem-shipbuilding-corp/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;303&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;41&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 58 S.Ct. 459, 82 L.Ed. 638; Utah Fuel Co. v.

&lt;center&gt;Argued April 18, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided June 6, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF GEORGIA.
&lt;p&gt;By invitation of the Court, 348 U. S. 957, &lt;i&gt;Eugene Gressman&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief, as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae,&lt;/i&gt; in support of petitioner. &lt;i&gt;Carter Goode&lt;/i&gt; submitted on brief for petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*376&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;E. Freeman Leverett&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Robert H. Hall,&lt;/i&gt; Assistant Attorneys General of Georgia, argued the cause for respondent. With them on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Eugene Cook,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court has here under review the decision of a state court rejecting a claim of infirmity in a conviction for murder based on a constitutional ground raised for the first time in an extraordinary proceeding after the conviction had been affirmed on appeal. Respect for the State's administration of criminal justice requires a detailed narrative of the procedural course of this litigation and an adequate consideration of the legal factors relevant to our disposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner, a Negro, was convicted in Fulton County, Georgia, of the murder of a white man and sentenced to death. According to the allegations before us, the petit jury which convicted him was selected in the following manner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 18, 1953, a judge of the Fulton County Superior Court selected from a box the names of prospective jurors. The names of white persons were on white tickets and the names of Negroes were on yellow tickets. The tickets were handed to a deputy sheriff, who in turn gave them to a deputy clerk for listing. The named jurors were subsequently summoned, some were excused, and the remaining 120 were available for the ten panels of twelve jurors each to serve in the trial of civil and criminal cases in the Fulton County Superior Court for the week of March 9, 1953. Of the 120 jurors, four were Negroes, and all four were assigned to the criminal docket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 10, 1953, a panel of 48 of the 120 jurors was "put upon" Williams at his trial. Thirteen jurors, including &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*377&lt;/span&gt; three of the four Negroes, were excused for cause. The State peremptorily challenged the fourth Negro, so that no Negroes served on the jury of twelve which was finally selected to try Williams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial, which immediately followed the selection of the jury, lasted one day. Twenty-three witnesses appeared against Williams. His only defense was a short unsworn statement to the effect that he had not committed the crime and that he had been "afraid" when he signed the written confession introduced against him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams' court-appointed attorney filed a formal motion for new trial on March 27, 1953, and a more detailed amendment to the motion on June 29, 1953. The motion was overruled, and an appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court followed. On October 14, 1953, that court affirmed the judgment. &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ga/7Lgj/williams-v-state/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;210&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;207&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 78 S. E. 2d 521.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 1, 1953, Williams' counsel filed in the trial court an extraordinary motion for new trial under Ga. Code Ann., &#167; 70-303.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; In this motion he alleged for the first time that Williams had been denied equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by the manner in which the petit jury had been selected, organized, impaneled and challenged. An affidavit by Williams accompanied the motion, stating that at the time of trial he had no knowledge of the methods used to select the jury. A similar affidavit by his counsel stated further that "the same &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*378&lt;/span&gt; could not have been discovered by him [the counsel] in the exercise of ordinary diligence." The law partner of Williams' counsel submitted a third affidavit to the effect that he had taken no part in the trial or in its preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 18, 1954, the trial court dismissed the extraordinary motion for new trial. An appeal was taken to the Georgia Supreme Court. In the appeal, reliance was placed almost exclusively upon the case of &lt;i&gt;Avery&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 559, for the claim that Williams had been denied equal protection of the laws. The pertinence of that case to this turns on the time sequence in the two cases&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; as well as on the relevant substantive facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avery was convicted of rape on September 20, 1951, in Fulton County, Georgia&#151;the same county in which Williams was tried a year and a half later. Avery's petit jury was drawn with yellow and white tickets, precisely in the manner used later in the case of Williams. In Avery's case, no Negroes appeared on the list of 60 jurors put upon him at the trial, whereas here, four Negroes appeared on the list of 120 jurors from which Williams' jury was selected. Avery, however, challenged the array when the jury was put upon him; Williams did not. Avery's challenge was overruled, and after trial he appealed on the ground of discrimination in the selection of the jury. The Georgia Supreme Court disapproved of the use of yellow and white tickets but affirmed the judgment on the ground that no discrimination was actually shown.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*379&lt;/span&gt; Certiorari in the &lt;i&gt;Avery&lt;/i&gt; case was filed in this Court on July 28, 1952, nine weeks before the alleged murder in the &lt;i&gt;Williams&lt;/i&gt; case. The ground, as here, was that the use of different-colored tickets for whites and Negroes deprived the defendant of equal protection of the laws. Avery's petition for certiorari was granted March 9, 1953, the day before the petit jury was put upon Williams. This Court reversed the &lt;i&gt;Avery&lt;/i&gt; case on May 25, 1953, holding that Avery had made out a prima facie case of an unconstitutional discrimination by showing the use of different-colored tickets which the State had not rebutted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this Court's decision in the &lt;i&gt;Avery&lt;/i&gt; case was thus rendered over two months after Williams' trial, it came a month before the amendment to his formal motion for new trial. Yet Williams' counsel did not rely upon the ground raised by the &lt;i&gt;Avery&lt;/i&gt; decision until some six months later in his extraordinary motion for new trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As already stated, the extraordinary motion was dismissed by the trial court, and Williams again appealed to the Georgia Supreme Court. That court affirmed the dismissal of the extraordinary motion. The court concluded that Williams, having failed to challenge the array when put upon him, had waived any objections to the jury's selection. The affidavits of Williams, his counsel, and his counsel's partner were deemed insufficient to excuse Williams' failure to challenge the array at the outset of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court did not rest on this consideration. It urged that the facts inherent in the case contradicted the affidavits. The court said that its own decision in the &lt;i&gt;Avery&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*380&lt;/span&gt; case, prior to the Williams trial, had fully set out the practice of using different-colored tickets in the selection of juries. "Due diligence would certainly have required the defendant and his attorney to make themselves familiar with the opinions of this court on the question now raised. It follows that, for this reason, the motion for new trial was not sufficient as an extraordinary motion for new trial." &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ga/7sgi/williams-v-state/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;210&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;665&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 668, 82 S. E. 2d 217, 219.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In view of the entanglement of this case with our decision in &lt;i&gt;Avery,&lt;/i&gt; we granted certiorari. 348 U. S. 854. Since the attorney appointed by the Georgia court advised the Clerk of this Court that he would not be in a position to present oral argument before this Court,&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; we appointed &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*381&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; to present argument on Williams' behalf. 348 U. S. 957.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his brief on behalf of the State before the State Supreme Court, the Solicitor General of Fulton County had urged, &lt;i&gt;inter alia,&lt;/i&gt; that there was no showing of a denial of equal protection in this case.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; On oral argument &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*382&lt;/span&gt; here, however, the State, with commendable regard for its responsibility, agreed that the use of yellow and white tickets in this case was, in light of this Court's decision in &lt;i&gt;Avery,&lt;/i&gt; a denial of equal protection, so that a new trial would be required but for the failure to challenge the array. We need only add that it was the system of selection and the resulting danger of abuse which was struck down in &lt;i&gt;Avery&lt;/i&gt; and not an actual showing of discrimination on the basis of comparative numbers of Negroes and whites on the jury lists. The question now before us, in view of the State's concession, is whether the ruling of the Georgia Supreme Court rests upon an adequate nonfederal ground, so that this Court is without jurisdiction to review the Georgia court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A state procedural rule which forbids the raising of federal questions at late stages in the case, or by any &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*383&lt;/span&gt; other than a prescribed method, has been recognized as a valid exercise of state power.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; The principle is clear enough. But the unique aspects of the never-ending new cases that arise require its individual application to particular circumstances. Thus, we would have a different question from that before us if the trial court had no power to consider Williams' constitutional objection at the belated time he raised it. But, where a State allows questions of this sort to be raised at a late stage and be determined by its courts as a matter of discretion, we are not concluded from assuming jurisdiction and deciding whether the state court action in the particular circumstances is, in effect, an avoidance of the federal right.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; A state court may not, in the exercise of its discretion, decline to entertain a constitutional claim while passing upon kindred issues raised in the same manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Georgia courts have indicated many times that motions for new trial after verdict are not favored, and that extraordinary motions for new trial after final judgment are favored even less.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; But the Georgia statute provides for such motion,&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; and it has been granted in "exceptional" or "extraordinary" cases. The general rule is that the granting or denying of an extraordinary motion &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*384&lt;/span&gt; for new trial rests primarily in the discretion of the trial court, and the appellate court will not reverse except for a clear abuse of discretion.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; In practice, however, the Georgia appellate courts have not hesitated to reverse and grant a new trial in exceptional cases. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Wright&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Davis,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;184&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;846&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 193 S. E. 757 (1937), the defendant was sentenced to death, his motion for new trial was overruled, and the judgment was affirmed on appeal by the Georgia Supreme Court. Three months after the affirmance the defendant made an extraordinary motion for new trial on the ground that an ex-convict had obtained a seat on the jury by impersonating his father, whose name was properly on the jury list. The trial court denied the extraordinary motion. The Georgia Supreme Court granted mandamus and made it absolute. It said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the instant case we are of the opinion that the extraordinary motion for a new trial and the proffered amendment presented a state of facts which, standing without dispute, required as a matter of law that a new trial should be granted. . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;". . . The verdict itself shows that the defendant was not benefited, as he received the extreme penalty, and it is clear that he was deprived of his right to have a jury composed entirely of upright men. Code, &#167;&#167; 2-4502, 59-106. It will not do to speculate on whether the accused suffered actual injury, when so vital a right has been violated. There are some conditions from which injury will be presumed. . . ." (184 Ga., at 851, 853, 193 S. E., at 760.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*385&lt;/span&gt; The court rejected the State's contention that the defendant had not shown due diligence in discovering the juror's disqualification.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Smith&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga. App.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;574&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 59 S. E. 311 (1907), involved a conviction for arson. A motion for new trial was denied, the judgment was affirmed on appeal, and five months later the defendant filed an extraordinary motion for new trial on the ground that one of the jurors was related to the deceased wife of the prosecutor within the ninth degree, and several of the prosecutor's children continued the kinship by affinity. The trial court denied the motion, but the appellate court granted a new trial. It said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;". . . There is no higher purpose to be subserved in the administration of the criminal law than that every defendant shall be accorded a trial by jury, and jury trial is a mockery unless the jury be not only impartial but also beyond just suspicion of partiality. . . ." (2 Ga. App., at 578, 59 S. E., at 313.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In answer to the State's contention that the defendant and his attorney had not shown due diligence in discovering the prohibited relationship, the court said that the trial judge had inquired into the question of relationship when the jury was impaneled, and then the court added this quotation from a Georgia Supreme Court opinion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;". . . `Parties are not required to make searching investigation out of court to determine whether the jurors who are summoned are disqualified in their cases. Not only is such a duty not placed by the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*386&lt;/span&gt; law upon parties and their counsel, but the contrary practice is to be encouraged, for obvious reasons.' " (2 Ga. App., at 582, 59 S. E., at 315.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Crawley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;151&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;818&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 108 S. E. 238 (1921), four defendants were convicted of murder. Two were sentenced to death and two to life imprisonment. A motion for new trial was overruled, the judgment was affirmed on appeal, a motion for rehearing was denied, and a week later the defendants filed an extraordinary motion for new trial, which the trial court overruled. The Georgia Supreme Court reversed. The extraordinary motion showed that the wife of one juror was within the ninth degree of relationship to the wife of the murdered man. A new trial was granted even though the State submitted an affidavit by the juror that he did not know of the relationship at the time of the trial and therefore could not have been prejudiced.&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Doyal&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;73&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;72&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1884), the defendant was convicted of murder. His motion for new trial was denied, and the judgment was affirmed on appeal. He filed an extraordinary motion for new trial on the ground that five witnesses were ready to testify that one of the jurors had said in effect before the trial that the defendant ought to be hung and that the juror would see to it if he got on the jury. The defendant and his attorney filed affidavits to the effect that they had been ignorant of the facts at the time of trial. Despite affidavits submitted &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*387&lt;/span&gt; by the State showing the availability of three of the five witnesses at the time of trial, the Georgia Supreme Court granted a new trial.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other cases of like tenor.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these cases (barring &lt;i&gt;Harris&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; n. 14) involved objections to individual jurors, as contrasted with the objection to the whole panel in this case. But the two situations cannot be distinguished on this ground. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*388&lt;/span&gt; Georgia has a rule, as the State Supreme Court noted in this case, that an objection to the whole panel must be made by way of a challenge to the array at the time the panel is put upon the defendant. &lt;i&gt;Cornelious&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;193&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 17 S. E. 2d 156 (1941); &lt;i&gt;Wilcoxon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Aldredge,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;192&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;634&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 15 S. E. 2d 873 (1941); &lt;i&gt;Cumming&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;155&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;346&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 117 S. E. 378 (1923); &lt;i&gt;Lumpkin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;152&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;229&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 109 S. E. 664 (1921).&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt; But none of these cases declare that an extraordinary motion is not available &lt;i&gt;in a proper case&lt;/i&gt; for granting a new trial when the objection is to the panel. On the contrary, several factors indicate that the trial judge and the appellate court have the same degree of discretion in the "array" cases as in cases involving individual jurors. &lt;i&gt;First:&lt;/i&gt; There is also a rule in Georgia that an objection to an individual juror must be made at the trial by a challenge to the poll.&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*389&lt;/span&gt; But as the cases above demonstrate, this rule gives way in an exceptional case to the need for a new trial shown by extraordinary motion. It does not appear rational to deny that the rule as to challenges to the array is likewise not inflexible. &lt;i&gt;Second:&lt;/i&gt; The opinion of the Georgia Supreme Court in this case supports this conclusion. If the trial court had no power to entertain the motion, it was immaterial whether the affidavits were faulty. Yet the Supreme Court felt called upon to question the reliability of the affidavits, concluding that Williams' counsel must have failed to use due diligence and "for this reason" the motion was "not sufficient."&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that the trial court and the State Supreme Court declined to grant Williams' motion though possessed of power to do so under state law. Since his motion was based upon a constitutional objection, and one the validity of which has in principle been sustained here, the discretionary decision to deny the motion does not deprive this Court of jurisdiction to find that the substantive issue is properly before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the fact that we have jurisdiction does not compel us to exercise it. In &lt;i&gt;Patterson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Alabama,&lt;/i&gt; 294 U. S. 600, we remanded a case to the highest court of the State, even though that court had affirmed on state procedural grounds, because after that affirmance we had reversed on constitutional grounds a case having identical substantive facts. We said there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"While we must have proper regard to this ruling of the state court in relation to its appellate procedure, we cannot ignore the exceptional features of the present case. An important question under the Federal Constitution was involved, and, from that standpoint, the case did not stand alone. . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*390&lt;/span&gt; ". . . We are not satisfied that the court would have dealt with the case in the same way if it had determined the constitutional question as we have determined it. . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We have frequently held that in the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction we have power not only to correct error in the judgment under review but to make such disposition of the case as justice requires. And in determining what justice does require, the Court is bound to consider any change, either in fact or in law, which has supervened since the judgment was entered. We may recognize such a change, which may affect the result, by setting aside the judgment and remanding the case so that the state court may be free to act. We have said that to do this is not to review, in any proper sense of the term, the decision of the state court upon a non-federal question, but only to deal appropriately with a matter arising since its judgment and having a bearing upon the right disposition of the case. . . ." (294 U. S., at 605, 606, 607.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the instant case, there is an important factor which has intervened since the affirmance by the Georgia Supreme Court which impels us to remand for that court's further consideration. This is the acknowledgment by the State before this Court that, as a matter of substantive law, Williams has been deprived of his constitutional rights. The Solicitor General of Fulton County, it should be recalled, had urged before the Georgia Supreme Court that no denial of equal protection was involved, and that court may well have been influenced by the contention. Moreover, if there is another remedy open to Williams, as the Attorney General of the State intimated in his brief to the Georgia Supreme Court, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*391&lt;/span&gt; that court should have an opportunity to designate the appropriate remedy.&lt;sup&gt;[18]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facts of this case are extraordinary, particularly in view of the use of yellow and white tickets by a judge of the Fulton County Superior Court almost a year after the State's own Supreme Court had condemned the practice in the &lt;i&gt;Avery&lt;/i&gt; case. That life is at stake is of course another important factor in creating the extraordinary situation. The difference between capital and non-capital offenses is the basis of differentiation in law in diverse ways in which the distinction becomes relevant.&lt;sup&gt;[19]&lt;/sup&gt; We think that orderly procedure requires a remand to the State Supreme Court for reconsideration of the case. Fair regard for the principles which the Georgia courts have enforced in numerous cases and for the constitutional commands binding on all courts compels us to reject the assumption that the courts of Georgia would allow this man to go to his death as the result of a conviction secured from a jury which the State admits was unconstitutionally impaneled. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Mooney&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Holohan,&lt;/i&gt; 294 U. S. 103.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Remanded.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 25, 1953&#151;this Court reverses, holding jury selection unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*393&lt;/span&gt; MR. JUSTICE CLARK, with whom MR. JUSTICE REED and MR. JUSTICE MINTON join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To borrow a phrase from Mr. Justice Holmes, the opinion of the Court "just won't wash." While I, too, am not deaf to the pleas of the condemned, I cannot ignore the long-established precedents of this Court. The proper course, as has always been followed here, is to recognize and honor reasonable state procedures as valid exercises of sovereign power. We have done so in hundreds of capital cases since I have been on the Court, and I do not think that even the sympathetic facts of this case should make us lose sight of the limitations on this Court's powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see just how far the Court has "stretched" here, it is only necessary to compare today's majority opinion with &lt;i&gt;Patterson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Alabama,&lt;/i&gt; 294 U. S. 600, the decision relied on to support the Court's remand. In that case, Patterson and one Norris had been charged in a common indictment. Prior to trial, both interposed constitutional claims of systematic exclusion of Negroes from the jury. Patterson, however, failed to file his bill of exceptions within the time prescribed by state law. The Alabama Supreme Court decided the separate appeals on the same day, denying Norris' claim on the merits, &lt;i&gt;Norris&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;229&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ala.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;226&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;156&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;So.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;556&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, while dismissing Patterson's case as out of time. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;229&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ala.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;270&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 156 So. 567. This Court thereafter reversed Norris' conviction. 294 U. S. 587. In &lt;i&gt;Patterson,&lt;/i&gt; however, the Court was confronted with an independent and adequate state ground which presented an insuperable obstacle to reversal. Nevertheless, it was quite possible that had the Alabama court realized the validity of the objection it had overruled on the merits in &lt;i&gt;Norris,&lt;/i&gt; it might have regarded the whole complexion of the case as different and chosen not to rest on a narrow procedural ground in &lt;i&gt;Patterson.&lt;/i&gt; This Court, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*394&lt;/span&gt; therefore, remanded the case to the Alabama Supreme Court for reconsideration of its decision in the light of the important intervening factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the magnitude of the "important intervening factor" here and just how it changes the complexion of the case. The majority relies on the fact that the State "[o]n oral argument here . . . agreed that the use of yellow and white tickets in this case was, in light of this Court's decision in &lt;i&gt;Avery,&lt;/i&gt; a denial of equal protection, so that a new trial would be required but for the failure to challenge the array." The Solicitor General of Fulton County, the Court reasons, "had urged [by brief] before the Georgia Supreme Court that no denial of equal protection was involved, and that court may well have been influenced by the contention."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Solicitor General of Fulton County presented no oral argument here. Only the State Attorney General, whose sole contention before the Georgia court was that the "question [was] not ground for extraordinary motion for new trial," was represented before this Court. The majority's "important intervening factor," therefore, is that an Assistant Attorney General of Georgia has now expressed an opinion on a question his superior did not reach in his brief before the Georgia Supreme Court. Since good advocacy would dictate that the Attorney General argue this point before the Georgia court had he thought it substantial, I do not think his office underwent any great change of mind in the interim between that argument and this. On argument, after questioning on the point&#151;which we note was not one of the questions he raised&#151;the Assistant Attorney General stated only what the Attorney General's brief below had intimated. In any event, I am completely at a loss to understand what difference it makes what was argued in the Georgia Supreme Court or conceded here, since the Georgia &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*395&lt;/span&gt; Supreme Court clearly stated that, but for the procedural objection, &lt;i&gt;Avery&lt;/i&gt; would govern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Defendant in his motion sets forth a practice which has been condemned by this court and the Supreme Court of the United States. However, any question to be considered by this court must be raised at the time and in the manner required under the rules of law and practice and procedure in effect in this State." &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ga/7sgi/williams-v-state/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;210&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;665&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 669, 82 S. E. 2d 217, 219.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority's other ground for remand is even weaker, relying on a phrase from the Attorney General's brief before the Georgia court&#151;"we do not say that he [Williams] does not have some remedy at law." The ground asserted is that in the light of this "intimat[ion]" of the Attorney General, Georgia's court "should have an opportunity to designate the appropriate remedy." If Williams has a remedy, he can certainly pursue it as well without this remand; and if he has no other state remedy, it is even clearer that nothing is to be gained by the Court's disposition of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another difference between this case and &lt;i&gt;Patterson&lt;/i&gt; is at once evident. In &lt;i&gt;Patterson,&lt;/i&gt; the Court, through Chief Justice Hughes, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We are not convinced that the court, in the presence of such a determination of constitutional right, confronting the anomalous and grave situation which would be created by a reversal of the judgment against Norris, and an affirmance of the judgment of death in the companion case of Patterson, who had asserted the same right, . . . would have considered itself powerless to entertain the bill of exceptions or otherwise to provide appropriate relief. . . . At least &lt;i&gt;the state court should have an opportunity to examine its powers&lt;/i&gt; in the light of the situation which &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*396&lt;/span&gt; has now developed. We should not foreclose that opportunity."&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; (Italics supplied.) 294 U. S., at 606-607.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, unlike &lt;i&gt;Patterson,&lt;/i&gt; the Court determines the state law itself. We have always insisted that, if possible, state courts be permitted to decide difficult and uncertain questions of state law before the federal courts do so, even to the point of having the federal courts decline jurisdiction to await the State's ruling. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Burford&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sun Oil Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 319 U. S. 315. To me nothing could be clearer than that a state question arising in a case which is to be remanded to the state court should be left open for resolution by the State without the pressure of a decision by this Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I agree with MR. JUSTICE MINTON that the majority has misconstrued Georgia's law. As I read the state law, the decisions indicate that the Georgia courts have no power to hear and determine petitioner's extraordinary motion on the merits. Ever since &lt;i&gt;Jordan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;545&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1857), the Georgia law has been that the defendant must challenge the array when the panel is "put upon" him and not thereafter. And since it is too late to raise such a challenge in a motion for new trial, &lt;i&gt;Moon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;68&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;687&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1882), certainly the objection cannot be made in an extraordinary motion coming, as here, seven months after verdict. See also &lt;i&gt;Cumming&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*397&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;155&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;346&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 117 S. E. 2d 378 (1923). In fact, as late as 1941, Georgia's highest court rejected a claim of discrimination in the selection of jurors "for the reason that an objection of this kind should have been presented in a proper way at the trial, and upon failure to do so it is to be considered waived." &lt;i&gt;Wilcoxon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Aldredge,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;192&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;634&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 637, 15 S. E. 2d 873, 876. This was a capital case, and it was conceded that the prisoner's claim had substantive validity. But even in those extreme circumstances the Georgia Supreme Court did not consider the objection available after trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Georgia Court of Appeals has consistently taken the same position. In &lt;i&gt;Ivey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga. App.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;828&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 831, 62 S. E. 565 (1908), and &lt;i&gt;Williams&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga. App.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;173&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 174, 120 S. E. 131, 132 (1923), it was held that "If he [defendant] does not challenge the array, no other method of complaint as to the deficiency of the panel is open to him."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reaching the opposite conclusion, &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; that the Georgia courts have discretionary authority to consider the petitioner's untimely objection in the circumstances of this case, the majority relies on two factors. &lt;i&gt;First,&lt;/i&gt; the Georgia court in the instant case, after holding that petitioner had waived his objection by failing to raise it at the proper time, went on to find that the proffered justification was inadequate as a matter of pleading and as a matter of fact. But it is difficult to see how this separately numbered alternative ground can impair the court's other decision that, excuse or no excuse, petitioner had waived his claim "once and for all." &lt;i&gt;Second,&lt;/i&gt; it is urged that the Georgia courts frequently exercise their discretion in favor of untimely objections directed at individual jurors&#151;"challenges to the poll" as they are called in Georgia. The majority cites no case, however, where such discretion was exercised on a challenge to the array, and not one of the majority's individual juror cases is mentioned, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*398&lt;/span&gt; much less distinguished, in the Georgia court's opinion in this case. Since courts usually distinguish apparent conflicts, it is fair to assume that the Georgia court considered the two types of challenge to be governed by entirely different rules. This conclusion is buttressed both by the distinction drawn between these types under Georgia law and by the differing considerations controlling their allowance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenges to the array are "directed to the whole group collectively for causes in the nature of irregularities in the form, manner and making up of the panel." Davis and Shulman, Georgia Practice and Procedure, p. 454. Challenges to the poll are "directed solely for objections which are inherent in the individual jurors," Georgia Practice and Procedure, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 455. Circumstances require that challenges to the array be made before trial. If permitted thereafter&#151;and upheld&#151;the judgments in many, if not all, other cases tried before juries obtained from the same panel would be subject to like attack. For example, illegality in the array summoned for March 9, 1953, from which the &lt;i&gt;Williams&lt;/i&gt; jury was selected, might result in the overturning of all verdicts returned in the county during their tenure. This would be both expensive and time-wasting, as well as disruptive of the proper administration of justice. Hence Georgia requires a challenge to be made before trial in order to give the judge an opportunity to correct the irregularity. On the other hand, a challenge to a petit juror or to the poll merely affects the one verdict of that jury of twelve rather than all the verdicts of the panel of one hundred and twenty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority dwells on the extreme circumstances of this case, discusses in great detail the Georgia cases affording discretionary relief in less strong cases involving individual jurors, and warns that "we are not concluded from assuming jurisdiction and deciding whether the state court action in the particular circumstances is, in &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*399&lt;/span&gt; effect, an avoidance of the federal right." Although I find it difficult to ascertain exactly what ground the majority could give for striking down the Georgia result, it is clear to me that no theory ever before accepted by this Court could lead to reversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is elementary that this Court has no jurisdiction over a case here from a state court where there is an independent and adequate state ground supporting the conclusion reached below.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; A purported state ground is not independent and adequate in two instances. &lt;i&gt;First,&lt;/i&gt; where the circumstances give rise to an inference that the state court is guilty of an evasion&#151;an interpretation of state law with the specific intent to deprive a litigant of a federal right.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Second,&lt;/i&gt; where the state law, honestly applied though it may be, and even dictated by the precedents, throws such obstacles in the way of enforcement of federal rights that it must be struck down as unreasonably interfering with the vindication of such rights.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is obvious that the Georgia court has not been guilty of "evasion." Although the Georgia court's interpretation of state law may not be free from doubt, it is not possible to say that the Georgia decision is without "fair support" in the previous cases.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; I regard it also as note-worthy &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*400&lt;/span&gt; that Presiding Justice Wyatt wrote this opinion for the Georgia Supreme Court. It was he who, in the Georgia court's decision in &lt;i&gt;Avery,&lt;/i&gt; said in dissent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I cannot agree with the ruling [as to discrimination] for the reason, in my opinion, that this practice is conclusive evidence of discrimination, and for that reason the case should be reversed." &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ga/7LbX/avery-v-state/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;209&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;116&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 131, 70 S. E. 2d 716, 726.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this ruling he went further in protecting the integrity of the jury system than we ourselves thought necessary. Compare &lt;i&gt;Avery&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 559, 562-563 (petitioner established "a prima facie case of discrimination" which the State failed to rebut). One who had so acted would hardly be attempting to evade the very federal right he had previously upheld so strongly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*401&lt;/span&gt; Similarly, the Georgia procedure is not unduly burdensome. The majority concedes that "[a] state procedural rule which forbids the raising of federal questions at late stages in the case, or by any other than a prescribed method, has been recognized as a valid exercise of state power." Even if the majority could somehow strike down the Georgia court's holding that it lacked discretion, it is not enough to show that Georgia has the power and refuses to exercise it. There is no case to support the implication that the exercise of discretion against a federal right is, without more, an evasion. See &lt;i&gt;Brown&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Allen,&lt;/i&gt; 344 U. S. 443, 484-486. Indeed, it would seem that there would have to be a withholding of discretion for the &lt;i&gt;purpose&lt;/i&gt; of depriving Williams of a federal right. There is nothing even approaching that here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A state court's decision cannot be overturned if any one of the grounds supporting it is independent and adequate. There is one ground here which appears so unassailable that the majority does not even attack it. Georgia law makes a showing of due diligence on the part of the movant a prerequisite to granting extraordinary motions for new trial. The state court in this case found that due diligence had not been properly pleaded, and that the facts of which the Georgia court could take notice conclusively demonstrated that diligence was indeed completely lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first ground, there is clearly substantial support in the prior state decisions. Petitioner's attorney stated that "he did not know of the facts [establishing the constitutional claim] before the trial and before the verdict in said case, and that the same could not have been discovered by him in the exercise of ordinary diligence." It had been held in at least four prior Georgia decisions that such conclusory pleading of diligence was inadequate to support a motion for a new trial or an extraordinary action for the same. &lt;i&gt;Taylor&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/oklacivapp/6QB2/taylor-v-state/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;132&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;235&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 63 S. E. 1116; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*402&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;King&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/oklacivapp/6KpV/king-v-state/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;174&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;432&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 163 S. E. 168; &lt;i&gt;Redding&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/texcrimapp/dreo/redding-v-state/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;183&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;704&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 189 S. E. 514; &lt;i&gt;Edge&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;257&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 36 S. E. 2d 673.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the second ground, the Georgia opinion speaks for itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Furthermore, the facts and circumstances contradict the statements made in the affidavits. When the instant case came on for trial in Fulton Superior Court on March 10, 1953, the case of &lt;i&gt;Avery&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State&lt;/i&gt; had been tried in the same county, and that case had been affirmed by this court on April 14, 1952, and was pending in the United States Supreme Court. . . . The opinion of this court affirming the lower court in the &lt;i&gt;Avery&lt;/i&gt; case sets out fully the methods and practices employed in the selection and empaneling of juries in Fulton County, including the practice of putting the names of white jurors on white slips of paper and the names of colored jurors on yellow slips of paper. Due diligence would certainly have required the defendant and his attorney to make themselves familiar with the opinions of this court on the question now raised."&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ga/7sgi/williams-v-state/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;210&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;665&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 668, 82 S. E. 2d 217, 219.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*403&lt;/span&gt; It is evident on this record that, even if the Georgia court is deemed to have discretion in this matter, it could adhere to its present decision and not be reversed in this Court without a major departure from our doctrines requiring respect for state procedural rules affording a "reasonable opportunity" to present federal questions. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Parker&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Illinois,&lt;/i&gt; 333 U. S. 571.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had the state court possessed the power, it might have been desirable to have permitted petitioner to adjudicate his substantial constitutional claim instead of sending him to his death because his attorney failed to take advantage of the usual opportunity afforded by the state law. On the other hand, had the jury acquitted petitioner, he would not have complained about any unconstitutionality in its selection. A State may be influenced by the unfairness of allowing the litigant who remains silent two chances for acquittal while giving the diligent litigant only one. And orderly administration of the laws often imposes hardships upon those who have not properly preserved their rights. In any event, the resolution of these conflicting interests should be a matter wholly for the Georgia courts. See &lt;i&gt;Herndon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; 295 U. S. 441.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE MINTON, with whom MR. JUSTICE REED and MR. JUSTICE CLARK join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georgia has a rule of law that the jury panel must be challenged at the threshold, that is, as Georgia expresses it, before the panel is "put upon the defendant." If the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*404&lt;/span&gt; panel is not thus challenged, the issue cannot later be raised and is considered as waived "once and for all." &lt;i&gt;Williams&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ga/7sgi/williams-v-state/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;210&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;665&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 669, 82 S. E. 2d 217, 220. Ga. Code Ann., &#167; 59-803. See &lt;i&gt;Jordan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;545&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a reasonable rule. It gives the State an opportunity to meet the challenge and to justify the array, or, if it is improperly constituted, an opportunity to correct it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the instant case, the challenge to the array was not presented at the time the panel was put upon the petitioner-defendant. If the defendant thus fails to challenge the array before it is put upon him, he may not raise the question as to its legality for the first time in a motion for a new trial. &lt;i&gt;Lumpkin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;152&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;229&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 231, 109 S. E. 664, 665. Such a requirement complies with the Federal Constitution. &lt;i&gt;Brown&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Allen,&lt;/i&gt; 344 U. S. 443, 480.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since petitioner did not and could not raise the question on a motion for new trial for the first time, it would seem that he could not raise it on an extraordinary motion for a new trial. The trial court dismissed the motion, and the State Supreme Court affirmed. First, the court held that the petitioner could not challenge the array for the first time by motion for a new trial or extraordinary motion for a new trial. The Georgia Supreme Court on that said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is settled law in this State that, when a panel of jurors is put upon the prisoner, he should challenge the array for any cause which would go to show that it was not fairly and properly put upon him, and that if he fails to do so, the objection is waived and can not thereafter be made a ground of a motion for new trial. See &lt;i&gt;Lumpkin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; 152 &lt;i&gt;Ga.&lt;/i&gt; 229 (109 S. E. 664); &lt;i&gt;Cornelious&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; 193 &lt;i&gt;Ga.&lt;/i&gt; 25 (17 S. E. 2d 156); &lt;i&gt;Cumming&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; 155 &lt;i&gt;Ga.&lt;/i&gt; 346 (117 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*405&lt;/span&gt; S. E. 378); &lt;i&gt;Moon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; 68 &lt;i&gt;Ga.&lt;/i&gt; 687; and &lt;i&gt;Williams&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; 31 &lt;i&gt;Ga. App.&lt;/i&gt; 173 (120 S. E. 131). In the instant case, the defendant made no objection to the jury when the panel was put upon him, and made no objection until he filed this extraordinary motion for new trial after a new trial had been denied and that judgment affirmed by this court. See &lt;i&gt;Williams&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; ante. It follows, therefore, that the judgment of the court below dismissing the extraordinary motion for new trial was not error.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The defendant and his attorney state that they did not know of the facts set out in grounds one and two of the motion for new trial, and `that the same could not have been discovered by him in the exercise of ordinary diligence.' This is not sufficient to excuse the defendant from the necessity of presenting his written challenge to the array of traverse jurors when the panel was put upon him. See, in this connection, &lt;i&gt;Lumpkin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; supra; &lt;i&gt;Cornelious&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; supra; &lt;i&gt;Redding&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; 183 &lt;i&gt;Ga.&lt;/i&gt; 704 (189 S. E. 514); &lt;i&gt;Edge&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; 200 &lt;i&gt;Ga.&lt;/i&gt; 257 (36 S. E. 2d 673). It follows, under the decisions of this court above cited, it was not error to dismiss the extraordinary motion for new trial." &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ga/7sgi/williams-v-state/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;210&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;665&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 667-668, 82 S. E. 2d 217, 218-219.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding this matter of state law, the Supreme Court of Georgia further held that the extraordinary motion was insufficient. The defendant, in his affidavit supporting the motion, deposed: " `The defendant did not at the time of his trial . . . have any information concerning the selection, drawing, organizing, and impaneling of the jury panel put upon him on his trial, but assumed that the jury was a legal jury.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 668, 82 S. E. 2d, at 219. Also defendant's attorney deposed in his supporting affidavit that he " `did not know of the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*406&lt;/span&gt; facts set out in the first and second grounds of the extraordinary motion for new trial . . . before the trial and before the verdict in said case, and that the same could not have been discovered by him in the exercise of ordinary diligence.' " &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such allegations, the court held, were "merely opinion, without sufficient facts being shown by which the court could judge whether due diligence had been exercised, and are not sufficient to support an extraordinary motion for new trial. &lt;i&gt;Edge&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; supra; &lt;i&gt;Redding&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; supra." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the Georgia Supreme Court held, first, that the challenge to the array must be made when the array is put upon the defendant and cannot be made later by motion for a new trial or extraordinary motion for new trial; and, second, that the grounds for the latter motion were insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first holding is a well-established rule of law of Georgia and does not seem to have been applied discriminatorily so as to deny petitioner the equal protection of the law. He had the same right and opportunity to raise the question as anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promulgation of such a rule of law is, as we have pointed out, fair and reasonable and cannot be said to deny due process of law. Georgia has provided a reasonable time and manner in which the question could be raised. Petitioner did not take advantage of it, probably because, as his attorney alleged in his affidavit, he "devoted his time and efforts to ascertaining the nature of the evidence to be presented by the State of Georgia upon the trial."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Court cites a number of Georgia cases in which extraordinary motions were granted by the Georgia Supreme Court where an individual juror without knowledge of the facts was permitted to sit even though disqualified. But, in each of these cases, proper motions &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*407&lt;/span&gt; in due form and sufficient were presented and the question raised at the first opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Court now says that the Georgia Supreme Court has the power to grant the petitioner's motion. I suppose that it has, but I would not think that it had denied a federal constitutional right if it did not change its rule. In fact, I think it would lead to absurd results if it changed its rule that the challenge to the array must be made at the threshold. The defendant, knowing of an error in the constitution of the array, could lay low and always have a built-in error on which he could rely if he did not like the results at the trial. Georgia is not bound to change its rule on penalty of a violation of the Federal Constitution. &lt;i&gt;Avery&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 559, does not decide this case because in that proceeding the challenge was timely made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not sit as a legal critic to indicate how we think courts should act. If a federal constitutional right is not presented, we have no duty to perform. There was no denial of equal protection of the law or of due process. This case was disposed of by the Georgia Supreme Court altogether on state grounds. In such circumstances our duty is clear. As we stated in &lt;i&gt;Edelman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;California,&lt;/i&gt; 344 U. S. 357, 358-359:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is clear that this Court is without power to decide whether constitutional rights have been violated when the federal questions are not seasonably raised in accordance with the requirements of state law. &lt;i&gt;Hulbert&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;City of Chicago,&lt;/i&gt; 202 U. S. 275 (1906); &lt;i&gt;Mutual Life Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McGrew,&lt;/i&gt; 188 U. S. 291, 308 (1903). Noncompliance with such local law can thus be an adequate state ground for a decision below. . . ."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  "In case of a motion for a new trial made after the adjournment of the court, some good reason must be shown why the motion was not made during the term, which shall be judged of by the court. In all such cases, 20 days' notice shall be given to the opposite party. Whenever a motion for a new trial shall have been made at the term of trial in any criminal case and overruled, or when a motion for a new trial has not been made at such term, no motion for a new trial from the same verdict shall be made or received, unless the same is an extraordinary motion or case, and but one such extraordinary motion shall be made or allowed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  See Appendix, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 392, for table comparing the dates in the two cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  The court said: "And while the statute does not say so, its manifest intention is that the tickets shall be of uniform size and color, so as to make discrimination impossible in the drawing of jurors; and, where not so done, this is prima facie evidence of discrimination, and, if nothing else appeared, would require a reversal. In this case, however, it is not charged or contended that any discrimination was practiced in drawing the challenged jurors; and the judge who drew them, as a witness for the accused, testified there was in fact none. Therefore, the practice of placing the names of white and colored jurors in the jury box on tickets of different colors did no harm in this instance, and consequently furnished no sufficient objection to the jurors challenged by the accused." &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ga/7LbX/avery-v-state/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;209&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;116&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 124, 70 S. E. 2d 716, 722.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Counsel were informed that this case would be argued in this Court on March 3, 1955. On February 14, 1955, the Assistant Attorney General of Georgia wrote the Clerk of this Court that his office had been informed by Williams' counsel that "in all probability he would not participate in the oral argument of this case." The Clerk requested the attorney on February 18 to inform the Court of his plans. Under date of February 22, the attorney wrote to the Clerk as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Dear Sir:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At the present time, it does not appear that I will be able to come to Washington to present oral argument in the above case. I have little or nothing to add to the brief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is entirely agreeable, insofar as my agreement has any bearing, that the Attorney General's request in letter of February 14, 1955, [for permission to have two counsel present the State's case] be granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I am assuming that if events take such a turn that I am able to come to Washington, I will be permitted to make a short oral argument.&lt;/p&gt;
                                             "Yours very truly,"
&lt;p&gt;Under date of February 26, 1955, the Clerk sent the attorney the following letter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Dear Sir:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have spoken to the Chief Justice about the oral argument in this case and of the probability that you would not be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He asked me to inform you that the Court would appreciate your presenting oral argument if at all possible, particularly in view of the fact that this a capital case.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                    "Yours truly,"
&lt;p&gt;The attorney replied under date of February 28:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Dear Sir:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I am in this position about this case: I originally entered the case by appointment, before our General Assembly enacted legislation authorizing the payment of appointed counsel from the Treasury of Fulton County. This petitioner has no money. His family have made contributions which have in part paid actual expenses. At the present time, they have only paid one-half the cost of printing the brief, and in this situation, it appears that any expense connected with a trip to Washington will be out-of-pocket to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In addition, I am sole counsel in a suit in the Superior Court of Polk County, Georgia, on the calendar of that court for trial during the present week where my absence for any cause will have the result that payment of temporary alimony to my client will not be continued, which in turn, will have the result that I will lose the client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have appeared in the Supreme Court of Georgia twice in this case and have pursued it thus far in the Supreme Court of the United States at a considerable sacrifice. It has been my intention to present oral argument if at all possible. In view of the foregoing, however, it simply does not seem that I will be able to. If I can try the case in Polk Superior Court tomorrow (March 1st), there remains a possibility that I will be able to appear before the Supreme Court. I do not, however, believe such will be the case and for that reason, I cannot plan on going to Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                 "Very truly yours,"
&lt;p&gt;Oral argument was subsequently reset for April 18, 1955.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  The Solicitor General said at the end of his brief: ". . . In the Avery Case no negro jurors were drawn and impanelled. In this case 4 negro jurors were actually impanelled and sworn for the trial of this case. The mere fact that 3 were disqualified for cause and one was stricken peremptorily by the State would not suffice to show a course of systematic exclusion of negroes from the jury such as would amount to discrimination against the defendant in the trial of his case.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We respectfully submit that the facts alleged in the extraordinary motion for a new trial do not make out a case showing denial of equal protection of the law or due process of law under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and that under the authorities cited above the judgment of the trial judge in dismissing the extraordinary motion should be affirmed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Attorney General of the State, who also filed a brief on behalf of the State, did not discuss the constitutional question except in his concluding paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If, under the decision in the Avery case, there was in fact a discrimination against the movant in his trial, we do not say that he does not have some remedy at law but we do contend that the question is not ground for extraordinary motion for new trial and that the Court did not err in dismissing the same."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No other remedy was mentioned by the Georgia Supreme Court, and none has been called to our attention by the parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Parker&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Illinois,&lt;/i&gt; 333 U. S. 571; &lt;i&gt;Radio Station WOW, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Johnson,&lt;/i&gt; 326 U.

App.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;371&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 140 S. E. 402 (1927).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[13]  Under Georgia practice, the headnotes to cases are written by the court. The headnote in this case said: "&lt;i&gt;Held,&lt;/i&gt; that conviction for murder and sentence of death on the verdict of a juror so utterly destitute of truth and uprightness of character, would shock the conscience of civilization, and soil the purity of jury trial; and no matter how heinous the crime committed, the preservation of that purity is of more consequence than the speedy punishment of any one man for any one offense, and public policy, as well as individual right, demand a new trial."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Wallace&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;205&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;751&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 55 S. E. 2d 145 (1949), affidavits similar to those in the &lt;i&gt;Doyal&lt;/i&gt; case were presented by the defendant, but the State introduced positive affidavits to the effect that no such statements by the juror had been made. The headnote written by the Georgia Supreme Court stated: "There was no manifest abuse of discretion by the trial judge in overruling [this] ground of the extraordinary motion for a new trial, based upon conflicting evidence as to the alleged disqualification of the juror therein referred to." (205 Ga., at 752, 55 S. E. 2d, at 146.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[14]  In &lt;i&gt;Bloodworth&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;161&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;332&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 334, 131 S. E. 80, 81 (1925), it was stated that in a prior trial defendant was granted a new trial on an extraordinary motion after final judgment because a juror was disqualified.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Harris&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;150&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;680&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 104 S. E. 902 (1920), the defendant was sentenced to death for murder, a motion for a new trial was denied, and the judgment was affirmed on appeal. An extraordinary motion for new trial was overruled by the trial court, but the State Supreme Court reversed. The ground of the reversal was that after the jury had informed the judge that they could not agree, a deputy sheriff gave them the judge's message that he could not help them further, and then the deputy added, "the judge would keep them locked up until they did make a verdict," after which a verdict was brought in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[15]  Some of these cases are not entirely clear. For example, &lt;i&gt;Lumpkin&lt;/i&gt; stated that all objections to the impaneling of the grand jury should be made by challenge to the array before the indictment is found, where the illegality is known, or, if not known, by plea in abatement to the indictment; objections to "certain jurors" on the &lt;i&gt;trial&lt;/i&gt; jury should be raised by a challenge to the juror when put upon the defendant. This rule is cited in &lt;i&gt;Cornelious&lt;/i&gt; for the proposition that an objection to both grand and petit juries must be made by a challenge to the array before indictment or by plea in abatement before trial. In &lt;i&gt;Kato&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;33&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga. App.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;342&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 126 S. E. 266 (1925), the grand jury rule was applied to individual grand jurors rather than to the panel, and the challenge was said to be one to the array. And in &lt;i&gt;Moon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;68&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;687&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1882), it was said that an objection to a single juror should be made by a challenge to the array. Cf. note 16, &lt;i&gt;infra.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[16]  &lt;i&gt;E. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fudge&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;190&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;340&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 9 S. E. 2d 259 (1940); &lt;i&gt;Bryan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;124&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;79&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 52 S. E. 298 (1905); &lt;i&gt;Taylor&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;121&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;348&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 49 S. E. 303 (1904). In Georgia, challenges to the array go to the form and manner of making up the entire panel, whereas challenges to the poll are directed solely to the individual juror. See &lt;i&gt;Humphries&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;260&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 262, 28 S. E. 25, 26 (1897); &lt;i&gt;Mitchell&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;69&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga. App.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;771&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 776, 26 S. E. 2d 663, 667 (1943).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[17]  &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ga/7sgi/williams-v-state/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;210&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;665&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 668, 82 S. E. 2d 217, 219.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[18]  Even if extraordinary motion is the appropriate remedy, local practice may require Williams to be put to his proof. The State, for purposes of presenting its legal arguments, has not disputed the facts alleged in the extraordinary motion, but there has not been a hearing on those facts or an admission of their truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[19]  Cf. &lt;i&gt;Patterson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Alabama, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;Betts&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Brady,&lt;/i&gt; 316 U. S. 455.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The Court in &lt;i&gt;Patterson&lt;/i&gt; was more scrupulous about keeping its opinions on state procedure to itself. Here, the Court says:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Fair regard . . . for the constitutional commands binding on all courts compels us to reject the assumption that the courts of Georgia would allow this man to go to his death as the result of a conviction secured from a jury which the State admits was unconstitutionally impaneled."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This characterization is especially unfortunate in view of the fact that the state court, with full knowledge of all the facts, has already refused to order a new trial. See page 403, &lt;i&gt;infra.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Cf. the statement of the majority: "But the fact that we have jurisdiction does not compel us to exercise it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  This charge upon the integrity of a State Supreme Court is so serious that this Court has restricted such findings to cases where the state court decision lacked "fair support" in the state law. See &lt;i&gt;Rogers&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Alabama,&lt;/i&gt; 192 U. S. 226. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Fox Film Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Muller,&lt;/i&gt; 296 U. S. 207, 209.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  See &lt;i&gt;Davis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wechsler,&lt;/i&gt; 263 U. S. 22; &lt;i&gt;Iowa-Des Moines National Bank&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bennett,&lt;/i&gt; 284 U. S. 239, 247. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Missouri&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gehner,&lt;/i&gt; 281 U. S. 313 (1930).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  The cases cited by the majority are not helpful here. In &lt;i&gt;Rogers&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Alabama,&lt;/i&gt; 192 U. S. 226, the Alabama court struck a federal claim of discrimination on the ground that the pleading was prolix. The pleading was two pages in length. It goes without saying that the State was evading the issue. In &lt;i&gt;Abie State Bank&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bryan,&lt;/i&gt; 282 U. S. 765, the bank's constitutional plea that conditions had so changed as to make a state statute confiscatory was stricken on grounds of estoppel, the bank having acquiesced in the regulation for several years. Chief Justice Hughes held that "earlier compliance . . . does not forfeit the right of protest . . . ." 282 U. S., at 776. In view of the changed circumstances, the state ground unreasonably interfered with the vindication of a federal right. In &lt;i&gt;Pierre&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Louisiana,&lt;/i&gt; 306 U. S. 354, there was a timely objection, on federal grounds, to the systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand jury list. This Court first rejected the State's claim that the illegal composition was harmless error, and then affirmed the power of this Court to make an independent investigation of the facts. In &lt;i&gt;Urie&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Thompson,&lt;/i&gt; 337 U. S. 163, 172, Mr. Justice Rutledge in an FELA case held that, since the final judgment rule had prevented any earlier consideration by this Court, local practice rules could not bar this Court's consideration of "all substantial federal questions actually determined in earlier stages of the litigation." And in &lt;i&gt;Vandalia R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Indiana ex rel. South Bend,&lt;/i&gt; 207 U. S. 359, 367, Mr. Justice Brewer said, "Even if it be conceded that the conclusion of the Supreme Court of the State is not free from doubt, there is nothing to justify a suspicion that there was any intent to avoid the Federal questions. . . ." We agree that this is the test here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  &lt;i&gt;Smith&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga. App.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;574&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 59 S. E. 311, cited by the majority, is not to the contrary. There the court recognized that due diligence is required in making an extraordinary motion for new trial, and held, consistent with the Georgia practice of treating the various objections on an individual basis, that the requirement of ordinary diligence had been satisfied where counsel had interrogated the subsequently disqualified juror concerning his relation with the prosecutor and had obtained a negative answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  On May 26, 1953, on its front page, the Atlanta Constitution ran a complete story of the reversal of Avery's case here. It is interesting to note that an article in the same paper pointed out "that old cases in which convictions were obtained under the two-color jury selection system could not be reopened because objections must have been made at the time of the trial." The same day, the Atlanta Journal carried a story that Fulton County was "moving to ban different colored jury slips." The subhead on the article said, "Court ruling against practice draws prediction of action." This article concluded with a paragraph:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The change to all-white slips will have no effect on cases already adjudicated but will affect cases now in progress where the point of different colored jury slips has been raised."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case involves the disposition of two applications for construction permits for standard broadcast stations. One application was filed by the Easton Publishing Co. for Easton, Pennsylvania, and the other by the Allentown Broadcasting Corp. for Allentown, Pennsylvania. Both were for the same frequency, and, despite the fact that neither station would render service to the other community, simultaneous operation of the two stations would cause mutually destructive interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearings were first held in 1946 and resulted in the grant of the Allentown application. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the Commission and remanded the case for "findings upon the comparative needs of the two communities for new radio service and the relative abilities of the applicants to serve the greater need." 85 U. S. App. D. C. 33, 40, 175 F. 2d 344, 351.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New hearings were held in 1951 by an examiner whose initial decision recommended that the Allentown application be granted. Easton filed exceptions to that decision with the Commission, and after oral argument the Commission issued its final decision, disagreeing with its examiner and granting the station to Easton. The Commission made detailed findings of fact as to the qualifications of the applicants and the nature of the communities to be served. Most factors provided no basis for choosing between the applicants. Both were found legally, technically and otherwise qualified to become the licensee; both communities were equally in need of the programs proposed to be broadcast by each applicant. One factor, however, was crucial in determining, under &#167; 307 (b) of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*360&lt;/span&gt; the Communications Act,&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; which applicant should receive the license. Allentown had three local stations; Easton only one. The Commission recognized that Allentown was a city almost triple the size of Easton and growing at a greater pace, but held that Easton's need for a choice between locally originated programs was decisive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals reversed.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Its examination of the record in detail demonstrated to it that findings of fact of the Commission that overruled findings of the Hearing Examiner were erroneous. Since these Commission findings, it thought, were the basis for that body's ultimate finding of Easton's ability to serve, it directed the Commission to revaluate the "issue of the relative abilities of the two applicants to serve in the public interest." It held that there was no substantial evidence in the record to support the determination that "the ability of the applicants to serve their respective communities was about equal." It concluded that, without support for this underlying finding, it was improper to apply the "choice of local service" principle. In view of the importance to the administration of the Act, certiorari was granted to review this decision. 348 U. S. 910.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more important question presented by this certiorari, as stated by petitioner, is whether the Federal Communications Commission, in awarding AM licenses between mutually exclusive applicants for different communities, can select one community over another on the basis of the former's need only if it has first found that the applicants are approximately equal in their ability to serve their respective communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*361&lt;/span&gt; The judgment of the Court of Appeals that such a preliminary finding was necessary was predicated upon the requirement of its earlier decision in this same controversy, which was not appealed, that there must be, as stated above, findings not only on comparative needs of the communities but also as to the "relative abilities of the applicants to serve the greater need." 85 U. S. App. D. C., at 40, 175 F. 2d, at 351. The Court of Appeals, as we understand its opinion in the present case, thought that the "choice of local service" principle applied only where community need and applicant ability to serve such need were both approximately equal.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission challenges this position. It asserts that, when mutually exclusive applicants seek authority to serve different communities, the Commission first determines which community has the greater need for additional services and then determines which applicant can best serve that community's need. Otherwise, argues the Commission, the needs of the community would be &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*362&lt;/span&gt; subordinated to the ability of an applicant for another locality. The position of the Commission was made quite clear in its judgment on Allentown's petition for rehearing.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We agree with the contention of the Commission. Section 307 (b), note 1, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; empowers the Commission to allow licenses so as to provide a fair distribution among communities. Fairness to communities is furthered by a recognition of local needs for a community radio mouthpiece. The distribution of a second license to a community in order to secure local competition for originating and broadcasting programs of local interest appears to us to be likewise within the allowable area of discretion. There are other instances of Commission use of community allocation of licenses to secure local means of expression.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*363&lt;/span&gt; The record of the second hearing shows that the Commission had before it substantial evidence to support its conclusion as to Easton's need and its applicant's superior capacity to serve that need. In appraising the evidence as to the day and night existing radio service of the two communities, their proposed local programs and their staffs, the Commission concluded that there was little room for choice between communities except for the decisive factor of Easton's need for a competitive standard broadcast service that Allentown already had. Since only the Easton applicant proposed to originate programs in and for Easton, the Commission awarded the license to that applicant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reaching its conclusion to set aside the Commission's order awarding the license to Easton, the Court of Appeals found that the Commission's reversal of its Hearing Examiner was erroneous. That court analyzed the evidence before the Commission as to Easton's uncertainty on affiliating with radio networks to secure their programs for its listeners, the reluctance, evasiveness and lack of candor of Easton's principal witnesses and the concentration of local communications media in the hands of the Easton applicant who was the publisher of the only local newspaper, the licensee of one of two FM radio stations and of the only television station. The court agreed with the Examiner and overruled the Commission. None of the above circumstances are in themselves a bar to the Commission's grant of license. Each involves appraisals of testimony that put into a record facts derived from various witnesses by interrogation. There was substantial &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*364&lt;/span&gt; evidence considering the whole record that had to be weighed, pro and con, as to types of programs, evasiveness of witnesses, and the desirability of allocating an additional license to an applicant who already controlled other means of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals' conclusion of error as to evasiveness relies largely on its understanding that the Examiner's findings based on demeanor of a witness are not to be overruled by a Board without a "very substantial preponderance in the testimony as recorded," citing &lt;i&gt;Labor Board&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Universal Camera Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 190 F. 2d 429, 430. We think this attitude goes too far. It seems to adopt for examiners of administrative agencies the "clearly erroneous" rule of the Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 52 (a), applicable to courts. In &lt;i&gt;Universal Camera Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Labor Board,&lt;/i&gt; 340 U. S. 474, 492, we said, as to the Labor Management Relations Act hearings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Section 10 (c) of the Labor Management Relations Act provides that `If upon the preponderance of the testimony taken the Board shall be of the opinion that any person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair labor practice, then the Board shall state its findings of fact . . . .' 61 Stat. 147, 29 U. S. C. (Supp. III) &#167; 160 (c). The responsibility for decision thus placed on the Board is wholly inconsistent with the notion that it has power to reverse an examiner's findings only when they are `clearly erroneous.' Such a limitation would make so drastic a departure from prior administrative practice that explicitness would be required."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That comment is here applicable. See also &#167; 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 60 Stat. 242.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Communications Act gives the Commission the power of ruling on facts and policies in the first instance. But its rulings are subject to review by the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*365&lt;/span&gt; Courts of Appeals within the scope defined by &lt;i&gt;Universal Camera Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Labor Board,&lt;/i&gt; 340 U. S. 474, and &lt;i&gt;Labor Board&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pittsburgh Steamship Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 340 U. S. 498. The correction of errors of law by a Court of Appeals on review of administrative agencies is committed to this Court through its certiorari jurisdiction. We have found such errors of law in the decision of the Court of Appeals. Therefore, the decision below cannot stand. But it is not our function to reinstate the determination of the Commission. That would make this Court the reviewing body of the ultimate determination of the Commission. The proper disposition is to remand the case to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration of the record but freed from rulings declared erroneous in this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1]  "In considering applications for licenses, and modifications and renewals thereof, when and insofar as there is demand for the same, the Commission shall make such distribution of licenses, frequencies, hours of operation, and of power among the several States and communities as to provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of radio service to each of the same." 47 U.

&lt;p&gt;[3]  The court said:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This `choice of local service' principle is a gloss on &#167; 307 (b) of the Communications Act of 1934, &lt;i&gt;supra.&lt;/i&gt; It was first applied by the Commission in Northwestern Ohio Broadcasting Corp., upon the crucial findings that the choice between the two communities was `indeed a difficult one,' and that both applicants `propose[d] to render meritorious program services designed to meet the needs of the respective communities . . . .' Since we affirmed on appeal because there was `no error in the record,' our approval of the `choice of local service' principle was limited to its application in circumstances of otherwise approximately equivalent community need and applicant ability to serve such need. Although in the present case the Commission purported to find such equivalence, we think there is no substantial evidence in the record as a whole&#151;including the Hearing Examiner's Initial Decision&#151;to support the essential underlying finding that the ability of the applicants to serve their respective communities was about equal. Hence, we hold the Commission's error is fatal to the order under review and requires that the case be remanded for reconsideration by the Commission."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  "This is not a case in which the Commission is called upon to consider the comparative qualifications of two or more applicants proposing to serve the same community; instead, it is a case in which one of the applicants proposes to serve Easton, Pennsylvania, and the other Allentown, Pennsylvania and neither would provide service to the other community. Under such circumstances, the primary determination to be made is that required by Section 307 (b) of the Communications Act; namely, how best to distribute licenses among the several states and communities as `to provide a fair, efficient and equitable distribution of radio service to each of the same.' In the present case, having determined that Easton, Pennsylvania with only one standard broadcast station was in substantially greater need of a second local facility than the Allentown community which already has four standard broadcast stations, we went on to consider, in accordance with the mandate of the Court of Appeals in the first Easton decision, which of the two applicants would best serve the needs of Easton, Pennsylvania and found that the Easton Publishing Company was such applicant." 9 Pike &amp;amp; Fischer Radio Regulation 889.

&lt;center&gt;Decided June 6, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shields M. Goodwin&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alston Jennings&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Edward L. Wright.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*409&lt;/span&gt; MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carroll, the petitioner, was an employee of Hogan, an intervenor, who in turn was a subcontractor doing work for the respondent Lanza, the general contractor. Carroll and Hogan were residents of Missouri; and Carroll's employment contract with Hogan was made in Missouri. The work, however, was done in Arkansas; and it was there that the injury occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carroll, not aware that he had remedies under the Arkansas law, received 34 weekly payments for the injury under the Missouri Compensation Act. The Missouri Act is applicable to injuries received inside or outside the State where the employment contract, as here, is made in the State. Mo. Rev. Stat., 1949, &#167; 287.110. The Missouri Act also provides that every employer and employee shall be "conclusively presumed to have elected to accept" its provisions unless "prior to the accident" he shall have filed with the compensation commission a written notice that he "elects" to reject the compensation provision. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; &#167; 287.060. No such notice, however, was filed in this case. Moreover, the Missouri Act provides that the rights and remedies granted by it "shall exclude all other rights and remedies . . . at common law or otherwise," on account of the injury or death.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; &#167; 287.120.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*410&lt;/span&gt; Arkansas also has provisions for workmen's compensation. Ark. Stat., 1947, &#167; 81-1301 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; It provides the exclusive remedy of the employee against the employer (&lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; &#167; 81-1304) but not against a third party. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; &#167; 81-1340. And the court below, on review of Arkansas authorities, concluded that a general contractor, such as Lanza, the respondent, was a third party within the meaning of the Arkansas Act. And see &lt;i&gt;Baldwin Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maner,&lt;/i&gt; ___ Ark. ___, 273 S. W. 2d 28.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Carroll was receiving weekly payments under the Missouri Act, he decided to sue Lanza for common-law damages in the Arkansas courts. Lanza had the case removed to the Federal District Court where judgment was rendered for Carroll.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; 116 F. Supp. 491. The Court of Appeals, while agreeing with the District Court that the judgment was sustainable as a matter of Arkansas law, reversed on the ground that the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; (Art. IV, &#167; 1) barred recovery. 216 F. 2d 808. The case is here by petition for certiorari which we granted (348 U. S. 870) because of doubts as to the correctness of the decision raised by &lt;i&gt;Pacific Employers Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commission,&lt;/i&gt; 306 U. S. 493.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals thought &lt;i&gt;Magnolia Petroleum Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hunt,&lt;/i&gt; 320 U. S. 430, to be controlling. There the employee having received a &lt;i&gt;final award&lt;/i&gt; for compensation &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*411&lt;/span&gt; in the forum of the injury returned to his home State and sued to recover under its Compensation Act. We held that the latter suit was precluded by the Full Faith and Credit Clause. But here there was no final award under the Missouri Act. Under that Act the statutory payments apparently start automatically on receipt of notice of the injury. Mo. Rev. Stat., 1949, &#167;&#167; 287.380, 287.400. While provision is made for an adjudication of disputes between an employee and his employer (&lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; &#167;&#167; 287.400, 287.450), no adjudication was sought or obtained here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor do we have a case where an employee, knowing of two remedies which purport to be mutually exclusive, chooses one as against the other and therefore is precluded a second choice by the law of the forum. Rather we have the naked question whether the Full Faith and Credit Clause makes Missouri's statute a bar to Arkansas' common-law remedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A statute is a "public act" within the meaning of the Full Faith and Credit Clause. See &lt;i&gt;Bradford Electric Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Clapper,&lt;/i&gt; 286 U. S. 145, 154-155, and cases cited; &lt;i&gt;Alaska Packers Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commission,&lt;/i&gt; 294 U. S. 532. It was indeed held in the &lt;i&gt;Clapper&lt;/i&gt; case that a Vermont Compensation Act, which purported to give an exclusive remedy, barred a common-law action on the same claim in the New Hampshire courts by a Vermont employee against a Vermont employer, even though the injury occurred in New Hampshire. The &lt;i&gt;Clapper&lt;/i&gt; case allowed a State to fix one exclusive remedy for personal injuries involving its residents, and required the other States to refuse to enforce any inconsistent remedy. Thus, as respects persons residing or businesses located in a State, a remedy was provided employees that was "both expeditious and independent of proof of fault," and a liability was imposed on employers that was "limited and determinate." 286 U. S., at 159.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*412&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Pacific Employers Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commission,&lt;/i&gt; 306 U. S. 493, departed, however, from the &lt;i&gt;Clapper&lt;/i&gt; decision. There a resident of Massachusetts regularly employed in Massachusetts by a Massachusetts corporation was injured while doing temporary duty in California. The Massachusetts Compensation Act purported to give an exclusive remedy, even for injuries incurred beyond its borders. But California also had a Compensation Act which undertook to fix liability on employers, irrespective of any contract, rule, or regulation, a provision which the California courts strictly enforced. The Court, therefore, held that the exclusive nature of the Massachusetts Act was "obnoxious" to the policy of California. The Court proceeded on the premise, repeated over and again in the cases, that the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not require a State to substitute for its own statute, applicable to persons and events within it, the statute of another State reflecting a conflicting and opposed policy. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 502.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Pacific Employers Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; case allowed the Compensation Act of the place of the injury to override the Compensation Act of the home State. Here it is a common-law action that is asserted against the exclusiveness of the remedy of the home State; and that is seized on as marking a difference. That is not in our judgment a material difference. Whatever deprives the remedy of the home State of its exclusive character qualifies or contravenes the policy of that State and denies it full faith and credit, if full faith and credit is due. But the &lt;i&gt;Pacific Employers Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; case teaches that in these personal injury cases the State where the injury occurs need not be a vassal to the home State and allow only that remedy which the home State has marked as the exclusive one. The State of the forum also has interests to serve and to protect. Here Arkansas has opened its courts to negligence suits against prime contractors, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*413&lt;/span&gt; refusing to make relief by way of workmen's compensation the exclusive remedy. &lt;i&gt;Baldwin Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maner, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; Her interests are large and considerable and are to be weighed not only in the light of the facts of this case but by the kind of situation presented. For we write not only for this case and this day alone, but for this type of case. The State where the tort occurs certainly has a concern in the problems following in the wake of the injury. The problems of medical care and of possible dependents are among these, as &lt;i&gt;Pacific Employers Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commission, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; emphasizes. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 501. A State that legislates concerning them is exercising traditional powers of sovereignty. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Watson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Employers Liability Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 348 U. S. 66, 73. Arkansas therefore has a legitimate interest in opening her courts to suits of this nature, even though in this case Carroll's injury may have cast no burden on her or on her institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a case like &lt;i&gt;Hughes&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fetter,&lt;/i&gt; 341 U. S. 609, where the State of the forum seeks to exclude from its courts actions arising under a foreign statute. In that case, we held that Wisconsin could not refuse to entertain a wrongful death action under an Illinois statute for an injury occurring in Illinois, since we found no sufficient policy considerations to warrant such refusal. And see &lt;i&gt;Broderick&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rosner,&lt;/i&gt; 294 U. S. 629. The present case is a much weaker one for application of the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Arkansas, the State of the forum, is not adopting any policy of hostility to the public Acts of Missouri. It is choosing to apply its own rule of law to give affirmative relief for an action arising within its borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missouri can make her Compensation Act exclusive, if she chooses, and enforce it as she pleases within her borders. Once that policy is extended into other States, different considerations come into play. Arkansas can adopt Missouri's policy if she likes. Or, as the &lt;i&gt;Pacific&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*414&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Employers Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; case teaches, she may supplement it or displace it with another, insofar as remedies for acts occurring within her boundaries are concerned. Were it otherwise, the State where the injury occurred would be powerless to provide any remedies or safeguards to nonresident employees working within its borders. We do not think the Full Faith and Credit Clause demands that subserviency from the State of the injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE BURTON and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to place the problems presented by this case in the proper context for adjudication, it has seemed to me desirable to examine the course of the Court's decisions touching the constitutional requirement for giving full faith and credit to statutes of a sister State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases fall into three main groups:&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Those in which the forum was called upon to give effect to a sister-state statute and declined to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

S. 514.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*415&lt;/span&gt; From these cases it appears that the forum cannot, by statute or otherwise, refuse to enforce a sister-state statute giving a transitory cause of action, whether in contract or tort. &lt;i&gt;E. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Broderick&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rosner, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hughes&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fetter, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; Indeed, the forum may permissibly go a step in the other direction and disregard the venue provisions of an out-of-state statute which would have prevented the forum from enforcing the right. &lt;i&gt;Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp;amp; R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;George, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; The forum may, however, apply its own more restrictive statute of limitations to an outside wrongful death action, &lt;i&gt;Wells&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Simonds Abrasive Co., supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; and dicta indicate that it may refuse to enforce a penal law, a law found antagonistic to the forum's public policy, or a law which requires specialized proceedings or remedies not available in the forum, see &lt;i&gt;Broderick&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rosner,&lt;/i&gt; 294 U. S., at 642-643; &lt;i&gt;Hughes&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fetter,&lt;/i&gt; 341 U. S., at 612.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) Those in which the forum applied its own statute rather than that of a sister State because the latter was not of limiting exclusiveness, or in which the forum applied the sister-state statute because the forum's was not exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Bond&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hume,&lt;/i&gt; 243 U. S. 15; &lt;i&gt;Ohio&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chattanooga Boiler &amp;amp; Tank Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 289 U. S. 439; &lt;i&gt;Industrial Commission&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McCartin,&lt;/i&gt; 330 U. S. 622. See also &lt;i&gt;Bonaparte&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tax Court,&lt;/i&gt; 104 U.

&lt;p&gt;These cases prove that, where the statute of either the forum or the outside State is not found to be exclusive regarding remedies or rights elsewhere, the statute need not be accorded exclusive effect. Further, the Court has stated that, in the area of workmen's compensation, "unmistakable language" is required before exclusiveness will be attributed. See &lt;i&gt;Industrial Commission&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McCartin,&lt;/i&gt; 330 U. S., at 628.&lt;/p&gt;

Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 313 U. S. 487; &lt;i&gt;Griffin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McCoach,&lt;/i&gt; 313 U. S. 498; &lt;i&gt;Pink&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;A. A. A. Highway Express, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 314 U.

S. 469; &lt;i&gt;Order of United Commercial Travelers&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wolfe,&lt;/i&gt; 331 U. S. 586.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cases have arisen in three principal fields: (a) commercial law; (b) insurance; and (c) workmen's compensation. As a statistical matter, in 21 cases of direct conflict the Court held for the forum 10 times and for the sister State 11 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) In commercial law a number of cases have involved statutory assessment against out-of-state shareholders under the laws of the State of incorporation of an insolvent corporation. The Court's consistent position has &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*417&lt;/span&gt; been that the law of the incorporating State must be given effect by the forum. &lt;i&gt;E. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Converse&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hamilton, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; That law is deemed to create a transitory cause of action based on the contractual relation between the corporation and the shareholder by which the shareholder is held to have consented to reasonable state regulation. The Court has relied on the fact that in each case a judicial proceeding in the incorporating State had previously passed upon the necessity and amount of the assessment, and that, although shareholders in the forum were not parties to such a proceeding, their interest was adequately represented by other shareholders. Personal defenses, such as the nonexistence of the shareholder relation, may still be asserted. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Pink&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;A. A. A. Highway Express, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 314 U. S., at 208.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the commercial context is not that of shareholder-corporation but simple contract, the Court has found less need for uniformity and accordingly has given greater leeway to the forum on a showing of substantial interest in the contract, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; that one of the parties is a resident of the forum or that the contract is to be performed within its borders. The Court has spoken of the presumed acceptance of the forum's laws by a corporation doing business in the forum. &lt;i&gt;National Mutual Building &amp;amp; Loan Association&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Brahan, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; In other cases the argument has been narrower, for instance that the forum can control an incidental item of damages such as interest. &lt;i&gt;Klaxon Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; Occasionally reliance has rested on ordinary conflict of laws doctrine. See &lt;i&gt;Olmsted&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Olmsted, supra&lt;/i&gt; (holding that the forum can exclusively control disposition of land within its borders).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) The insurance cases reflect considerations similar to those in the commercial cases. The Court has found in fraternal benefit societies an "indivisible unity" among the members and a resultant need for uniform construction &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*418&lt;/span&gt; of rights and duties in the common fund. &lt;i&gt;E. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Order of United Commercial Travelers&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wolfe, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; Hence the law of the society's home State (and bylaws adopted under it) has prevailed. The Court has been able to draw support from decisions of the home State validating either the practice under question or one similar to it. (The cases have involved increase of dues, presumption of death from long absence, &lt;i&gt;ultra vires&lt;/i&gt; certificates, and time limitation on bringing suit.) In an analogous situation, the forum has prevailed on the question whether an individual is in fact an assessable member of a mutual insurance company (rather than a mere policyholder), on the ground that the interpretation and legal effect of the contract is peculiarly within the competence and sphere of interest of the forum. &lt;i&gt;Pink&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;A. A. A. Highway Express, Inc., supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to ordinary insurance contracts, the forum has had a much wider scope. The Court has balanced the interests of the competing jurisdictions, including factors such as the residence of the insured, where premiums were paid or payable, where the policy was applied for and delivered, where the insured died, what law the policy itself provided should govern, and whether loan agreements and new policies were ancillary to the initial policy. The forum has been permitted to protect its residents against insurance companies, but the Court has required the forum to have more than a casual interest. It has not been sufficient, for example, that the forum was the State of initial issue of the policy on which a defaulted loan was obtained, &lt;i&gt;New York Life Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Head, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; or the place of issue of a converted policy and the residence at death of the insured, &lt;i&gt;Aetna Life Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dunken, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; or the place where suit has been brought, &lt;i&gt;John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Yates, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; On the other hand, the forum would succeed if it asserted a strong local policy requiring an insurable &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*419&lt;/span&gt; interest, see &lt;i&gt;Griffin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McCoach, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; or a reserve requirement more stringent than that of the State of incorporation, &lt;i&gt;State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Duel, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(c) In workmen's compensation cases the Court has likewise adopted an interests-weighing approach. The relevant considerations have been: the place of the employment contract; the residence of the parties; the place of injury; the possibility of the workman becoming a public charge in the State seeking to award compensation, see &lt;i&gt;Alaska Packers Association&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Industrial Accident Comm'n, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;;&lt;/i&gt; the interest of a State in securing prompt payment of medical fees to its residents, see &lt;i&gt;Pacific Employers Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Industrial Accident Comm'n, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;;&lt;/i&gt; the aspect of exclusiveness of the foreign statute, see &lt;i&gt;Industrial Commission&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McCartin, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;;&lt;/i&gt; the State's interest in the bodily safety and economic protection of workers within it; the difference between a defense (which if rejected results in irremediable liability) and a cause of action (which if not allowed in one State can be pursued in another), see &lt;i&gt;Bradford Electric Light Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Clapper, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;;&lt;/i&gt; the amount of work to be performed in a State, see &lt;i&gt;Cardillo&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;;&lt;/i&gt; and the policy of determinate liability and prompt remedy underlying workmen's compensation acts. The Court first enunciated the rule that the forum must permit a defense based on the exclusiveness of the sister-state statute where the only contact of the forum was that it was the place of injury. &lt;i&gt;Bradford Electric Light Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Clapper, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; Conversely, the Court held that the place of contract could award compensation though the injury occurred elsewhere. &lt;i&gt;Alaska Packers Association&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Industrial Accident Comm'n, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; Subsequently, the Court held that the forum could prevail, even though the parties resided and the contract was entered in another State whose statute was exclusive, if &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*420&lt;/span&gt; the injury occurred in the forum and enforcement of the defense of the outside statute was deemed "obnoxious" to the forum's policy. &lt;i&gt;Pacific Employers Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Industrial Accident Comm'n, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In applying to the immediate situation the fair guidance offered by the past decisions of the Court regarding full faith and credit, a number of considerations become apparent:&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; (1) Unlike the other workmen's compensation cases&#151;or, for that matter, any of the cases in which the forum has prevailed in a conflict between the forum and the outside law&#151;the interest of the forum here is solely dependent on the occurrence of the injury within its borders. No rights of Arkansas residents are involved, since none of the parties is an Arkansan; the workman was removed immediately to a Missouri hospital and has, so far as appears, remained in Missouri. What &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*421&lt;/span&gt; might be regarded as the societal interest of Arkansas in the protection of the bodily safety of workers within its borders is an interest equally true of any jurisdiction where a workman is injured and exactly the sort of interest which New Hampshire had in &lt;i&gt;Clapper.&lt;/i&gt; (2) Thus, the Court is squarely faced with the &lt;i&gt;Clapper&lt;/i&gt; problem.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; To make the interest of Arkansas prevail over the interest of Missouri on the basis of the Full Faith and Credit Clause would require that &lt;i&gt;Clapper&lt;/i&gt; be explicitly overruled and that, in the area of workmen's compensation law, the place of injury be decisive. And if &lt;i&gt;Clapper&lt;/i&gt; is to be overruled, on which I and those who join me express no opinion, it should be done with reasons making manifest why Mr. Justice Brandeis' long-matured, weighty opinion in that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*422&lt;/span&gt; case was ill-founded. It should not be cast aside on the presupposition that full faith and credit need not be given to a sister-state workmen's compensation statute if the law of the forum happens to be more favorable to the claimant. (3) Furthermore, the new provision of 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1738 cannot be disregarded. In 1948 Congress for the first time dealt with the full faith and credit effect to be given statutes.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; The absence of such a provision was used by Mr. Justice Stone to buttress the Court's opinions both in &lt;i&gt;Alaska Packers,&lt;/i&gt; 294 U. S., at 547, and &lt;i&gt;Pacific Employers,&lt;/i&gt; 306 U. S., at 502. Hence, if &#167; 1738 has any effect, it would seem to tend toward respecting Missouri's legislation. See Reese, Full Faith and Credit to Statutes: The Defense of Public Policy, 19 U. of Chi. L. Rev. 339, 343 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a readily available alternative short of overruling &lt;i&gt;Clapper&lt;/i&gt; which dispenses with the difficulties inherent in applying the Full Faith and Credit Clause. This alternative proceeds along the following lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missouri's workmen's compensation statute is in terms applicable and exclusive as to workmen injured outside the State under Missouri employment contracts.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; Hogan &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*423&lt;/span&gt; (the subcontractor here) was a Missouri employer and had a Missouri employment contract with Carroll (the injured workman). Thus when Carroll sought workmen's compensation in Arkansas (where he was hurt), Hogan and his insurer could have relied on the Missouri statute and the &lt;i&gt;Clapper&lt;/i&gt; case as a defense. They did not, presumably since Arkansas workmen's compensation cost them no more than Missouri's and they had an opportunity to recoup from the prime contractor as a third party under Arkansas law.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Lanza (the prime contractor) was not a Missouri employer, nor does the record disclose that he had a Missouri employment contract either with Hogan or Carroll. The basic contract between Lanza and Hogan was on a Louisiana letterhead and is a contract for work apparently to be performed exclusively in Arkansas. Hogan promised to furnish workmen and "It is further understood that . . . Hogan . . . will carry the necessary insurance on his men in according [&lt;i&gt;sic&lt;/i&gt;] with the rules of the state of Arkansas." The supplemental contract for the particular &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*424&lt;/span&gt; work on which Carroll was injured consisted of a letter bid by Hogan to Lanza and a letter reply authorizing Hogan to proceed. From the point of view of choice of law, the various aspects of the contract combine to make it governed either by Arkansas or Louisiana&#151;but not Missouri&#151;law. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Johnson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Great Lakes Pipe Line Co.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;358&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Mo.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;445&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 215 S. W. 2d 460.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Missouri workmen's compensation statute provides that "Where a third person is liable to the employee . . . for the injury or death, the employer shall be subrogated. . . and the recovery by such employer shall not be limited to the amount payable as compensation to such employee . . . ." Mo. Rev. Stat., 1949, &#167; 287.150. The Missouri Supreme Court has read this provision as allowing a common-law action by a worker against a negligent third party, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Schumacher&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Leslie,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/mo/8MCV/schumacher-v-leslie/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;360&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Mo.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1238&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 232 S. W. 2d 913, on the theory that the worker may secure common-law recovery against anyone " `upon whom no liability could be entailed under the Act,' " 360 Mo., at 1246, 232 S. W. 2d, at 918.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Missouri Supreme Court has held that a prime contractor is not liable as a third party for his negligence to an employee of a subcontractor. &lt;i&gt;Bunner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Patti,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;343&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Mo.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;274&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 121 S. W. 2d 153; see also &lt;i&gt;New Amsterdam Casualty Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Boaz-Kiel Construction Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 115 F. 2d 950 (C. A. 8th Cir.). And this because prime contractors are subject to liability under the workmen's compensation statute, which states: "Any person who has work done under contract on or about his premises which is an operation of the usual business which he there carries on shall be deemed an employer and shall be liable under this chapter to such contractor, his subcontractors, and their employees, when injured or killed on or about the premises of the employer . . . . [T]he immediate contractor . . . shall be liable as an employer of the employees of his subcontractors.. . . No such employer shall be liable . . . if &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*425&lt;/span&gt; the employee was insured by his immediate or any intermediate employer." Mo. Rev. Stat., 1949, &#167; 287.040.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rationale of the Missouri decisions prohibiting a negligence action against a prime contractor is this: a person clearly subject to statutory liability cannot be sued as a third party. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Schumacher&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Leslie,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/mo/8MCV/schumacher-v-leslie/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;360&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Mo.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1238&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 1247, 232 S. W. 2d 913, 918. But the Missouri rule has only been applied in cases where three preconditions were present: (a) all parties were subject to the Missouri workmen's compensation act; (b) the prime and subcontractor were doing business in Missouri; and (c) the injury took place on a project in Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the circumstances of the case before us, there is no basis for finding that Missouri would deem Lanza to be a Missouri employer and as such subject to liability for Missouri workmen's compensation. His contract had no Missouri ties other than the bare fact that the subcontractor was a Missouri resident.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; And there is no indication that Lanza has ever done business in Missouri. Furthermore, Missouri requires that a defendant in a negligence suit who relies on the exclusiveness of the workmen's compensation statute must plead and prove as an affirmative defense that the parties are subject to it, &lt;i&gt;Kemper&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gluck,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;327&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Mo.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;733&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 39 S. W. 2d 330, a burden which Lanza certainly has not met. See &lt;i&gt;State ex rel. St. Louis Car Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hostetter,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;345&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Mo.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;102&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 131 S. W. 2d 558. Thus there is no warrant for believing that the Missouri courts would refuse to allow suit against him as an ordinary third party. Presumably, then, Carroll could sue Lanza under either Missouri or Arkansas law for his negligence. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*426&lt;/span&gt; Accordingly, the constitutional question presented should not be passed on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we ought not to rest on the initial determination of Missouri law here. In a number of the full faith and credit cases this Court has remanded for further consideration of state law. &lt;i&gt;E. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Klaxon Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Stentor Elec. Mfg.

&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The Missouri Supreme Court has construed the Missouri Compensation Act as providing the exclusive remedy, even when, as here, the employee of the subcontractor sues the general contractor for common-law damages. &lt;i&gt;Bunner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Patti,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;343&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Mo.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;274&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 283, 121 S. W. 2d 153, 156-157. The touchstone seems to be the existence of a Missouri employment contract, such as exists in the present case, wherever the injury may have occurred. We can find no suggestion in the Missouri cases that the Missouri Compensation Act is not the exclusive remedy against the prime contractor when his contract with the subcontractor is made outside Missouri. No such suggestion is made by any of the parties to this litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Hogan and his Indemnity Company, intervenors, were granted a lien on the judgment in favor of Carroll for the amounts paid to Carroll as compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Article IV, &#167; 1 of the Constitution provides:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Two other groups of cases do not here concern us: those holding that a full faith and credit contention must be properly raised in the lower courts, see &lt;i&gt;Chicago &amp;amp; Alton Railroad&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wiggins Ferry Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 119 U. S. 615, and those holding that a mere misconstruction by the forum of the laws of a sister State is not a violation of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, see &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gold Issue Mining &amp;amp; Milling Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 243 U. S. 93.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Stated shortly, the facts of this case are: Carroll, a Missourian, entered into a Missouri employment contract with Hogan, who operated a Missouri painting company. Hogan in turn contracted with Lanza, a Louisiana electrical contractor, to do painting on a federal project in Arkansas for which Lanza had a government contract. While on the job in Arkansas, Carroll was injured. Hogan's insurer voluntarily began to pay workmen's compensation to Carroll pursuant to Missouri law, though no formal proceedings or award were had. Thereafter, Carroll brought suit against Lanza in an Arkansas state court, alleging that his injury was caused by the negligence of Lanza's employees. Since there was diversity of citizenship, Lanza removed the case to federal court. He then moved for summary judgment, claiming that the Missouri workmen's compensation law, to which Carroll was subject, afforded an exclusive remedy. The court rejected this contention and rendered an $18,000 judgment for Carroll. 116 F. Supp. 491. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, relying on &lt;i&gt;Magnolia Petroleum Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hunt,&lt;/i&gt; 320 U. S. 430, reversed on the ground that full faith and credit required Arkansas to give effect to what the court treated as a final and exclusive award in the payments received under the Missouri statute. 216 F. 2d 808.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dissent agrees with the Court that the Court of Appeals misapplied &lt;i&gt;Magnolia&lt;/i&gt; to the facts of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Concededly the &lt;i&gt;Pacific Employers&lt;/i&gt; case narrowed what was said in &lt;i&gt;Clapper.&lt;/i&gt; The Court there found the conjunction of four factors decisive in upholding the California Supreme Court's determination that the Massachusetts statute was "obnoxious" to the public policy of California: (1) medical services were rendered in California and directly reimbursable from the California award; if California could not make an award, its residents would be remitted to Massachusetts and Massachusetts remedies to recover for their services; (2) bodily safety and economic protection of workers within its boundaries is a relevant interest of the forum; (3) the California statute provided: "No contract, rule, or regulation shall exempt the employer from liability . . . ."; (4) Congress had not yet passed legislation prescribing the full faith and credit effect to be given to statutes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinctions between that case and the one now at bar are to be noted. Of course we are not deciding this case as an isolated instance. But we are passing on the elements of this situation and not of some other situation. The decision here will govern other cases of the same type. The circumstances of this case define the content of the type. That is the essence of the theory of balancing the societal interests of the forum State against those of a sister State. It is that which lies behind the statement that "the full faith and credit clause is not an inexorable and unqualified command," &lt;i&gt;Pink&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;A. A. A. Highway Express, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 314 U. S. 201, 210. But this does not mean that it is no command&#151;that each State is at large to apply its own laws in disregard of greater interests of a sister State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  The first two paragraphs of the section deal with the problem of authentication. The third paragraph provides: "&lt;i&gt;Such Acts,&lt;/i&gt; records and judicial proceedings . . . shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States . . . as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State . . . from which they are taken." (Italics supplied.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to 1948 the quoted sentence did not include "Such Acts." Instead, it began: "&lt;i&gt;And the said&lt;/i&gt; records and judicial proceedings," etc. (Italics supplied.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  "Every employer and every employee, except as in this chapter otherwise provided, shall be conclusively presumed to have elected to accept the provisions of this chapter . . . unless prior to the accident he shall have filed with the commission a written notice that he elects to reject this chapter." Mo. Laws 1953, p. 535, &#167; 1.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This chapter shall apply to . . . all injuries received outside of this state under contract of employment made in this state, unless the contract of employment in any case shall otherwise provide." Mo. Rev. Stat., 1949, &#167; 287.110.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The rights and remedies herein granted to an employee, shall exclude all other rights and remedies of such employee . . . at common law or otherwise, on account of such accidental injury or death, except such rights and remedies as are not provided for by this chapter." Mo. Rev. Stat., 1949, &#167; 287.120.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  Hogan was covered by his insurer both in Missouri and Arkansas. The insurer initially paid Carroll $30 a week, the maximum under the Missouri workmen's compensation law. When Carroll sought to transfer to Arkansas compensation, the insurer began to pay him $25 a week, the maximum under the Arkansas statute. Arkansas law allows an injured workman to sue a prime contractor for negligence, see &lt;i&gt;Baldwin Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maner,&lt;/i&gt; ___ Ark. ___, 273 S. W. 2d 28; &lt;i&gt;Anderson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sanderson &amp;amp; Porter,&lt;/i&gt; 146 F. 2d 58 (C. A. 8th Cir.), and his immediate employer and the insurer of his immediate employer have a statutory lien on two-thirds of any recovery, Ark. Stat. Ann., &#167; 81-1340.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  Nor is there any hint that Lanza was attempting to evade statutory responsibility to Carroll by setting up a financially irresponsible subcontractor, an evasion which has been called the "prime purpose" of the statutory provision as to prime contractors. &lt;i&gt;Wors&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tarlton,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;234&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Mo.

ADAMS, DEAN OF ADMISSIONS, UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;No. 294, Misc.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided October 10, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
APPLICATION TO VACATE ORDER GRANTING STAY OF INJUNCTION PENDING APPEAL AND TO REINSTATE INJUNCTION PENDING APPEAL.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Arthur D. Shores, Constance Baker Motley, Robert L. Carter&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Thurgood Marshall&lt;/i&gt; for petitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Frontis H. Moore&lt;/i&gt; for respondent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PER CURIAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners, Autherine J. Lucy and Polly Anne Myers, citizens of Alabama, have been seeking admission to the University of Alabama since September 1952. Respondent William F. Adams is Dean of Admissions of the University. After hearings, United States District Judge Grooms of the Northern District of Alabama found that petitioners had been denied admission to the University "solely on account of their race and color." Holding this &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*2&lt;/span&gt; denied petitioners equal protection of state laws, the court permanently enjoined respondent Adams, his agents, employees and others acting in concert with respondent "from denying the plaintiffs and others similarly situated the right to enroll in the University of Alabama and pursue courses of study thereat, solely on account of their race or color." 134 F. Supp. 235. Respondent's motion to suspend the injunction pending appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit was granted by the District Judge. A judge of that court denied a motion to vacate the suspension and reinstate the injunction. A similar motion is now before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motion is granted and the injunction is reinstated to the extent that it enjoins and restrains the respondent and others designated from denying these petitioners, Autherine Lucy and Polly Anne Myers, the right to enroll in the University of Alabama and pursue courses of study there. &lt;i&gt;Sipuel&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma,&lt;/i&gt; 332 U. S. 631; &lt;i&gt;Sweatt&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Painter,&lt;/i&gt; 339 U. S. 629; &lt;i&gt;McLaurin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education,&lt;/i&gt; 339 U. S. 637. In other respects, the motion is denied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided October 17, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jerome A. Duffy&lt;/i&gt; for petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PER CURIAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner applied to the United States District Court, Northern District of California, Southern Division, for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that his automatic appeal to the California Supreme Court from a conviction for a capital offense had been heard upon a fraudulently prepared transcript of the trial proceedings. The official court reporter had died before completing the transcription of his stenographic notes of the trial, and petitioner alleges that the prosecuting attorney and the substitute reporter selected by him had, by corrupt arrangement, prepared the fraudulent transcript. On the record before us, there is no denial of petitioner's allegations. The District Court, without issuing the writ or an order to show cause, dismissed the application as not stating a cause of action. 128 F. Supp. 600. The Court of Appeals affirmed the order of the District Court. 221 F. 2d 276. The charges of fraud as such set forth a denial of due process of law in violation of the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*4&lt;/span&gt; Fourteenth Amendment. See &lt;i&gt;Mooney&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Holohan,&lt;/i&gt; 294 U. S. 103. Without intimating any opinion regarding the validity of the claim, we hold that in the circumstances disclosed by the record before us the application should not have been summarily dismissed. Accordingly, the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court for a hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE REED, MR. JUSTICE BURTON, and MR. JUSTICE CLARK dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;D. K. McKamy&lt;/i&gt; served as Special Master by appointment of the Court, 346 U. S. 862.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gerard H. Brandon&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;James D. Thomas,&lt;/i&gt; Special Assistant Attorneys General, argued the cause for the State of Mississippi, plaintiff.

&lt;center&gt;Decided November 7, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Assistant Attorney General Holland&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, John F. Davis, Ellis N. Slack, Lee A. Jackson&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Harry Baum.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;John C. White&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE MINTON delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anderson, Clayton &amp;amp; Co., a Delaware corporation, was organized in 1929. Its capital structure consisted of preferred stock and 100,000 shares of common stock, the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*56&lt;/span&gt; capital value of which was fixed at one dollar per share. By April 21, 1930, all of the common stock had been issued, in varying amounts, to the corporation's managing officials, in consideration of their worth and responsibility to the company, which is engaged in the highly technical and skilled business of cotton merchandising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1931 a written agreement was entered into between the corporation and the common stockholders, the purpose of which was to restrict the ownership of the common stock to the management group and to adjust the respective interests in the common stock among that group as responsibility changed. Accordingly, the agreement provided that the stock could not be disposed of except by written consent of the owners of 75% of the common stock. Upon the death of any party to the agreement, the corporation agreed to purchase the common stock of the deceased at its book value as of July 31 preceding the stockholder's death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One M. D. Anderson, one of the chief officers of the company, was originally issued 31,000 shares. During the development of the corporation, Mr. Anderson had transferred shares of his stock, pursuant to the agreement, to junior officials as they assumed more duties and responsibilities, until at the time of his death in 1939 he owned 18,574 shares. These shares the corporation purchased at their book value of $50.79 per share. This stock was not retired, but was retained as treasury stock. While in the treasury, it could not be voted nor were dividends paid on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company in 1944 sold 6,500 of these shares to junior officials at the then book value of $112.68 per share. The difference between the price paid Anderson's estate and that received from the sale of the shares to the junior officials was $402,285, on which the United States imposed a long-term capital-gains tax of $100,571.25. Respondent paid the tax and sued in the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*57&lt;/span&gt; Court of Claims to recover the amount. The respondent took the position that no long-term capital gain resulted because it was not dealing in its stock "as it might in the shares of another corporation," as contemplated in Treasury Regulations 111, &#167; 29.22 (a)-15.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The Court of Claims agreed with respondent and entered judgment for recovery of the tax paid, with interest. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;129&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ct. Cl.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;295&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 122 F. Supp. 837. We granted certiorari, 348 U. S. 936, because of the claim of conflict with decisions of the Courts of Appeals.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sole question therefore is whether, in the circumstances of this case, Treasury Regulations 111, &#167; 29.22 (a)-15 makes the sale of this treasury stock of the corporation &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*58&lt;/span&gt; a taxable transaction under &#167; 22 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 66 of Treasury Regulations 74, promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1928, provided that a corporation which purchases its own stock, holds it as treasury stock, and later sells it "realizes no gain or loss" from such transactions. This Court upheld that regulation as a proper one interpretive of the general terms of &#167; 22 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code. &lt;i&gt;Helvering&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Reynolds Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 306 U. S. 110, 114. The present regulation was promulgated in 1934. Its effect was to remove the categorical exclusion of taxable gains or losses arising out of the purchase and sale by a corporation of its own stock accorded such transactions by Article 66 of Treasury Regulations 74. The amended regulation specifically excludes from tax consequences a corporation's sale of its stock upon original issue whether sold for more or less than par or stated value. On the other hand, the regulation specifically provides that tax consequences flow from the receipt by the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*59&lt;/span&gt; corporation of its own stock as consideration for sales of its property or in satisfaction of indebtedness to it. With regard to all other dealings by a corporation in its own stock, whether or not tax consequences result depends generally upon the "real nature of the transaction, which is to be ascertained from all its facts and circumstances." The regulation provides further that "if a corporation deals in its own shares as it might in the shares of another corporation," such dealings are considered, for tax purposes, as though the corporation were in fact dealing in the other corporation's stock. Thus, whether the transaction here in question is taxable depends, in the final analysis, on whether respondent corporation dealt with its shares of treasury stock "as it might" have dealt with another corporation's stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Claims ruled, after a thorough examination of all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction, that the corporation was not dealing in its shares as it might in the shares of another corporation. This conclusion is abundantly supported by the subsidiary findings, which are all supported by the evidence in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We agree with the Court of Claims. Here the purchase and sale were made pursuant to a contract entered into without any shown purpose of advantageous investment. Instead the purpose of the agreement was found to be to maintain the distribution of the stock among responsible and active members of the organization in a manner designed to reflect their worth to the corporation. Indicative of this singleness of purpose is the fact that some of the stock purchased from Mr. Anderson's estate was sold to the corporation's other executives at a price below that for which it was acquired. No consideration was given to the opportune time for purchase or sale. The purchase of Mr. Anderson's stock by the corporation was dictated by the terms of the contract upon the fortuitous &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*60&lt;/span&gt; circumstance of his death. Moreover, when purchased, the stock was lodged in the treasury. It could not be taken into account in any payment of dividends, nor voted in shareholder meetings, nor counted for the purpose of establishing a quorum. These unrecognized rights are all incident to the ownership of common stock of other corporations. It is thus clear that respondent was not dealing in its shares as it might in the shares of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government urges that the crucial inquiry as to whether the transaction is taxable under the regulation depends for its answer upon whether the reacquired shares are resold or retired and new shares issued; since the shares were not retired, the resale at a price greater than cost results in a taxable gain under &#167; 22 (a) of the Code and the applicable regulation. The Government receives comfort for its position in the language of &lt;i&gt;Commissioner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Batten, Barton, Durstine &amp;amp; Osborn, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 171 F. 2d 474, 476, and &lt;i&gt;Commissioner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Landers Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 210 F. 2d 188, 191. But we do not think formalities should be raised to such an important position. Moreover, the applicable regulation provides that tax consequences depend upon "the real nature of the transaction, which is to be ascertained from all its facts and circumstances," and not upon the sole circumstance that the stock is not retired. When viewed in its entirety, the instant transaction, limited to a wholly intracorporate purpose with no element of speculation or gain envisioned from dealing in its shares, does not constitute dealing by the corporation in its own shares as it might deal in the shares of another corporation within the meaning of the regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE BURTON dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  "SEC. 29.22 (a)-15. &lt;i&gt;Acquisition or Disposition by a Corporation of its Own Capital Stock.&lt;/i&gt; (a) Whether the acquisition or disposition by a corporation of shares of its own capital stock gives rise to taxable gain or deductible loss depends upon the real nature of the transaction, which is to be ascertained from all its facts and circumstances. The receipt by a corporation of the subscription price of shares of its capital stock upon their original issuance gives rise to neither taxable gain nor deductible loss, whether the subscription or issue price be in excess of, or less than, the par or stated value of such stock.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(b) But if a corporation deals in its own shares as it might in the shares of another corporation, the resulting gain or loss is to be computed in the same manner as though the corporation were dealing in the shares of another. So also if the corporation receives its own stocks as consideration upon the sale of property by it, or in satisfaction of indebtedness to it, the gain or loss resulting is to be computed in the same manner as though the payment had been made in any other property. Any gain derived from such transactions is subject to tax, and any loss sustained is allowable as a deduction where permitted by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  &lt;i&gt;Commissioner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Landers Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 210 F. 2d 188; &lt;i&gt;Commissioner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;H. W. Porter &amp;amp; Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 187 F. 2d 939; &lt;i&gt;Commissioner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rollins Burdick Hunter Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 174 F. 2d 698; &lt;i&gt;Commissioner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Batten, Barton, Durstine &amp;amp; Osborn, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 171 F. 2d 474.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  "SEC. 22. Gross Income.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(a) &lt;i&gt;General Definition.&lt;/i&gt; `Gross income' includes gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service (including personal service as an officer or employee of a State, or any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing), of whatever kind and in whatever form paid, or from professions, vocations, trades, businesses, commerce, or sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal, growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such property; also from interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever. . . ."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For tax years after 1953, transactions such as the one here involved carry no tax consequences by virtue of congressional enactment of &#167; 1032 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, which provides: "No gain or loss shall be recognized to a corporation on the receipt of money or other property in exchange for stock (including treasury stock) of such corporation."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Decided November 21, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
ON REHEARING.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Richard B. Montgomery&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Cicero C. Sessions.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lester S. Jayson&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Burger&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Paul A. Sweeney.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affirmed by an equally divided Court April 11, 1955.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners brought suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, seeking &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*62&lt;/span&gt; recovery under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1346 (b), for damages alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the Coast Guard in the operation of a lighthouse light. They alleged that on October 1, 1951, the tug &lt;i&gt;Navajo,&lt;/i&gt; owned by petitioner Indian Towing Company, was towing &lt;i&gt;Barge AS-16,&lt;/i&gt; chartered by petitioner Upper Mississippi Towing Corporation; that the barge was loaded with a cargo of triple super phosphate, consigned to petitioner Minnesota Farm Bureau Service Company and insured by petitioner United Firemen's Insurance Company; that the tug &lt;i&gt;Navajo&lt;/i&gt; went aground on Chandeleur Island and as a result thereof sea water wetted and damaged the cargo to the extent of $62,659.70; that the consignee refused to accept the cargo; that petitioners Indian Towing Company and Upper Mississippi Towing Corporation therefore became responsible for the loss of the cargo; and that the loss was paid by petitioner United Firemen's Insurance Company under loan receipts. The complaint further stated that the grounding of the &lt;i&gt;Navajo&lt;/i&gt; was due solely to the failure of the light on Chandeleur Island which in turn was caused by the negligence of the Coast Guard. The specific acts of negligence relied on were the failure of the responsible Coast Guard personnel to check the battery and sun relay system which operated the light; the failure of the Chief Petty Officer who checked the lighthouse on September 7, 1951, to make a proper examination of the connections which were "out in the weather"; the failure to check the light between September 7 and October 1, 1951; and the failure to repair the light or give warning that the light was not operating. Petitioners also alleged that there was a loose connection which could have been discovered upon proper inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On motion of the respondent the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, New Orleans Division. Respondent &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*63&lt;/span&gt; then moved to dismiss on the ground that it had not consented to be sued "in the manner in which this suit is brought" in that petitioners' only relief was under the Suits in Admiralty Act, 41 Stat. 525, or the Public Vessels Act, 43 Stat. 1112. This motion was granted and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed &lt;i&gt;per curiam.&lt;/i&gt; 211 F. 2d 886. Because the case presented an important aspect of the still undetermined extent of the Government's liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act, we granted certiorari, 348 U. S. 810. The judgment of the Court of Appeals was affirmed by an equally divided Court, 349 U. S. 902, but a petition for rehearing was granted, the earlier judgment in this Court vacated, and the case restored to the docket for reargument before the full Bench. 349 U. S. 926.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relevant provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act are 28 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 1346 (b), 2674, and 2680 (a):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#167; 1346 (b). ". . . the district courts . . . shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the United States, for money damages, accruing on and after January 1, 1945, for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#167; 2674. "The United States shall be liable . . . in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, but shall not be liable for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;.....&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*64&lt;/span&gt; &#167; 2680. "The provisions of this chapter and section 1346 (b) of this title shall not apply to&#151;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the Government, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute or regulation, whether or not such statute or regulation be valid, or based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is one of liability for negligence at what this Court has characterized the "operational level" of governmental activity. &lt;i&gt;Dalehite&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 346 U. S. 15, 42. The Government concedes that the exception of &#167; 2680 relieving from liability for negligent "exercise of judgment" (which is the way the Government paraphrases a "discretionary function" in &#167; 2680 (a)) is not involved here, and it does not deny that the Federal Tort Claims Act does provide for liability in some situations on the "operational level" of its activity. But the Government contends that the language of &#167; 2674 (and the implications of &#167; 2680) imposing liability "in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances . . ." must be read as excluding liability in the performance of activities which private persons do not perform. Thus, there would be no liability for negligent performance of "uniquely governmental functions." The Government reads the statute as if it imposed liability to the same extent as would be imposed on a private individual "under the same circumstances." But the statutory language is "under like circumstances," and it is hornbook tort law that one who undertakes to warn the public of danger and thereby &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*65&lt;/span&gt; induces reliance must perform his "good Samaritan" task in a careful manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Government in effect reads the statute as imposing liability in the same manner as if it were a municipal corporation and not as if it were a private person, and it would thus push the courts into the "non-governmental"-"governmental" quagmire that has long plagued the law of municipal corporations. A comparative study of the cases in the forty-eight States will disclose an irreconcilable conflict. More than that, the decisions in each of the States are disharmonious and disclose the inevitable chaos when courts try to apply a rule of law that is inherently unsound. The fact of the matter is that the theory whereby municipalities are made amenable to liability is an endeavor, however awkward and contradictory, to escape from the basic historical doctrine of sovereign immunity. The Federal Tort Claims Act cuts the ground from under that doctrine; it is not self-defeating by covertly embedding the casuistries of municipal liability for torts.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*66&lt;/span&gt; While the Government disavows a blanket exemption from liability for all official conduct furthering the "uniquely governmental" activity in any way, it does claim that there can be no recovery based on the negligent performance of the activity itself, the so-called "end-objective" of the particular governmental activity. Let us suppose that the Chief Petty Officer going in a Coast Guard car to inspect the light on Chandeleur Island first negligently ran over a pedestrian; later, while he was inspecting the light, he negligently tripped over a wire and injured someone else; he then forgot to inspect an outside connection and that night the patently defective connection broke and the light failed, causing a ship to go aground and its cargo of triple super phosphate to get wet; finally the Chief Petty Officer on his way out of the lighthouse touched a key to an uninsulated wire to see that it was carrying current, and the spark he produced caused a fire which sank a nearby barge carrying triple super phosphate. Under the Government's theory, some of these acts of negligence would be actionable, and some would not. But is there a rational ground, one that would carry conviction to minds not in the grip of technical obscurities, why there should be any difference in result? The acts were different in time and place but all were done in furtherance of the officer's task of inspecting the lighthouse and in furtherance of the Coast Guard's task in operating a light on Chandeleur Island. Moreover, if the United States were to permit the operation of private lighthouses&#151;not at all inconceivable&#151;the Government's basis of differentiation would be gone and the negligence charged in this case would be actionable. Yet there would be no change in the character of the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*67&lt;/span&gt; Government's activity in the places where it operated a lighthouse, and we would be attributing bizarre motives to Congress were we to hold that it was predicating liability on such a completely fortuitous circumstance&#151;the presence or absence of identical private activity.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the area of liability is circumscribed by certain provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act, see 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2680, all Government activity is inescapably "uniquely governmental" in that it is performed by the Government. In a case in which the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, a wholly Government-owned enterprise, was sought to be held liable on a crop-insurance policy on the theory that a private insurance company would be liable in the same situation, this Court stated: "Government is not partly public or partly private, depending upon the governmental &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*68&lt;/span&gt; pedigree of the type of a particular activity or the manner in which the Government conducts it." &lt;i&gt;Federal Crop Insurance Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Merrill,&lt;/i&gt; 332 U. S. 380, 383-384. On the other hand, it is hard to think of any governmental activity on the "operational level," our present concern, which is "uniquely governmental," in the sense that its kind has not at one time or another been, or could not conceivably be, privately performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing in the Tort Claims Act which shows that Congress intended to draw distinctions so finespun and capricious as to be almost incapable of being held in the mind for adequate formulation. The statute was the product of nearly thirty years of congressional consideration and was drawn with numerous substantive limitations and administrative safeguards. (For substantive limitations, see &#167; 2680 (a)-(m).&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; For administrative safeguards, see &#167; 2401 (b) (statute of limitations); &#167; 2402 (denial of trial by jury); &#167; 2672 (administrative adjustment of claims of $1,000 or less); &#167; 2673 (reports to Congress); &#167; 2674 (no liability for punitive damages or for interest prior to judgment); &#167; 2675 (disposition by federal agency as prerequisite to suit when claim is filed); &#167; 2677 (compromise); &#167; 2679 (exclusiveness of remedy).) The language of the statute does not support the Government's argument. Loose general statements in the legislative history to which the Government points seem directed mainly toward the "discretionary function" exemption of &#167; 2680 and are not persuasive. The broad and just purpose which the statute was designed to effect was to compensate the victims of negligence in the conduct of governmental activities in circumstances like unto those in which a private person would be liable and not &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*69&lt;/span&gt; to leave just treatment to the caprice and legislative burden of individual private laws. Of course, when dealing with a statute subjecting the Government to liability for potentially great sums of money, this Court must not promote profligacy by careless construction. Neither should it as a self-constituted guardian of the Treasury import immunity back into a statute designed to limit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coast Guard need not undertake the lighthouse service. But once it exercised its discretion to operate a light on Chandeleur Island and engendered reliance on the guidance afforded by the light, it was obligated to use due care to make certain that the light was kept in good working order; and, if the light did become extinguished, then the Coast Guard was further obligated to use due care to discover this fact and to repair the light or give warning that it was not functioning. If the Coast Guard failed in its duty and damage was thereby caused to petitioners, the United States is liable under the Tort Claims Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit considered &lt;i&gt;Feres&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 340 U. S. 135, and &lt;i&gt;Dalehite&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 346 U. S. 15, controlling. Neither case is applicable. &lt;i&gt;Feres&lt;/i&gt; held only that "the Government is not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service. Without exception, the relationship of military personnel to the Government has been governed exclusively by federal law." 340 U. S., at 146. And see &lt;i&gt;Brooks&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 337 U. S. 49. The differences between this case and &lt;i&gt;Dalehite&lt;/i&gt; need not be labored. The governing factors in &lt;i&gt;Dalehite&lt;/i&gt; sufficiently emerge from the opinion in that case.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*70&lt;/span&gt; The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed and remanded.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE REED, with whom MR. JUSTICE BURTON, MR. JUSTICE CLARK, and MR. JUSTICE MINTON join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court reverses the judgment on the ground that the United States is liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for damages caused by the negligence of the Coast Guard in maintaining a lighthouse light near the mouth of the Mississippi. The alleged negligence was the failure of the Coast Guard personnel to check the electrical system which operated the light, the failure to make a proper examination of the connections and other apparatus connected with the light, and the failure to repair the light or give notice to vessels that the light was not functioning. Although navigators were warned this was an "unwatched light,"&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; it is assumed at this point in the litigation that this negligence occurred and that it was the proximate cause of the loss. Government operation of the lighthouse was authorized by 14 U. S. C. &#167; 81. It is forbidden to others except by authority of the Coast Guard.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*71&lt;/span&gt; The question of the liability of the United States for this negligence depends on the scope and meaning of the Federal Tort Claims Act. The history of the adoption of that Act has heretofore been thoroughly explained.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Before its enactment, the immunity of the Government from such tort actions was absolute. The Act authorized suits against the Government under certain conditions. The Government was made liable for injury to persons or property&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*72&lt;/span&gt; person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred." 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1346 (b).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a further condition, 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2674, that the United States should be liable "in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances."&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Feres&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 340 U. S. 135, we passed upon the applicability of the Act to claims by members of the armed services injured through the negligence of other military personnel.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; We said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"One obvious shortcoming in these claims is that plaintiffs can point to no liability of a `private individual' even remotely analogous to that which they are asserting against the United States. We know of no American law which ever has permitted a soldier to recover for negligence, against either his superior officers or the Government he is serving. Nor is there any liability `under like circumstances,' for no private individual has power to conscript or mobilize a private army with such authorities over persons as the Government vests in echelons of command.. . . In the usual civilian doctor and patient relationship, there is of course a liability for malpractice. And a landlord would undoubtedly be held liable if an injury occurred to a tenant as the result of a negligently maintained heating plant. But the liability assumed by the Government here is that created by `all the circumstances,' not that which a &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*73&lt;/span&gt; few of the circumstances might create. We find no parallel liability before, and we think no new one has been created by, this Act. Its effect is to waive immunity from recognized causes of action and was not to visit the Government with novel and unprecedented liabilities." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 141-142.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, in &lt;i&gt;Feres&lt;/i&gt; the Court was of the view that the Act does not create new causes of action therefore beyond the applicable law of torts. So, in determining whether an action for negligence in maintaining public lights is permissible, we must consider whether similar actions were allowed by the law of the place where the negligence occurred, prior to the Tort Claims Act, against public bodies otherwise subject to suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dalehite&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 346 U. S. 15, 42, followed the reasoning of &lt;i&gt;Feres.&lt;/i&gt; That case involved, among other issues, the liability of the United States for negligence of the Coast Guard in fighting fire. The Coast Guard had been found negligent in its fire-fighting duties by the trial court. These duties were outside the discretionary function exception of &#167; 2680 (a) of the Act. Resting our decision on the Act itself, we said the Tort Claims Act&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"did not change the normal rule that an alleged failure or carelessness of public firemen does not create private actionable rights. Our analysis of the question is determined by what was said in the &lt;i&gt;Feres&lt;/i&gt; case. See 28 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 1346 and 2674. The Act, as was there stated, limited United States liability to `the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.' 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2674. Here, as there, there is no analogous liability; in fact, if anything is doctrinally sanctified in the law of torts it is the immunity of communities and other public bodies for injuries due to fighting fire." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 43-44.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*74&lt;/span&gt; These two interpretive decisions have not caused Congress to amend the Federal Tort Claims Act. As a matter of fact, the catastrophe that gave rise to the &lt;i&gt;Dalehite&lt;/i&gt; case was subsequently presented to Congress for legislative relief by way of compensation for the losses which resulted, as found by the trial court, partly from the negligence of the Coast Guard. Throughout the reports, discussion and enactment of the relief act, there was no effort to modify the Tort Claims Act so as to change the law, in any respect, as interpreted by this Court in &lt;i&gt;Feres&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dalehite.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; Although its discussion was restricted solely to the discretionary function exception to the Act, Congress must have accepted the rulings relating to the issues here involved as in accord with its understanding of the Tort Claims Act. One cannot say that when a statute is interpreted by this Court we must follow that interpretation in subsequent cases unless Congress has amended the statute. On this our cases conflict.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; However, we should continue to hold, as a matter of &lt;i&gt;stare decisis&lt;/i&gt; and as the normal rule, that inaction of Congress, after a well-known and important decision of common knowledge, is "an aid in statutory construction . . . useful at times in resolving statutory ambiguities." &lt;i&gt;Helvering&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Reynolds,&lt;/i&gt; 313 U. S. 428, 432. The nonaction of Congress should decide this controversy in the light of the previous rulings. The reasons which led to the conclusions against creating new and novel liabilities in the &lt;i&gt;Feres&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dalehite&lt;/i&gt; cases retain their persuasiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*75&lt;/span&gt; This enactment, like any other, should be construed so as to accomplish its purpose, but not with extravagant generosity so as to make the Government liable in instances where no liability was intended by Congress. It is certainly not necessary that every word in a statute receive the broadest possible interpretation. If Congress intended to create liability for all incidents not theretofore actionable against suable public agencies, that intention should be made plain. The courts are not the legislative branch of the Government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Act made the Government liable in instances where it would be suable "if a private person." The meaning of "private person" is not discussed in the legislative history. In &lt;i&gt;Feres&lt;/i&gt; we talked of private liability and came to a conclusion which is contrary to that reached by the Court today. See pp. 72-73, &lt;i&gt;supra.&lt;/i&gt; We held that because surgeons in private practice or private landlords were liable for negligence did not mean the United States was. Liability of governments for the failure of lighthouse warning lights is as unknown to tort law as, for example, liability for negligence in fire fighting excluded by the &lt;i&gt;Dalehite&lt;/i&gt; ruling. Lighthouse keeping is as uniquely a governmental function as fire fighting. There is at least some uncertainty and ambiguity as to what Congress meant by making the United States liable in circumstances where it would be liable "if a private person." That uncertainty should not lead us to accept liability for the United States in this case. In dealing with this enlarged concept of federal liability for torts, wisdom should dictate a cautious approach along the lines of &lt;i&gt;Feres&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dalehite.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Act says that the United States shall be liable in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred. &#167; 1346 (b). This alleged tort occurred in Louisiana. Under the Louisiana law a municipal corporation is not responsible for injury sustained as &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*76&lt;/span&gt; a result of negligence on the part of the employees of a city in the maintenance of traffic lights.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; Street traffic lights are a close analogy to navigation lights. We can see no reason to doubt that under Louisiana law the maintenance of navigation lights, if permissible, by municipalities would likewise be free of liability. The Court warns us against the morass of decisions that involve municipal tort liability. It calls that law a "quagmire" and avoids it by a complete surrender of sovereign immunity without regard to the law of municipal liability of the respective States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The over-all impression from the majority opinion is that it makes the Government liable under the Act for negligence in the conduct of "any governmental activity on the `operational level.' " It seems broad enough to cover all so-called "uniquely governmental activities." Logically it may cover negligence in fire fighting, although the &lt;i&gt;Dalehite&lt;/i&gt; holding on that point is not overruled.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; Perhaps liability arises even for injuries from negligence in pursuing criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court's literal interpretation of this Act brings about an application of the Federal Tort Claims Act analogous to that condemned by Congress in the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 after &lt;i&gt;Anderson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mt. Clemens Pottery Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 328 U. S. 680, see 61 Stat. 84, &#167; 1 (a), and in the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1949, 63 Stat. 910, after &lt;i&gt;Bay Ridge Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Aaron,&lt;/i&gt; 334 U. S. 446, see 2 U. S. Code Cong. Serv. (1949) 1617. Compare &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Trucking Assns.,&lt;/i&gt; 310 U. S. 534. The judgment should be affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  A good illustration of the effort of a conscientious court to reconcile the irreconcilable is &lt;i&gt;Haley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;City of Boston,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;191&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Mass.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;291&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 77 N. E. 888. For an example of the confusion prevailing in one jurisdiction, compare &lt;i&gt;District of Columbia&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Woodbury,&lt;/i&gt; 136 U. S. 450 (municipal corporation liable for injuries caused by negligent failure to keep sidewalk in repair) with &lt;i&gt;Harris&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;District of Columbia,&lt;/i&gt; 256 U. S. 650 (municipal corporation not liable for injuries caused by negligent sprinkling of streets). But even in the law of municipal corporation and state liability, one State at least has sought to emerge from the quagmire. See the more recent New York cases: &lt;i&gt;Foley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State of New York,&lt;/i&gt; 294 N. Y. 275, 62 N. E. 2d 69 (State liable when negligent failure to replaced burned-out bulb in traffic light caused accident); &lt;i&gt;Bernardine&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;City of New York,&lt;/i&gt; 294 N. Y. 361, 62 N. E. 2d 604 (city liable in negligence action for damages caused by runaway police horse). When the confused law of municipal corporations is applied to the Tort Claims Act, the same unsatisfactory results occur. Compare the holding of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in the instant case, 211 F. 2d 886, with its holding in &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lawter,&lt;/i&gt; 219 F. 2d 559 (United States liable under Tort Claims Act for negligence of Coast Guard during helicopter rescue operation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Although the argument is more elaborately presented here, this is not the first statute which the Government has attempted to construe in this manner. The Suits in Admiralty Act, 41 Stat. 525, provided that a libel &lt;i&gt;in personam&lt;/i&gt; could be brought against the United States for damage caused by a Government-owned merchant vessel or tug in cases "where if such vessel were privately owned or operated . . . a proceeding in admiralty could be maintained . . ." and stated that "such suits shall proceed and shall be heard and determined according to the principles of law and to the rules of practice obtaining in like cases between private parties." In &lt;i&gt;Eastern Transportation Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 272 U. S. 675, an action was brought under the Act to recover damages for the loss of a ship and cargo by collision with an unmarked wreck of a sunken Government-owned merchant vessel. The Government moved to dismiss the action on the ground, &lt;i&gt;inter alia,&lt;/i&gt; that "The said alleged cause of action set out in the said libel relates to an alleged failure on the part of the officers and/or agents of the United States to perform a purely governmental function or to alleged negligence of such officers and/or agents in the performance of a purely governmental function; and gives rise to no liability on the part of the United States of America for which they are suable in the United States Court or elsewhere." The motion to dismiss was granted on another ground but on appeal the Supreme Court rejected all arguments that the district court lacked jurisdiction and reversed the judgment of the district court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Congress significantly withheld liability for claims relating, &lt;i&gt;inter alia,&lt;/i&gt; to the postal service, tax collection, quarantine establishment, fiscal operations, combatant activities of the Coast Guard during time of war, and the activities of the TVA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  The Court in &lt;i&gt;Dalehite&lt;/i&gt; disposed of a claim of liability for negligence in connection with fire fighting by finding that "there is no analogous liability . . ." in the law of torts. 346 U. S., at 44. But see &lt;i&gt;Workman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York City,&lt;/i&gt; 179 U. S. 552.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No person, or public body, or instrumentality, excluding the armed services, shall establish, erect, or maintain any aid to maritime navigation without first obtaining authority to do so from the Coast Guard in accordance with applicable regulations.

Each day during which such violation continues shall be considered as a new offense."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sidney S. Alderman&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Henry L. Walker&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Frank G. Tompkins, Jr.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PER CURIAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals without reaching the constitutional challenge to that court's jurisdiction to review the denial by the trial court of a motion for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was excessive. Even assuming such appellate power to exist under the Seventh Amendment, we find that the Court of Appeals was not justified, on this record, in regarding the denial of a new trial, upon a remittitur of part of the verdict, as an abuse of discretion. For apart from that question, as we view the evidence we think that the action of the trial court was not without support in the record, and accordingly that its action should not have been disturbed by the Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*78&lt;/span&gt; We need not consider respondent's contention that only the jurisdictional question was presented by the petition for certiorari, for in reversing on the above ground we follow the traditional practice of this Court of refusing to decide constitutional questions when the record discloses other grounds of decision, whether or not they have been properly raised before us by the parties.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Harry F. Murphy&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;John V. Lindsay&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. On the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Charles F. Barber, Beatrice Rosenberg&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Isabelle R. Cappello.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affronti was tried in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri on a ten-count indictment charging him with illegal sales of narcotics. A jury found him guilty on counts two through ten, and a five-year sentence was imposed on each count to be served consecutively. At the time of sentencing, execution of the sentences on counts six through ten was suspended and probation granted, the probation to commence at the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*80&lt;/span&gt; expiration of the sentences on counts two through five. While serving his sentence on count two, petitioner filed a motion in the District Court seeking suspension of sentence and probation on counts three, four and five. The motion was denied upon the controlling authority of &lt;i&gt;Phillips&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 212 F. 2d 327 (C. A. 8th Cir. 1954), which held that the district courts have no power to suspend sentence after a prisoner has begun to serve a cumulative sentence composed of two or more consecutive sentences. The Court of Appeals affirmed,&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; and we granted certiorari&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; because of the existence of a conflict between the decision below and the decision of the Ninth Circuit in &lt;i&gt;Kirk&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 185 F. 2d 185.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to 1925 the district courts had no power at all to suspend sentences and release a convict on probation. &lt;i&gt;Ex parte United States,&lt;/i&gt; 242 U. S. 27. This situation was remedied by Congress when it passed the Probation Act in 1925.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; That Act gave power to the federal courts, "after conviction or after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere," to suspend sentence and place the defendant on probation.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; The purpose of the Act, as revealed by its legislative history, was discussed by this Court in &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Murray,&lt;/i&gt; 275 U. S. 347. That case also presented a question concerning the time within which a district court can suspend a sentence and grant probation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*81&lt;/span&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Murray&lt;/i&gt; this Court observed that, in view of the existence of provisions for parole and executive clemency, it would seem unlikely that Congress would have intended to make the probation provisions applicable during the same period of time. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 356. It was concluded that it would be more reasonable to construe the Probation Act so as to reconcile the three methods of mitigation of criminal sentences, thereby "making them as little of a repetition as we can." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 357. This and other considerations led the Court to hold that a district judge had no power under the Act to place a convict on probation after he had begun the execution of his sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision in the &lt;i&gt;Murray&lt;/i&gt; case does not, however, completely dispose of the question now before the Court. Since the &lt;i&gt;Murray&lt;/i&gt; decision there has been a language change in the statutory provisions for probation. In &lt;i&gt;Murray&lt;/i&gt; the Court was considering the question of power of the district courts to place a convict on probation after he had commenced to serve a single general sentence.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; Here we are concerned with the power to grant suspension of sentences which are, technically, wholly unexecuted because they constitute the unserved terms of a series of consecutive sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1948, in connection with the revision and codification of Title 18 of the United States Code, the language of the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*82&lt;/span&gt; Probation Act with which we are concerned was changed. The statute now provides for suspension of sentence and probation "Upon entering a judgment of conviction."&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; The substitution of the quoted words for "after conviction or after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere," the phrase which appeared in the Probation Act prior to the 1948 codification of Title 18, does not appear to have resulted in any substantive change in the law. The Reviser's Notes which accompanied the 1948 codification merely stated the following with respect to this amendment: "Words `after conviction or after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere for any crime or offense not punishable by death or life imprisonment' were omitted from first sentence as unnecessary."&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; The Reviser's Notes were used by Congress as a full explanation of all changes made in the text of the existing law.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; It is unlikely, therefore, that Congress intended the phrase as it appears in the present section to have a different meaning than the phrase had prior to the revision.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more significant difference between the &lt;i&gt;Murray&lt;/i&gt; case and the present one is the fact that here we are dealing with a cumulative sentence composed of a number of distinct sentences which are to run consecutively.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; Petitioner notes that while he has begun the execution of the first of the series of sentences, he has not commenced the execution of the sentences which he is now seeking to have suspended. He reasons from this fact that the District Court still has probationary power over the latter sentences. Of course the words of the statute do not themselves require adoption of petitioner's argument. In fact the language of the present probation provision, and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*83&lt;/span&gt; of the original provision as interpreted by &lt;i&gt;Murray,&lt;/i&gt; suggests a contrary result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final analysis, this case must be governed by the meaning of the statute. Are we to read the statute to mean that the courts should be able to suspend the uncommenced terms of a cumulative sentence after the prisoner has been imprisoned and entered upon the execution of a prior term? We think not. The &lt;i&gt;Murray&lt;/i&gt; opinion points out that it is unlikely that Congress would have found it wise to make probation apply in such a way as to unnecessarily overlap the parole and executive-clemency provisions of the law. Federal judicial power to permit probation springs solely from legislative action. &lt;i&gt;Ex parte United States, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; The authority to put a convict on probation for an uncommenced term, after service of an earlier term has begun, has not been clearly given. Therefore, in construing the provisions for probation, we adhere to the &lt;i&gt;Murray&lt;/i&gt; interpretation to avoid interference with the parole and clemency powers vested in the Executive Branch.&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt; We conclude that the probationary power ceases with respect to all of the sentences composing a single cumulative sentence immediately upon imprisonment for any part of the cumulative sentence.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*84&lt;/span&gt; We note the argument that since Congress has authorized the sentencing court to limit probation to less than all of the terms of a cumulative sentence,&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; it should follow that the probation powers for each term exist until that term is begun. But the power to limit a grant of probation to less than an entire cumulative sentence does not compel a conclusion that the power to grant probation as to each of the separate sentences exists until the convict begins to serve each. We think, moreover, this argument is met by our conclusion that the provisions for probation should be interpreted to avoid, so far as possible, duplicating other existing provisions for the mitigation of criminal sentences. See note 12, &lt;i&gt;supra.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress has done nothing since this Court's decision in &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Murray, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; to indicate that probation power should be applied after the beginning of any term of a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[3]  The Fourth Circuit appears to be in accord with the Eighth Circuit on this question. &lt;i&gt;Mann&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 218 F. 2d 936. The Tenth Circuit, &lt;i&gt;obiter dictum,&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;White&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Steigleder,&lt;/i&gt; 37 F. 2d 858, 859, is in accord with the Ninth Circuit. See also &lt;i&gt;Kelley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 209 F. 2d 638.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  43 Stat. 1259.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  The power extended to sentences for convictions of any offense not punishable by death or life imprisonment, and the exercise of the power was discretionary and conditioned upon the ends of justice and the best interests of the public and the defendant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  The &lt;i&gt;Murray&lt;/i&gt; decision embraced two cases consolidated for argument. In one of the cases the District Court had suspended a three-month prison sentence and placed the convict (Murray) on probation one day after he had commenced serving the sentence. In the other case the prisoner (Cook) had been sentenced to "a total of fourteen years and nine months" imprisonment, and the District Court suspended the remainder of his sentence and placed him on probation after he had served approximately two years of the sentence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether Cook's sentence was in fact a cumulative sentence of a number of consecutive sentences (see &lt;i&gt;Phillips&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 212 F. 2d 327, 332) is unimportant at this time. His sentence was treated as if it had been a single general sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10]  See &lt;i&gt;Kirk&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 185 F. 2d 185, 188.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[11]  See note 6, &lt;i&gt;supra.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[12]  That a contrary construction would result in an unnecessary overlap between probation and parole provisions is made clear by a reference to 18 U. S. C. &#167; 4202. That section provides that a federal prisoner may be paroled after he has served one-third of the "term or terms" for which he is confined. Thus, if serving a cumulative sentence composed of two or more consecutive sentences, a prisoner is eligible for parole when he has served one-third of the total sentence. See also 18 U. S. C. &#167; 4161, which provides that "When two or more consecutive sentences are to be served, the aggregate of the several sentences shall be the basis" for computing time off for good behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[13]  This conclusion as to the meaning of the statute is further supported by a recognition of some of the practicalities of sentencing. At the time of entering a judgment of conviction, the district judge is in the best position to fix the terms of a convict's sentence. Thereafter, however, the judge becomes progressively less familiar with the considerations material to the adjustment of the punishment to fit the criminal. At the same time, the officials of the Executive Branch responsible for these matters become progressively better qualified to make the proper adjustments. Cf. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Soeder,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/uyx/united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;120&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;594&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 597; &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bernett,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/mdd/af4o/united-states-v-bernett/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;123&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;841&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 846. These considerations apply as much to a series of consecutive sentences as to a simple general sentence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But see Note, Application of Federal Probation to Convicts Serving Consecutive Sentences, 64 Yale L. J. 260, 265-268 (1954).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[14]  18 U. S. C. &#167; 3651. The provision for probation "limited to one or more counts or indictments" was added by the 1948 codification of Title 18. The Reviser's Notes indicate that this provision was added because it "reflects exactly the practice followed by the Federal courts." H. R. Rep. No. 304, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., App. A173. Thus, this addition did not result in a substantive change in the Probation Act and does not of itself reveal any extension thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Decided December 12, 1955.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*108&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;David P. Findling&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Sobeloff, Theophil C. Kammholz&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dominick L. Manoli.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;John Wesley Weekes&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 7, 1952, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit entered its decree enforcing in full an order of the National Labor Relations Board issued on June 30, 1950, against respondent herein directing it (1) to cease and desist from refusing to bargain collectively with District Lodge No. 46, International Association of Machinists, a labor union, as the exclusive bargaining agent of all its tool and die makers, machinists, etc., and from discouraging membership in the union; (2) to take affirmative action upon request to bargain collectively with the union as the exclusive representative of respondent's said employees and, if an understanding should be reached, to embody such understanding in a signed agreement; and (3) to post at its plant a notice to be furnished by the Regional Director of the National Labor Relations Board and signed by the officers of respondent agreeing to desist from certain unfair labor practices, and to bargain collectively with the union upon request as required in the order. 197 F. 2d 814.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent had posted the notice and restored certain employees to their jobs as required by the order, but declined to bargain collectively with the union, although requested by the latter to do so on numerous occasions over a period of seven months, basing its refusal to do so on the ground that the union had lost its alleged majority status by reason of a turnover in personnel. It demanded proof from the union that it represented a majority of the employees then employed in the bargaining unit. The &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*109&lt;/span&gt; union replied that its majority status had been determined by the Board and by the Court of Appeals in its decree of enforcement. Respondent never bargained collectively with the union, either before or after the decree, contending at all times that the latter did not have majority status, although in 1948 the employees had designated the union as their bargaining agent and the Board had found that respondent had avoided collective bargaining through its lack of good faith and because of its own unfair labor practices. This finding was not challenged by respondent and was adopted by the Court of Appeals in its enforcement decree of August 7, 1952. Respondent then filed a petition with the Board on January 27, 1953, requesting an election in the bargaining unit. Because of respondent's failure to remedy its unfair labor practice by good-faith bargaining with the union for a reasonable period, the Board sustained its Regional Director's dismissal of the petition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 22, 1953, the Board filed its petition in the Court of Appeals, specifically setting forth the conduct of respondent showing its failure and refusal to comply with the court's decree enforcing the Board's order, and asking that respondent be required to show cause why it should not be adjudged in civil contempt. The Board also asked the court to institute a prosecution for criminal contempt against respondent. Respondent answered, claiming compliance with the decree except that since the decree of the court it had refused to bargain collectively with the union as the bargaining agent of its employees because for a long time the union had not represented its employees as such bargaining agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals concluded that no case for a civil contempt order had been made out and dismissed the proceeding. The court held that, notwithstanding the prior entry of a decree directing respondent to bargain collectively with the union, respondent's compliance with &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*110&lt;/span&gt; other provisions of the decree entitled it to refuse to bargain collectively since it had ascertained that even before the decree, because of a turnover in personnel, the union had lost majority status. The court stated that to hold respondent liable in contempt under these circumstances would do violence to its decree and to the Act rather than to vindicate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the importance of the question in the administration of the National Labor Relations Act, we granted certiorari, 348 U. S. 958. Petitioner does not press here its prayer in the court below for an adjudication of criminal contempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In arriving at its decision purging respondent of contempt, the Court of Appeals stated that respondent had "complied fully with all the provisions" of its enforcement order; that it had "made an offer to bargain with the union;" that the union's alleged loss of majority status was "without fault" on the respondent's part; and that the Board took the position that respondent was required "to bargain indefinitely" notwithstanding the union's loss of majority status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we had so understood the record, certiorari would not have been granted, but we do not so understand it. We believe the facts are to the contrary in each instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original order of the Board found not only that respondent for a period of four years after notification by the union of its majority status had refused to bargain with it, but had also used deliberate and flagrant unfair labor practices to deprive the union of its majority status. In its opinion enforcing this cease and desist order, the Court of Appeals stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"With commendable candor respondent's counsel has stated its position as follows:&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;" `We have controverted the findings of fact of the Board in our Response, but in all fairness to this &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*111&lt;/span&gt; Court we are constrained to admit that there is sufficient evidence, even though disputed, upon which to base the Board's order.' " 197 F. 2d 814.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings of both the Board and the Court of Appeals are, therefore, clear that there had been no willingness on respondent's part up to that date, August 7, 1952, to bargain with the union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its "Answer of the Respondent to the petition of the Board for adjudication in Civil Contempt and other Civil Relief," filed November 12, 1953, respondent alleged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"As shown hereinbefore and hereinafter Respondent has refused to bargain collectively with the Union because it did not represent a majority of the employees."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing in the record to indicate that this situation has ever changed in the slightest respect, and this in face of the fact that the union has at all times been willing to bargain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither does the record indicate that the Board insisted upon respondent's bargaining with the union indefinitely; on the contrary, it demonstrates that the Board has urged here and in the court below that respondent should bargain in good faith only for a reasonable length of time after designation of the union as the bargaining agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It cannot be said that respondent is "without fault," because the record is clear that at no time has respondent bargained in good faith with the union. It has met with the union but twice since 1948 and on neither of those occasions did it bargain.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; It has avoided other meetings &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*112&lt;/span&gt; by evasion and refusal or failure to respond to a request therefor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sole question necessary for determination here is whether an employer who has been found guilty by the Board of unfair labor practices in refusing to bargain with a union designated as the exclusive representative of its employees and who has been directed to so bargain, is, after a decree enforcing the order and without remedying its unfair labor practices, legally justified in refusing to bargain with the union because it contends the union does not in fact have majority status in its plant, or must such employer bargain fairly for a reasonable length of time in accordance with the order to avoid an adjudication in civil contempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that an employer in such circumstances cannot lawfully refuse to bargain; that he must do so for a reasonable time; and that for a failure to so bargain it is the statutory duty of the Court of Appeals on petition of the Board to adjudge him in contempt of its enforcement decree. To conclude otherwise would greatly weaken the administration of the National Labor Relations Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Act contemplates cooperation between the Board and the Courts of Appeals both at the enforcement and the contempt stages in order to effectuate its purposes. It consigns certain statutory functions to each,&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; and where the Board has acted properly within its designated sphere, the court is required to grant enforcement of the Board's order.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; The decree, like the order it enforces, is aimed at the prevention of unfair labor practices, an objective of the Act, and so long as compliance is not forthcoming that objective is frustrated. It is for this reason that Congress gave the judicial remedy of contempt &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*113&lt;/span&gt; as the ultimate sanction to secure compliance with Board orders.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; The granting or withholding of such remedial action is not wholly discretionary with the court.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; This is true not only under the National Labor Relations Act but also under general principles of equity jurisprudence.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems clear to us that in the light of these principles and the facts of this case, the court below exceeded the allowable limits of its discretion in denying relief to the Board and that its judgment must be reversed and remanded for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed and remanded.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  There was only one meeting after entry of the enforcement decree. At this meeting, on January 19, 1953, respondent stated that it was in doubt as to the majority status of the union and for that reason "hesitated" to bargain with the union on the matter of a contract. This position was confirmed in a letter dated January 20, 1953, in which respondent advised the union of its intention to petition the Board for a decertification election.&lt;/p&gt;
