&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued October 12, 1999.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Question certified November 30, 1999.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided January 9, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's response to the certified question, supplemental briefs were filed by &lt;i&gt;James Brandon Lieber&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Harold Gondelman,&lt;/i&gt; for petitioner, and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*226&lt;/span&gt; by &lt;i&gt;D. Michael Fisher,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General of Pennsylvania, &lt;i&gt;Robert A. Graci,&lt;/i&gt; Assistant Executive Deputy Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;Andrea F. McKenna,&lt;/i&gt; Senior Deputy Attorney General, for respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per Curiam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner, William Fiore, was convicted of violating a Pennsylvania statute prohibiting the operation of a hazardous waste facility without a permit. After Fiore's conviction became final, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court interpreted the statute for the first time, and made clear that Fiore's conduct was not within its scope. However, the Pennsylvania courts refused to grant Fiore collateral relief. We granted certiorari in part to decide when, or whether, the Federal Due Process Clause requires a State to apply a new interpretation of a state criminal statute retroactively to cases on collateral review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to determine if that question was in fact presented, we asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court whether its decision interpreting the statute not to apply to conduct like Fiore's was a new interpretation, or whether it was, instead, a correct statement of the law when Fiore's conviction became final. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, responding to our certified question, has now made clear that retroactivity is not at issue. At the same time, that court's interpretation of its statute makes clear that Fiore did not violate the statute. We consequently find that his conviction is not consistent with the demands of the Federal Due Process Clause. See &lt;i&gt;Jackson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Virginia,&lt;/i&gt; 443 U. S. 307, 316 (1979).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case, previously described in greater detail in our opinion certifying the state-law question to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, 528 U. S. 23 (1999), arises out of William Fiore's conviction under a Pennsylvania statute that prohibits "operat[ing] a hazardous waste" facility without a "permit." &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*227&lt;/span&gt; Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 35, &#167; 6018.401(a) (Purdon 1993); see &lt;i&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fiore,&lt;/i&gt; CC No. 8508740 (Ct. Common Pleas, Allegheny Cty., Pa., Jan. 19, 1988), App. 6. The Commonwealth conceded that Fiore in fact had a permit, but argued that Fiore had deviated so dramatically from the permit's terms that he nonetheless had violated the statute. And the Commonwealth's lower courts agreed. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 43-44; &lt;i&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fiore,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;391&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Pa. Super.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;634&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 563 A. 2d 189 (1989) (affirming Fiore's conviction on the trial court's reasoning).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to review Fiore's case, &lt;i&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fiore,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;525&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Pa.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;577&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 575 A. 2d 109 (1990), and his conviction became final. Thereafter, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed to review the conviction of Fiore's co-defendant, David Scarpone, convicted of the same crime at the same time. The Supreme Court reversed Scarpone's conviction on the ground that the statute meant what it said: The statute made it unlawful to operate a facility &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; a permit; one who deviated from his permit's terms was not a person &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; a permit; hence, a person who deviated from his permit's terms did not violate the statute. &lt;i&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Scarpone,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/pa/cQi3/com-v-scarpone/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;535&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Pa.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;273&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 279, 634 A. 2d 1109, 1112 (1993) (describing the Commonwealth's interpretation as "a bald fiction we cannot endorse").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiore, unsuccessful in his subsequent state-court attempts to have his own conviction set aside, see &lt;i&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fiore,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/pasuperct/c7xS/com-v-fiore/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;445&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Pa. Super.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;401&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 665 A. 2d 1185 (1995), appeal denied, &lt;i&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fiore,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;544&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Pa.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;623&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 675 A. 2d 1243 (1996), brought a federal habeas corpus action. The District Court granted the writ, but the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. 149 F. 3d 221 (1998). The Court of Appeals believed that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in Scarpone's case, had announced a new rule of law, inapplicable to Fiore's already final conviction. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 227. And, the Court of Appeals said, "state courts are under no [federal] constitutional obligation to apply their decisions retroactively." &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*228&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 222. We granted certiorari to determine whether Fiore's conviction was inconsistent with the Due Process Clause. 526 U. S. 1038 (1999).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we were uncertain whether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in Scarpone's case represented a change in the law of Pennsylvania, we certified the following question to that court:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Does the interpretation of Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 35, &#167; 6018.401(a) (Purdon 1993), set forth in &lt;i&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Scarpone,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/pa/cQi3/com-v-scarpone/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;535&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Pa.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;273&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 279, 634 A. 2d 1109, 1112 (1993), state the correct interpretation of the law of Pennsylvania at the date Fiore's conviction became final?" 528 U. S., at 29.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We received the following reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"&lt;i&gt;Scarpone&lt;/i&gt; did not announce a new rule of law. Our ruling merely clarified the plain language of the statute. . . . Our interpretation of [&#167; 6018.401(a)] in &lt;i&gt;Scarpone&lt;/i&gt; furnishes the proper statement of law at the date Fiore's conviction became final." &lt;i&gt;Fiore&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;White,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/Bb1/fiore-v-white/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;562&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Pa.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;634&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 646, 757 A. 2d 842, 848-849 (2000) (citation omitted).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's reply specifies that the interpretation of &#167; 6018.401(a) set out in &lt;i&gt;Scarpone&lt;/i&gt; "merely clarified" the statute and was the law of Pennsylvania&#151;as properly interpreted&#151;at the time of Fiore's conviction. Because &lt;i&gt;Scarpone&lt;/i&gt; was not new law, this case presents no issue of retroactivity. Rather, the question is simply whether Pennsylvania can, consistently with the Federal Due Process Clause, convict Fiore for conduct that its criminal statute, as properly interpreted, does not prohibit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Court's precedents make clear that Fiore's conviction and continued incarceration on this charge violate due process. We have held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*229&lt;/span&gt; Amendment forbids a State to convict a person of a crime without proving the elements of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt. See &lt;i&gt;Jackson,&lt;/i&gt; 443 U. S., at 316; &lt;i&gt;In re Winship,&lt;/i&gt; 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970). In this case, failure to possess a permit is a basic element of the crime of which Fiore was convicted. &lt;i&gt;Scarpone, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 279, 634 A. 2d, at 1112. And the parties agree that the Commonwealth presented no evidence whatsoever to prove that basic element. To the contrary, the Commonwealth, conceding that Fiore did possess a permit, see Brief for Respondents 1, necessarily concedes that it did not prove he failed to possess one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple, inevitable conclusion is that Fiore's conviction fails to satisfy the Federal Constitution's demands. We therefore reverse the contrary judgment of the Third Circuit and remand this case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;So ordered.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*199&lt;/span&gt; Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Michael L. Waldman&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed briefs for petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Robinson, Matthew D. Roberts,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Joel M. Gershowitz.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Kennedy, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue presented rests upon the initial assumption, which we accept for analytic purposes, that the trial court &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*200&lt;/span&gt; erred in a Sentencing Guidelines determination after petitioner's conviction of a federal offense. The legal error, petitioner alleges, increased his prison sentence by at least 6 months and perhaps by 21 months. We must decide whether this would be "prejudice" under &lt;i&gt;Strickland&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Washington,&lt;/i&gt; 466 U. S. 668 (1984). The Government is not ready to concede error in the sentencing determination but now acknowledges that if an increased prison term did flow from an error the petitioner has established &lt;i&gt;Strickland&lt;/i&gt; prejudice. In agreement with the Government and petitioner on this point, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980's and early 1990's, petitioner Paul Glover was the Vice President and General Counsel of the Chicago Truck Drivers, Helpers, and Warehouse Workers Union (Independent). The evidence showed Glover used his control over the union's investments to enrich himself and his co-conspirators through kickbacks. When the malfeasance was discovered, he was tried in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. His first trial ended when the jury could not agree, but a second jury convicted him. The presentence investigation report prepared by the probation office recommended that the convictions for labor racketeering, money laundering, and tax evasion be grouped together under United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual &#167; 3D1.2 (Nov. 1994), which allows the grouping of "counts involving substantially the same harm." The Government, insisting that the money laundering counts could not be grouped with the other counts, objected to that recommendation, and the District Court held a hearing on the matter. The money laundering counts, it ruled, should not be grouped with Glover's other offenses. The ruling, as the trial court viewed it, was in conformance with decisions in those Courts of Appeals which had refused to group money laundering counts with other counts for various reasons. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*201&lt;/span&gt; See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lombardi,&lt;/i&gt; 5 F. 3d 568 (CA1 1993); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Porter,&lt;/i&gt; 909 F. 2d 789 (CA4 1990); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Taylor,&lt;/i&gt; 984 F. 2d 298 (CA9 1993); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Johnson,&lt;/i&gt; 971 F. 2d 562 (CA10 1992); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Harper,&lt;/i&gt;  972 F. 2d 321 (CA11 1992). In the trial court, Glover's attorneys did not submit papers or offer extensive oral arguments contesting the no-grouping argument advanced by the Government. When the District Court decided not to group the money laundering counts with the other counts, Glover's offense level was increased by two levels, yielding a concomitant increase in the sentencing range. Glover was sentenced to 84 months in prison, which was in the middle of the Guidelines range of 78 to 97 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On appeal to the Seventh Circuit, Glover's counsel (the same attorneys who represented him in District Court) did not raise the grouping issue; instead, they concentrated on claims that certain testimony from his first trial should not have been admitted at his second trial and that he should not have been assessed a two-level increase for perjury at his first trial. A short time after argument on Glover's appeal, a different panel of the Seventh Circuit held that, under some circumstances, grouping of money laundering offenses with other counts was proper under &#167; 3D1.2. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Wilson,&lt;/i&gt; 98 F. 3d 281 (1996). A month and a half later, the Seventh Circuit rejected both of Glover's arguments and affirmed his conviction and sentence. 101 F. 3d 1183 (1996).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover filed a &lt;i&gt;pro se&lt;/i&gt; motion to correct his sentence under 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2255 (1994 ed., Supp. III). The failure of his counsel to press the grouping issue, he argued, was ineffective assistance, a position confirmed, in his view, by the Court of Appeals' decision in &lt;i&gt;Wilson.&lt;/i&gt; The performance of counsel, he contended, fell below a reasonable standard both at sentencing, when his attorneys did not with any clarity or force contest the Government's argument, and on appeal, when they did not present the issue in their briefs or call the &lt;i&gt;Wilson&lt;/i&gt; decision to the panel's attention following the oral &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*202&lt;/span&gt; argument. He further argued that absent the ineffective assistance, his offense level would have been two levels lower, yielding a Guidelines sentencing range of 63 to 78 months. Under this theory, the 84-month sentence he received was an unlawful increase of anywhere between 6 and 21 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Court denied Glover's motion, determining that under Seventh Circuit precedent an increase of 6 to 21 months in a defendant's sentence was not significant enough to amount to prejudice for purposes of &lt;i&gt;Strickland&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Washington, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; As a result, the District Court did not decide the issue whether the performance of Glover's counsel fell below a reasonable standard of competence. On appeal to the Seventh Circuit, the Government argued only that Glover had not suffered prejudice within the meaning of &lt;i&gt;Strickland.&lt;/i&gt; See App. to Reply Brief for Petitioner 1a&#151;22a. Citing &lt;i&gt;Durrive&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 4 F. 3d 548 (CA7 1993), the Government contended that even were the performance of Glover's counsel ineffective, the resulting additional 6 to 21 months, under the law as established in the Seventh Circuit, would not constitute prejudice. App. to Reply Brief for Petitioner 21a. The Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on that theory. 182 F. 3d 921 (1999) (table). We granted Glover's petition for certiorari. 530 U. S. 1261 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government no longer puts forth the proposition that a 6- to 21-month prison term increase is not prejudice under &lt;i&gt;Strickland.&lt;/i&gt; It now acknowledges that such a rule, without more, would be "inconsistent with this Court's cases and unworkable." Brief for United States 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears the Seventh Circuit drew the substance of its no-prejudice rule from our opinion in &lt;i&gt;Lockhart&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fretwell,&lt;/i&gt;  506 U. S. 364 (1993). &lt;i&gt;Lockhart&lt;/i&gt; holds that in some circumstances a mere difference in outcome will not suffice to establish prejudice. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 369. The Seventh Circuit extracted from this holding the rule at issue here, which denies relief &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*203&lt;/span&gt; when the increase in sentence is said to be not so significant as to render the outcome of sentencing unreliable or fundamentally unfair. See &lt;i&gt;Durrive, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 550-551. The Court explained last Term that our holding in &lt;i&gt;Lockhart&lt;/i&gt; does not supplant the &lt;i&gt;Strickland&lt;/i&gt; analysis. See &lt;i&gt;Williams&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Taylor,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S. 362, 393 (2000) ("Cases such as &lt;i&gt;Nix&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Whiteside,&lt;/i&gt; 475 U. S. 157 (1986), and &lt;i&gt;Lockhart&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fretwell,&lt;/i&gt; 506 U. S. 364 (1993), do not justify a departure from a straightforward application of &lt;i&gt;Strickland&lt;/i&gt; when the ineffectiveness of counsel &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; deprive the defendant of a substantive or procedural right to which the law entitles him"); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 414 (opinion of O'Connor, J.) ("As I explained in my concurring opinion in &lt;i&gt;[Lockhart],&lt;/i&gt; `in the vast majority of cases . . . [t]he determinative question&#151;whether there is "a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different"&#151;remains unchanged' "). The Seventh Circuit was incorrect to rely on &lt;i&gt;Lockhart&lt;/i&gt; to deny relief to persons attacking their sentence who might show deficient performance in counsel's failure to object to an error of law affecting the calculation of a sentence because the sentence increase does not meet some baseline standard of prejudice. Authority does not suggest that a minimal amount of additional time in prison cannot constitute prejudice. Quite to the contrary, our jurisprudence suggests that any amount of actual jail time has Sixth Amendment significance. Compare &lt;i&gt;Argersinger&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hamlin,&lt;/i&gt;  407 U. S. 25 (1972) (holding that the assistance of counsel must be provided when a defendant is tried for a crime that results in a sentence of imprisonment), with &lt;i&gt;Scott&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Illinois,&lt;/i&gt;  440 U. S. 367 (1979) (holding that a criminal defendant has no Sixth Amendment right to counsel when his trial does not result in a sentence of imprisonment). Our decisions on the right to jury trial in a criminal case do not suggest that there is no prejudice in the circumstances here. Those cases have limited the right to jury trial to offenses where the potential punishment was imprisonment for six months or more. See &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*204&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Argersinger, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 29 (citing &lt;i&gt;Duncan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Louisiana,&lt;/i&gt; 391 U. S. 145 (1968)). But they do not control the question whether a showing of prejudice, in the context of a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, requires a significant increase in a term of imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seventh Circuit's rule is not well considered in any event, because there is no obvious dividing line by which to measure how much longer a sentence must be for the increase to constitute substantial prejudice. Indeed, it is not even clear if the relevant increase is to be measured in absolute terms or by some fraction of the total authorized sentence. See &lt;i&gt;Martin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 109 F. 3d 1177, 1183 (CA7 1996) (Rovner, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). Although the amount by which a defendant's sentence is increased by a particular decision may be a factor to consider in determining whether counsel's performance in failing to argue the point constitutes ineffective assistance, under a determinate system of constrained discretion such as the Sentencing Guidelines it cannot serve as a bar to a showing of prejudice. Compare &lt;i&gt;Spriggs&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Collins,&lt;/i&gt; 993 F. 2d 85, 88 (CA5 1993) (requiring a showing that a sentence would have been "&lt;i&gt;significantly&lt;/i&gt; less harsh" under the Texas discretionary sentencing scheme), with &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Phillips,&lt;/i&gt;  210 F. 3d 345 (CA5 2000) (finding prejudice under the Sentencing Guidelines when an error by counsel led to an increased sentence). We hold that the Seventh Circuit erred in engrafting this additional requirement onto the prejudice branch of the &lt;i&gt;Strickland&lt;/i&gt; test. This is not a case where trial strategies, in retrospect, might be criticized for leading to a harsher sentence. Here we consider the sentencing calculation itself, a calculation resulting from a ruling which, if it had been error, would have been correctable on appeal. We express no opinion on the ultimate merits of Glover's claim because the question of deficient performance is not before us, but it is clear that prejudice flowed from the asserted error in sentencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*205&lt;/span&gt; III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government makes various arguments for alternative grounds to affirm the Court of Appeals. Among other contentions, the Government suggests that the failure of Glover's counsel to argue for grouping of the money laundering counts was not deficient; that Glover's grouping claim has no legal merit in any event; and that even if Glover had prevailed on his grouping claim, his sentence in fact would have increased as a result. Glover disputes these contentions. We need not describe the arguments in great detail, because despite the fact the parties have joined issue at least in part on these points, they were neither raised in nor passed upon by the Court of Appeals. In the ordinary course we do not decide questions neither raised nor resolved below. See &lt;i&gt;Taylor&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Freeland &amp;amp; Kronz,&lt;/i&gt; 503 U. S. 638, 646 (1992). As a general rule, furthermore, we do not decide issues outside the questions presented by the petition for certiorari. This Court's Rule 14.1(a). Whether these issues remain open, and if so whether they have merit, are questions for the Court of Appeals or the District Court to consider and determine in the first instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Seventh Circuit is reversed. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*207&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*208&lt;/span&gt; Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Stevens, O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined. Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 220.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Darrell D. Hallett&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;John M. Colvin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Robert J. Chicoine.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kent L. Jones&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Acting Assistant Attorney General Junghans, Deputy Solicitor General Wallace, Teresa E. McLaughlin,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Edward T. Perelmuter.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Thomas, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed tax deficiencies against petitioners David and Louise Gitlitz and Philip and Eleanor Winn because they used nontaxed discharge of indebtedness to increase their bases in S corporation stock and to deduct suspended losses. In this case we must answer two questions. First, we must decide whether the Internal Revenue Code (Code) permits taxpayers to increase bases in their S corporation stock by the amount of an corporation's discharge of indebtedness excluded from gross income. And, second, if the Code permits such an increase, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*209&lt;/span&gt; we must decide whether the increase occurs before or after taxpayers are required to reduce the S corporation's tax attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Gitlitz and Philip Winn&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; were shareholders of P. D. W. &amp;amp; A., Inc., a corporation that had elected to be taxed under Subchapter S of the Code, 26 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 1361-1379 (1994 ed. and Supp. III). Subchapter S allows shareholders of qualified corporations to elect a "pass-through" taxation system under which income is subjected to only one level of taxation. See &lt;i&gt;Bufferd&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 506 U. S. 523, 525 (1993). The corporation's profits pass through directly to its shareholders on a pro rata basis and are reported on the shareholders' individual tax returns. See &#167; 1366(a)(1)(A).&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; To prevent double taxation of income upon distribution from the corporation to the shareholders, &#167; 1367(a)(1)(A) permits shareholders to increase their corporate bases by items of income identified in &#167; 1366(a) (1994 ed. and Supp. III). Corporate losses and deductions are passed through in a similar manner, see &#167; 1366(a)(1)(A), and the shareholders' bases in the corporation's stock and debt are decreased accordingly, see &#167;&#167; 1367(a)(2)(B), 1367(b)(2)(A). However, a shareholder cannot take corporate losses and deductions into account on his personal tax return to the extent that such items exceed his basis in the stock and debt of the S corporation. See &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*210&lt;/span&gt; &#167; 1366(d)(1) (Supp. III). If those items exceed the basis, the excess is "suspended" until the shareholder's basis becomes large enough to permit the deduction. See &#167;&#167; 1366(d)(1), (2) (1994 ed. and Supp. III).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1991, P. D. W. &amp;amp; A. realized $2,021,296 of discharged indebtedness. At the time, the corporation was insolvent in the amount of $2,181,748. Because it was insolvent even after the discharge of indebtedness was added to its balance sheet, P. D. W. &amp;amp; A. excluded the entire discharge of indebtedness amount from gross income under 26 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 108(a) and 108(d)(7)(A). On their tax returns, Gitlitz and Winn increased their bases in P. D. W. &amp;amp; A. stock by their pro rata share (50 percent each) of the amount of the corporation's discharge of indebtedness. Petitioners' theory was that the discharge of indebtedness was an "item of income" subject to pass-through under &#167; 1366(a)(1)(A). They used their increased bases to deduct on their personal tax returns corporate losses and deductions, including losses and deductions from previous years that had been suspended under &#167; 1366(d). Gitlitz and Winn each had losses (including suspended losses and operating losses) that totaled $1,010,648. With the upward basis adjustments of $1,010,648 each, Gitlitz and Winn were each able to deduct the full amount of their pro rata share of P. D. W. &amp;amp; A.'s losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commissioner determined that petitioners could not use P. D. W. &amp;amp; A.'s discharge of indebtedness to increase their bases in the stock and denied petitioners' loss deductions. Petitioners petitioned the Tax Court to review the deficiency determinations. The Tax Court, in its initial opinion, granted relief to petitioners and held that the discharge of indebtedness was an "item of income" and therefore could support a basis increase. See &lt;i&gt;Winn&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 73 TCM 3167 (1997), &#182; 97,286 RIA Memo withdrawn and reissued, 75 TCM 1840 (1998), &#182; 98,071 RIA Memo TC. In light of the Tax Court's decision in &lt;i&gt;Nelson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commis-&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*211&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;sioner,&lt;/i&gt; 110 T. C. 114 (1998), aff'd, 182 F. 3d 1152 (CA10 1999),&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; however, the Tax Court granted the Commissioner's motion for reconsideration and held that shareholders may not use an S corporation's untaxed discharge of indebtedness to increase their bases in corporate stock. See &lt;i&gt;Winn&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 75 TCM 1840 (1998), &#182; 98,071 RIA Memo TC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals affirmed. See 182 F. 3d 1143 (CA10 1999). It assumed that excluded discharge of indebtedness is an item of income subject to pass-through to shareholders pursuant to &#167; 1366(a)(1)(A), &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1148, 1151, n. 7, but held that the discharge of indebtedness amount first had to be used to reduce certain tax attributes of the S corporation under &#167; 108(b), and that only the leftover amount could be used to increase basis.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; The Court of Appeals explained that, because the tax attribute to be reduced (in this case the corporation's net operating loss) was equal to the amount of discharged debt, the entire amount of discharged debt was absorbed by the reduction at the corporate level,and nothing remained of the discharge of indebtedness to be passed through to the shareholders under &#167; 1366(a)(1)(A). &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1151. Because Courts of Appeals have disagreed on how to treat discharge of indebtedness of an insolvent S corporation, compare &lt;i&gt;Gaudiano&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 216 F. 3d 524, 535 (CA6 2000) (holding that tax attributes are reduced before excluded discharged debt income is passed through to shareholders), cert. pending, No. 00-459; &lt;i&gt;Witzel&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 200 F. 3d 496, 498 (CA7 2000) (same), cert. pending, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*212&lt;/span&gt; No. 99-1693; and 182 F. 3d, at 1150 (case below), with &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Farley,&lt;/i&gt; 202 F. 3d 198, 206 (CA3 2000) (holding that excluded discharged debt income is passed through to shareholders before tax attributes are reduced), cert. pending, No. 99-1675 [Reporter's Note: See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 1111]; see also &lt;i&gt;Pugh&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 213 F. 3d 1324, 1330 (CA11 2000) (holding that excluded discharged debt income is subject to pass-through and can increase basis), cert. pending, No. 00-242, we granted certiorari. 529 U. S. 1097 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we can reach the issue addressed by the Court of Appeals&#151;whether the increase in the taxpayers' corporate bases occurs before or after the taxpayers are required to reduce the S corporation's tax attributes&#151;we must address the argument raised by the Commissioner.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; The Commissioner argues that the discharge of indebtedness of an insolvent S corporation is not an "item of income" and thus never passes through to shareholders. Under a plain reading of the statute, we reject this argument and conclude that excluded discharged debt is indeed an "item of income," which passes through to the shareholders and increases their bases in the stock of the S corporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*213&lt;/span&gt; Section 61(a)(12) states that discharge of indebtedness generally is included in gross income. Section 108(a)(1) provides an express exception to this general rule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Gross income does not include any amount which (but for this subsection) would be includible in gross income by reason of the discharge . . . of indebtedness of the taxpayer if&#151;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(B) the discharge occurs when the taxpayer is insolvent."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commissioner contends that this exclusion from gross income alters the character of the discharge of indebtedness so that it is no longer an "item of income." However, the text and structure of the statute do not support the Commissioner's theory. Section 108(a) simply does not say that discharge of indebtedness ceases to be an &lt;i&gt;item of income&lt;/i&gt; when the S corporation is insolvent. Instead it provides only that discharge of indebtedness ceases to be &lt;i&gt;included in gross income.&lt;/i&gt; Not all items of income are included in gross income, see &#167; 1366(a)(1) (providing that "items of income," including "tax-exempt" income, are passed through to shareholders), so mere exclusion of an amount from gross income does not imply that the amount ceases to be an item of income. Moreover, &#167;&#167; 101 through 136 employ the same construction to exclude various items from gross income: "Gross income does not include . . . ." The consequence of reading this language in the manner suggested by the Commissioner would be to exempt all items in these sections from passthrough under &#167; 1366. However, not even the Commissioner encourages us to reach this sweeping conclusion. Instead the Commissioner asserts that discharge of indebtedness is unique among the types of items excluded from gross income because no economic outlay is required of the taxpayer receiving &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*214&lt;/span&gt; discharge of indebtedness. But the Commissioner is unable to identify language in the statute that makes this distinction relevant, and we certainly find none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, the statute makes clear that &#167; 108(a)'s exclusion does not alter the character of discharge of indebtedness as an item of income. Specifically, &#167; 108(e)(1) reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Except as otherwise provided in this section, there shall be no insolvency exception from the general rule that gross income includes income from the discharge of indebtedness."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This provision presumes that discharge of indebtedness is always "income," and that the only question for purposes of &#167; 108 is whether it is includible in gross income. If discharge of indebtedness of insolvent entities were not actually "income," there would be no need to provide an exception to its inclusion in gross income; quite simply, if discharge of indebtedness of an insolvent entity were not "income," it would necessarily not be included in gross income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the plain language of the statute, the Commissioner argues, generally, that excluded discharge of indebtedness is not income and, specifically, that it is not "tax-exempt income" under &#167; 1366(a)(1)(A).&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; First, the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*215&lt;/span&gt; Commissioner argues that &#167; 108 merely codified the "judicial insolvency exception," and that, under this exception, discharge of indebtedness of an insolvent taxpayer was not considered income. The insolvency exception was a rule that the discharge of indebtedness of an insolvent taxpayer was not taxable income. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dallas Transfer &amp;amp; Terminal Warehouse Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 70 F. 2d 95 (CA5 1934); &lt;i&gt;Astoria Marine Construction Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 12 T. C. 798 (1949). But the exception has since been limited by &#167; 108(e). Section 108(e) precludes us from relying on any understanding of the judicial insolvency exception that was not codified in &#167; 108. And as explained above, the language and logic of &#167; 108 clearly establish that, although discharge of indebtedness of an insolvent taxpayer is not included in gross income, it is nevertheless income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commissioner also relies on a Treasury Regulation to support his theory that no income is realized from the discharge of the debt of an insolvent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Proceedings under Bankruptcy Act.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(1) Income is not realized by a taxpayer by virtue of the discharge, under section 14 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U. S. C. 32), of his indebtedness as the result of an adjudication in bankruptcy, or by virtue of an agreement among his creditors not consummated under any provision of the Bankruptcy Act, if immediately thereafter the taxpayer's liabilities exceed the value of his assets." 26 CFR &#167; 1.61-12(b) (2000).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if this regulation could be read (counter textually) to apply outside the bankruptcy context, it merely states that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*216&lt;/span&gt; "[i]ncome is not &lt;i&gt;realized.&lt;/i&gt; " The regulation says nothing about whether discharge of indebtedness is income subject to pass-through under &#167; 1366.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the Commissioner argues that excluded discharge of indebtedness is not " tax-exempt" income under &#167; 1366(a)(1)(A), but rather "tax-deferred" income. According to the Commissioner, because the taxpayer is required to reduce tax attributes that could have provided future tax benefits, the taxpayer will pay taxes on future income that otherwise would have been absorbed by the forfeited tax attributes. Implicit in the Commissioner's labeling of such income as "tax-deferred," however, is the erroneous assumption that &#167; 1366(a)(1)(A) does not include "tax-deferred" income. Section 1366 applies to "items of income." This section expressly includes "tax-exempt" income, but this inclusion does not mean that the statute must therefore exclude "tax-deferred" income. The section is worded broadly enough to include any item of income, even tax-deferred income, that "could affect the liability for tax of any shareholder." &#167; 1366(a)(1)(A). Thus, none of the Commissioner's contentions alters our conclusion that discharge of indebtedness of an insolvent S corporation is an item of income for purposes of &#167; 1366(a)(1)(A).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having concluded that excluded discharge of indebtedness is an "item of income" and is therefore subject to passthrough to shareholders under &#167; 1366, we must resolve the sequencing question addressed by the Court of Appeals&#151; whether pass-through is performed before or after the reduction of the S corporation's tax attributes under &#167; 108(b). Section 108(b)(1) provides that "[t]he amount excluded from gross income under [&#167; 108(a)] shall be applied to reduce the tax attributes of the taxpayer as provided [in this section]." Section 108(b)(2) then lists the various tax attributes to be reduced in the order of reduction. The first tax attribute to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*217&lt;/span&gt; be reduced, and the one at issue in this case, is the net operating loss. See &#167; 108(b)(2)(A). Section 108(d)(7)(B) specifies that, for purposes of attribute reduction, the shareholders' suspended losses for the taxable year of discharge are to be treated as the S corporation's net operating loss. If tax attribute reduction is performed &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; the discharge of indebtedness is passed through to the shareholders (as the Court of Appeals held), the shareholders' losses that exceed basis are treated as the corporation's net operating loss and are then reduced by the amount of the discharged debt. In this case, no suspended losses would remain that would permit petitioners to take deductions.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; If, however, attribute reduction is performed &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the discharged debt income is passed through (as petitioners argue), then the shareholders would be able to deduct their losses (up to the amount of the increase in basis caused by the discharged debt). Any suspended losses remaining then will be treated as the S corporation's net operating loss and will be reduced by the amount of the discharged debt. Therefore, the sequence of the steps of pass-through and attribute reduction determines whether petitioners here were deficient when they increased their bases by the discharged debt amount and deducted their losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*218&lt;/span&gt; The sequencing question is expressly addressed in the statute. Section 108(b)(4)(A) directs that the attribute reductions "shall be made &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the determination of the &lt;i&gt;tax imposed&lt;/i&gt; by this chapter for the taxable year of the discharge." (Emphases added.) See also &#167; 1017(a) (applying the same sequencing when &#167; 108 attribute reduction affects basis of corporate property). In order to determine the "tax imposed," an S corporation shareholder must adjust his basis in his corporate stock and pass through all items of income and loss. See &#167;&#167; 1366, 1367 (1994 ed. and Supp. III). Consequently, the attribute reduction must be made &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt;  the basis adjustment and pass-through. In the case of petitioners, they must pass through the discharged debt, increase corporate bases, and then deduct their losses, all before any attribute reduction could occur. Because their basis increase is equal to their losses, petitioners have no suspended losses remaining. They, therefore, have no net operating losses to reduce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Commissioner has now abandoned the reasoning of the Court of Appeals below,&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; we address the primary &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*219&lt;/span&gt; arguments made in the Courts of Appeals against petitioners' reading of the sequencing provision. First, one court has expressed the concern that, if the discharge of indebtedness is passed through to the shareholder &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; the tax attributes are reduced, then there can never be any discharge of indebtedness remaining "at the corporate level," &#167; 108(d)(7)(A), by which to reduce tax attributes.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gaudiano,&lt;/i&gt; 216 F. 3d, at 533. This concern presumes that tax attributes can be reduced only if the discharge of indebtedness itself remains at the corporate level. The statute, however, does not impose this restriction. Section 108(b)(1) requires only that the tax attributes be reduced by "[t]he &lt;i&gt;amount&lt;/i&gt;  excluded from gross income" (emphasis added), and that amount is not altered by the mere pass-through of the income to the shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, courts have discussed the policy concern that, if shareholders were permitted to pass through the discharge of indebtedness before reducing any tax attributes, the shareholders would wrongly experience a "double windfall": &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*220&lt;/span&gt; They would be exempted from paying taxes on the full amount of the discharge of indebtedness, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; they would be able to increase basis and deduct their previously suspended losses. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 182 F. 3d, at 1147-1148. Because the Code's plain text permits the taxpayers here to receive these benefits, we need not address this policy concern.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Breyer, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with the majority's reasoning with the exception of footnotes 6 and 10. The basic statutory provision before us is 26 U. S. C. &#167; 108&#151;the provision that excludes from the "gross income" of any "insolvent" taxpayer, income that cancellation of a debt (COD) would otherwise generate. As the majority acknowledges, however, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 214-215, n. 6, &#167; 108 contains a subsection that sets forth a special exception. The exception, entitled "Special rules for S corporation," says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*221&lt;/span&gt; "(A) Certain provisions to be applied at corporate level.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the case of an S corporation, subsections (a), (b), (c), and (g) shall be applied at the corporate level." 26 U. S. C. &#167; 108(d)(7)(A).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one reads this language literally as exclusive, both the COD exclusion (&#167; 108(a)) and the tax attribute reduction (&#167; 108(b)) would apply only "at the corporate level." Hence the COD income would not flow through to S corporation shareholders. Consequently, the insolvent S corporation's COD income would not increase the shareholder's basis and would not help the shareholder take otherwise unavailable deductions for suspended losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commissioner argues that we should read the language in this way as preventing the flow-through of the corporation's COD income. Brief for Respondent 27. He points to the language of a House Committee, which apparently thought, when Congress passed an amendment to &#167; 108, that the Commissioner's reading is correct. H. R. Rep. No. 103-111, pp. 624-625 (1993) ("[T]he exclusion and basis reduction are both made at the S corporation level (sec. 108(d)(7)). The shareholders' basis in their stock is not adjusted by the amount of debt discharge income that is excluded at the corporate level"). At least one commentator believes the same. See Loebl, Does the Excluded COD Income of an Insolvent S Corporation Increase the Basis of the Shareholders' Stock?, 52 U. Fla. L. Rev. 957, 981-988 (2000). But see Lockhart &amp;amp; Duffy, Tax Court Rules in &lt;i&gt;Nelson&lt;/i&gt; That S Corporation Excluded COD Income Does Not Increase Shareholder Stock Basis, 25 Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. 287 (1999).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commissioner finds support for his literal, exclusive reading of &#167; 108(d)(7)(A)'s language in the fact that his reading would close a significant tax loophole. That loophole&#151; preserved by the majority&#151;would grant a &lt;i&gt;solvent&lt;/i&gt; shareholder of an insolvent S corporation a tax benefit in the form of permission to take an otherwise unavailable deduction, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*222&lt;/span&gt; thereby sheltering other, unrelated income from tax. See &lt;i&gt;Witzel&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 200 F. 3d 496, 497 (CA7 2000) (Posner, C. J.) ("It is hard to understand the rationale for using a tax exemption to avoid taxation not only on the income covered by the exemption but also on unrelated income that is not tax exempt"). Moreover, the benefit often would increase in value as the amount of COD income increases, a result inconsistent with congressional intent to impose a "price" (attribute reduction), see Lipton, Different Courts Adopt Different Approaches to the Impact of COD Income on S Corporations, 92 J. Tax. 207 (2000), on excluded COD. Further, this deduction-related tax benefit would have very different tax consequences for identically situated taxpayers, depending only upon whether a single debt can be split into segments, each of which is canceled in a different year. For example, under the majority's interpretation, a $1 million debt canceled in one year would permit Taxpayer A to deduct $1 million of suspended losses in that year, thereby permitting A to shelter $1 million of unrelated income in that year. But because &#167; 108 reduces tax attributes after the first year, five annual cancellations of $200,000 will not create a $1 million shelter. Timing is all important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority acknowledges some of these policy concerns and confesses ignorance of any "other instance in which &#167; 108 directly benefits a solvent entity," but claims that its reading is mandated by the plain text of &#167; 108(d)(7)(A) and therefore that the Court may disregard the policy consequences. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 220, n. 10. It is difficult, however, to see why we should interpret that language as treating different solvent shareholders differently, given that the words "at the corporate level" were added "[i]n order to treat all shareholders in the same manner." H. R. Rep. No. 98-432, pt. 2, p. 1640 (1984). And it is more difficult to see why, given the fact that the "plain language" admits either interpretation, we should ignore the policy consequences. See &lt;i&gt;Commissioner&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Gillette Motor Transport, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 364 U. S. 130, 134-135 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*223&lt;/span&gt; (1960) (abandoning literal meaning of 26 U. S. C. &#167; 1221 (1958 ed.) for a reading more consistent with congressional intent). Accord, &lt;i&gt;Commissioner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;P. G. Lake, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 356 U. S. 260, 264&#151; 267 (1958); &lt;i&gt;Corn Products Refining Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 350 U. S. 46, 51-52 (1955); &lt;i&gt;Hort&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 313 U. S. 28, 30-31 (1941).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arguments from plain text on both sides here produce ambiguity, not certainty. And other things being equal, we should read ambiguous statutes as closing, not maintaining, tax loopholes. Such is an appropriate understanding of Congress' likely intent. Here, other things are equal, for, as far as I am aware, the Commissioner's literal interpretation of &#167; 108(d)(7)(A) as exclusive would neither cause any taxrelated harm nor create any statutory anomaly. Petitioners argue that it would create a linguistic inconsistency, for they point to a Treasury Regulation that says that the Commissioner will apply hobby loss limitations under &#167; 183 "at the corporate level in determining" allowable deductions, while, presumably, nonetheless permitting the deduction so limited to flow through to the shareholder. Treas. Reg. &#167; 1.183-1(f), 26 CFR &#167; 1.183-1(f) (2000). But we are concerned here with the "&lt;i&gt;application&lt;/i&gt; " of an exclusion, not with "&lt;i&gt;determining&lt;/i&gt; " the amount of a deduction. Regardless, the regulation's use of the words "at the corporate level," like the three other appearances of the formulation "applied" or "determined" "at the corporate level" in the Code, occur in contexts that are so very different from this one that nothing we say here need affect their interpretation. See 26 U. S. C. &#167; 49(a)(1)(E)(ii)(I) (determining whether financing is recourse financing); 26 U. S. C. &#167; 264(f)(5)(B) (1994 ed., Supp. III) (determining how to allocate interest expense to portions of insurance policies); 26 U. S. C. &#167; 302(e)(1)(A) (determining whether a stock distribution shall be treated as a partial liquidation). If there are other arguments militating in favor of the majority's interpretation, I have not found them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*224&lt;/span&gt; The majority, in footnote 6, says that the words "at the corporate level" in &#167; 108(d)(7)(A) apply to the exclusion of COD income from corporate income and to "tax attribute reduction," but do not "suspen[d] the operation of . . . ordinary pass-through rules" because &#167; 108(d)(7)(A) "does not state or imply that the debt discharge provisions shall apply &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; `at the corporate level.' " It is the majority, however, that should explain why it reads the provision as nonexclusive (where, as here, its interpretation of the Code results in the "practical equivalent of [a] double deduction," &lt;i&gt;Charles Ilfeld Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hernandez,&lt;/i&gt; 292 U. S. 62, 68 (1934)). See &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Skelly Oil Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 394 U. S. 678, 684 (1969) (requiring "clear declaration of intent by Congress" in such circumstances). I do not contend that &#167; 108(d)(7)(A) &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be read as having exclusive effect, only that, given the alternative, this interpretation provides the best reading of &#167; 108 as a whole. And I can find no "clear declaration of intent by Congress" to support the majority's contrary conclusion regarding &#167; 108(d)(7)(A)'s effect. It is that conclusion from which, for the reasons stated, I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   &lt;i&gt;Richard M. Lipton&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Theodore R. Bots&lt;/i&gt; filed a brief for the Real Estate Roundtable as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Each man filed a joint tax return with his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Section 1366(a)(1) provides: "In determining the tax under this chapter of a shareholder for the shareholder's taxable year in which the taxable year of the S corporation ends . .., there shall be taken into account the share holder's pro rata share of the corporation's&#151;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(A) items of income (including tax-exempt income), loss, deduction, or credit the separate treatment of which could affect the liability for tax of any shareholder . . . ."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  In &lt;i&gt;Nelson,&lt;/i&gt; the Tax Court held that excluded discharge of indebtedness does not pass through to an S corporation's shareholders because &#167; 108 is an exception to normal S corporation pass-through rules.Specifically, the court held that, because &#167; 108(d)(7)(A) requires that "subsections (a) [and (b) of &#167; 108] shall be applied at the corporate level" in the case of an S corporation, it precludes any pass-through of the discharge of indebtedness to the &lt;i&gt;shareholder&lt;/i&gt; level.See &lt;i&gt;Nelson,&lt;/i&gt; 110 T. C., at 121-124.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Section 108(b)(1) reads: "The amount excluded from gross income under [&#167; 108(a)(1)] shall be applied to reduce the tax attributes of the taxpayer . . . ."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  The Commissioner has altered his arguments throughout the course of this litigation.According to the Tax Court, during the first iteration of this case the Commissioner made several arguments but then settled on a "final" one&#151;that the discharge of indebtedness of the insolvent S corporation was not an "item of income," see 73 TCM 3167 (1997), &#182; 97,286 RIA Memo TC. In the Court of Appeals, the Commissioner argued instead that, because any pass-through of excluded discharge of indebtedness to petitioner stook place after any reduction of tax attribute sand by then the income would have been fully absorbed by the tax attributes, no discharged debt remained to flow through to petitioners.The Commissioner relegated to a footnote his argument that discharge of indebtedness is not an "item of income." See Brief for Appellee in Nos. 98-9009 and 98-9010 (CA10), p. 33, n. 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  The Commissioner also contends, as does the dissent, that because &#167; 108(d)(7)(A) mandates that the discharged debt amount be determined and applied to reduce tax attributes "at the corporate level," rather than at the shareholder level,the discharged debt, even if it is some type of income, simply cannot pass through to shareholders. In other words, the Commissioner contends that &#167; 108(d)(7)(A) excepts excluded discharged debt from the general pass-through provisions for S corporations. However, &#167; 108(d)(7)(A) merely directs that the exclusion from gross income and the tax attribute reduction be made at the corporate level. Section 108(d)(7)(A) does not state or imply that the debt discharge provisions shall apply &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; "at the corporate level." The very purpose of Subchapter S is to tax at the shareholder level, not the corporate level. Income is determined at the S corporation level, see &#167; 1363(b), not in order to tax the corporation, see &#167; 1363(a) (exempting an S corporation from income tax), but solely to pass through to the S corporation's shareholders the corporation's income. Thus, the controlling provision states that, in determining a shareholder's liability, "there shall be taken into account the shareholder's pro rata share of the corporation's . . . items of income (including tax-exempt income) . . . ." &#167; 1366(a)(1). Nothing in &#167; 108(d)(7)(A) suspends the operation of these ordinary pass-through rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  Under this scenario, the shareholders' losses would be reduced by the discharge of indebtedness. However, it is unclear precisely what would happen to the discharge of indebtedness. The Court of Appeals below stated that the discharged debt would be "absorbed" by the reduction to the extent of the net operating loss and that therefore only the excess excluded discharged debt would remain to pass through to the shareholders. 182 F. 3d 1143, 1149 (CA10 1999). In contrast, another Court of Appeals suggested, albeit in dictum, that the full amount of the discharge might still pass through to the shareholder and be used to increase basis; the discharged debt amount would reduce the net operating loss but would not be absorbed by it. &lt;i&gt;Witzel&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 200 F. 3d 496, 498 (CA7 2000). We need not resolve this issue because we conclude that the discharge of indebtedness passes through before any attribute reduction takes place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  The Commissioner has abandoned his argument related to the sequencing issue before this Court. This abandonment is particularly odd given that the sequencing issue predominated in the Commissioner's argument to the Court of Appeals. Notwithstanding the Commissioner's attempt at oral argument to distance himself from the reasoning of the Court of Appeals on this issue&#151;the Commissioner represented to us that the Court of Appeals developed its reading of the statute &lt;i&gt;sua sponte,&lt;/i&gt; Tr. of Oral Arg. 22-24, 27&#151;it is apparent from the Commissioner's brief in the Court of Appeals that the Commissioner &lt;i&gt;supplied&lt;/i&gt; the very sequencing theory that the Court of Appeals adopted. Compare, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Brief for Appellee in Nos. 98-9009 and 98-9010 (CA10), p. 28 ("First, the discharge of indebtedness income that is excluded under Section 108(a) at the corporate level is temporarily set aside and has no tax consequences . . . . Second, PDW &amp;amp; A computes its tax attributes, &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; taxpayers' suspended losses. Third, the excluded discharge of indebtness income is applied against and eliminates the suspended losses. Because the excluded income is applied against&#151;and offset by&#151;the suspended losses, no item of income flows through to taxpayers under Section 1366(a), and no upward basis adjustment is made under Section 1367(a)" (citations omitted)), with, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 182 F. 3d, at 1151 ("PDW &amp;amp; A first must compute its discharge of indebtedness income and set this figure aside temporarily. The corporation then must calculate its net operating loss tax attribute . . . . Finally, the corporation must apply the excluded discharged debt to reduce its tax attributes. In this case, the net operating loss tax attribute fully absorbs the corporation's excluded discharge of indebtedness income. Thus, there are no items of income to pass through to Gitlitz and Winn").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9]  Similar to this argument is the contention that, in cases such as this one in which the shareholders' suspended losses are fully deducted before attribute reduction could take place, no net operating loss remains and no attribute reduction can occur, thus rendering &#167; 108(b) inoperative. However, there will be other cases in which &#167; 108(b) will be inoperative. In particular, if a taxpayer has no tax attributes at all, there will be no reduction. Certainly the statute does not condition the exclusion under &#167; 108(a) on the ability of the taxpayer to reduce attributes under &#167; 108(b). Likewise, in the case of shareholders similarly situated to petitioners in this case, there is also the possibility that other attributes, see &#167;&#167; 108(b)(2)(B)&#151;(G), could be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[10]  The benefit at issue in this case arises in part because &#167; 108(d)(7)(A) permits the exclusion of discharge of indebtedness income from gross income for an insolvent S corporation even when the S corporation shareholder is personally solvent. We are aware of no other instance in which &#167; 108 directly benefits a solvent entity. However, the result is required by statute. Between 1982 and 1984, &#167; 108 provided that the exclusion from gross income and the reduction in tax attributes occurred at the shareholder level. See Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982, Pub. L. 97-354, &#167; 3(e), 96 Stat. 1689. This provision, which paralleled the current taxation of partnerships at the partner level, see 26 U. S. C. &#167; 108(d)(6), prevented solvent shareholders from benefiting as a result of their S corporation's insolvency. In 1984, however, Congress amended the Code to provide that &#167; 108 be applied "at the corporate level." Tax Reform Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98-369, &#167; 721(b), 98 Stat. 966. It is as a direct result of this amendment that the solvent petitioners in this case are able to benefit from &#167; 108's exclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*231&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*232&lt;/span&gt; Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which O'Connor, Scalia, Souter, Thomas, and Breyer, JJ., joined. Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Kennedy, J., joined, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 245.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mark V. Meierhenry&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed briefs for petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beth S. Brinkmann&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondents. With her on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Robinson,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Ginsburg, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress has provided, in 18 U. S. C. &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B), that the Bureau of Prisons (Bureau or BOP) may reduce by up to one year the prison term of an inmate convicted of a nonviolent felony, if the prisoner successfully completes a substance abuse program. The Bureau's implementing regulation &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*233&lt;/span&gt; categorically denies early release to prisoners whose current offense is a felony attended by "the carrying, possession, or use of a firearm." 28 CFR &#167; 550.58(a)(1)(vi)(B) (2000). The validity of the Bureau's regulation is the question presented in this case. We hold, in accord with the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, that the regulation is a permissible exercise of the Bureau's discretion under 18 U. S. C. &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title 18 U. S. C. &#167; 3621 governs the imprisonment of persons convicted of federal crimes. In 1990, Congress amended the statute to provide that "[t]he Bureau shall . . . make available appropriate substance abuse treatment for each prisoner the Bureau determines has a treatable condition of substance addiction or abuse." Pub. L. 101-647, &#167; 2903, 104 Stat. 4913. Four years later, Congress again amended &#167; 3621, this time to provide incentives for prisoner participation in BOP drug treatment programs. The incentive provision at issue reads: "The period a prisoner convicted of a nonviolent offense remains in custody after successfully completing a treatment program may be reduced by the Bureau of Prisons, but such reduction may not be more than one year from the term the prisoner must otherwise serve." Pub. L. 103-322, &#167; 32001, 108 Stat. 1897 (codified at 18 U. S. C. &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1995, the Bureau published a rule to implement the early release incentive. 60 Fed. Reg. 27692-27695; 28 CFR &#167; 550.58. Because the statute explicitly confined the incentive to prisoners convicted of "nonviolent offense[s]," 18 U. S. C. &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B), the BOP ranked ineligible for early release all inmates currently incarcerated for "crime[s] of violence," 60 Fed. Reg. 27692. As explained in the Bureau's program statement, the BOP defined "crimes of violence" to include a drug trafficking conviction under 21 U. S. C. &#167; 841, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*234&lt;/span&gt; if the offender received a two-level sentence enhancement under United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (USSG) &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1) (Nov. 2000), for possessing a dangerous weapon during commission of the drug offense. Bureau of Prisons Program Statement No. 5162.02, &#167; 9 (July 24, 1995), reprinted in App. to Brief for Petitioner 17-18.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; "[E]xercising [its] discretion in reducing a sentence," the Bureau also excluded from early release eligibility inmates who had a prior conviction "for homicide, forcible rape, robbery, or aggravated assault." 60 Fed. Reg. 27692 (codified at 28 CFR &#167; 550.58 (1995)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Courts of Appeals divided over the validity of the Bureau's definition of crimes of violence to include drug offenses that involved possession of a firearm. A majority of Circuits, including the Eighth, held that &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B) required the Bureau to look only to the offense of conviction (drug trafficking), and not to sentencing factors (firearm possession), in determining whether an offender was convicted of a "nonviolent offense," and was therefore eligible under the statute for the early release incentive. &lt;i&gt;Martin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gerlinski,&lt;/i&gt;  133 F. 3d 1076, 1079 (CA8 1998); see also &lt;i&gt;Fristoe&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Thompson,&lt;/i&gt; 144 F. 3d 627, 631 (CA10 1998); &lt;i&gt;Byrd&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hasty,&lt;/i&gt; 142 F. 3d 1395, 1398 (CA11 1998); &lt;i&gt;Roussos&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Menifee,&lt;/i&gt; 122 F. 3d 159, 164 (CA3 1997); &lt;i&gt;Downey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Crabtree,&lt;/i&gt; 100 F. 3d 662, 668 (CA9 1996). The Fourth and Fifth Circuits, however, upheld the Bureau's classification of drug offenses attended by firearm possession as violent crimes. &lt;i&gt;Pelissero&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Thompson,&lt;/i&gt; 170 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*235&lt;/span&gt; F. 3d 442, 447 (CA4 1999); &lt;i&gt;Venegas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Henman,&lt;/i&gt; 126 F. 3d 760, 763 (CA5 1997).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This split among the Circuits prompted the Bureau in 1997 to publish the regulation now before the Court. See 62 Fed. Reg. 53690-53691. Like the 1995 rule, the current regulation excludes from early release eligibility offenders who possessed a firearm in connection with their offenses. In contrast to the earlier rule, however, the 1997 regulation does not order this exclusion by defining the statutory term "prisoner convicted of a nonviolent offense" or the cognate term "crimes of violence." Instead, the current regulation relies upon "the discretion allotted to the Director of the Bureau of Prisons in granting a sentence reduction to exclude [enumerated categories of] inmates." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 53690. The regulation, designed to achieve consistent administration of the incentive, now provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(a) &lt;i&gt;Additional early release criteria.&lt;/i&gt; (1) As an exercise of the discretion vested in the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the following categories of inmates are not eligible for early release:&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(iv) Inmates who have a prior felony or misdemeanor conviction for homicide, forcible rape, robbery, or aggravated assault, or child sexual abuse offenses;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(vi) Inmates whose current offense is a felony:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(B) That involved the carrying, possession, or use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon . . . ." 28 CFR &#167; 550.58(a) (2000).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, the 1995 rule defined the statutory term "prisoner convicted of a nonviolent offense" to exclude categorically an inmate who possessed a firearm in connection with his offense. The current regulation categorically excludes such an inmate, not because &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B) so mandates, but pursuant &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*236&lt;/span&gt; to the Bureau's asserted discretion to prescribe additional early release criteria. Drug traffickers who possess firearms when they engage in crimes are no longer characterized as "violent" offenders within the meaning of the statute. But they are bracketed, for sentence reduction purposes, with persons currently incarcerated for "nonviolent offense[s]" who in the past committed crimes qualifying as violent. The preconviction conduct of both armed offenders and certain redicivists, in the Bureau's view, "suggest[s] that they pose a particular risk to the public." Brief for Respondents 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1997, petitioner Christopher A. Lopez was convicted of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U. S. C. &#167; 841. Upon finding that Lopez possessed a firearm in connection with his offense, the District Court enhanced his sentence by two levels pursuant to USSG &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1). Lopez is currently scheduled to be released from prison in June 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While incarcerated, Lopez requested substance abuse treatment. The Bureau found him qualified for its residential drug abuse program,&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; but categorically ineligible, under 28 CFR &#167; 550.58(a)(1)(vi), for early release. App. 3-7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When notified that he would not be a candidate for early release, Lopez challenged the BOP's determination by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, under 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2241, in the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota. The District Court granted the petition. In that court's view, the Bureau's 1997 regulation did not correct the infirmity the Eighth Circuit saw in the 1995 rule. See App. 17-18, and n. 4 (citing &lt;i&gt;Martin,&lt;/i&gt; 133 F. 3d, at 1079). "[I]t is true," the District Court recognized, "that the BOP &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*237&lt;/span&gt; may exercise a great deal of discretion in determining who among the eligible nonviolent offenders may be released." App. 17. But, the District Court held, the BOP may not categorically count out, "based upon sentencing factors or weapon possession," inmates whose underlying conviction was for a nonviolent crime. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 18. Accordingly, the District Court ordered the BOP "to reconsider Lopez's eligibility for early release." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eighth Circuit reversed. &lt;i&gt;Bellis&lt;/i&gt; v.&lt;i&gt;Davis,&lt;/i&gt; 186 F. 3d 1092 (1999). Section 3621(e)(2)(B), the Court of Appeals observed, "states only that the prison term of an inmate convicted of a nonviolent offense `&lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt; be reduced by the Bureau of Prisons.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1094 (quoting 18 U. S. C. &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B)). This discretionary formulation, the Eighth Circuit reasoned, allows the Bureau to devise a regime based on criteria that can be uniformly applied. The statute grants no entitlement to any inmate or class of inmates, the Court of Appeals noted, and it does not instruct the Bureau to make "individual, rather than categorical, assessments of eligibility for inmates convicted of nonviolent offenses." 186 F. 3d, at 1094. The court further reasoned that, to the extent Congress left a gap in &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B) for the Bureau to fill, deference is owed the BOP's interpretation under &lt;i&gt;Chevron U. S. A. Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 837, 843-845, 866 (1984), so long as the interpretation is a permissible construction of the statute. 186 F. 3d, at 1095. The Bureau had elected to deny early release to certain categories of prisoners, notably recidivists and firearms carriers, whose "conduct indicates that they pose a serious risk to public safety." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; That decision, the Court of Appeals concluded, "represents a manifestly permissible construction of the statute and an appropriate exercise of the BOP's discretion." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eighth Circuit next explained why its earlier decision in &lt;i&gt;Martin&lt;/i&gt; did not control this case, which trains on the BOP's 1997 regulation: &lt;i&gt;Martin&lt;/i&gt; addressed only the Bureau's 1995 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*238&lt;/span&gt; attempt to interpret the statutory term "nonviolent offense"; the court in that case did not address "whether the BOP may, as an exercise of its discretion, . . . look to sentencing factors in deciding which individuals among statutorily eligible inmates are appropriate candidates for early release." 186 F. 3d, at 1095. Facing that issue, the Court of Appeals held such an exercise of discretion proper. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Courts of Appeals have again divided, now over the permissibility of the Bureau's current (1997) regulation. The Tenth and Eleventh Circuits, in line with their prior decisions invalidating the 1995 rule, have concluded that &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B) permits no categorical exclusions of nonviolent offenders based on sentence enhancements. &lt;i&gt;Ward&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Booker,&lt;/i&gt; 202 F. 3d 1249, 1256-1257 (CA10 2000); &lt;i&gt;Kilpatrick&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Houston,&lt;/i&gt; 197 F. 3d 1134, 1135 (CA11 1999). The Ninth Circuit, on the other hand, has agreed with the Eighth Circuit that precedent invalidating the 1995 rule does not control and that, in 1997, the BOP permissibly exercised its discretion under &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B) when it categorically excluded from early release consideration inmates who possessed a firearm in connection with their nonviolent offenses. &lt;i&gt;Bowen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hood,&lt;/i&gt; 202 F. 3d 1211, 1218-1220 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict, 529 U. S. 1086 (2000), and now affirm the judgment of the Eighth Circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statute provides: "The period a prisoner convicted of a nonviolent offense remains in custody after successfully completing a treatment program may be reduced by the Bureau of Prisons . . . ." 18 U. S. C. &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B). The measure thus categorically denies early release eligibility to inmates convicted of violent offenses. The question we address is whether the Bureau has discretion to delineate, as an additional category of ineligible inmates, those whose current offense is a felony involving a firearm. 28 CFR &#167; 550.58(a)(1)(vi)(B) (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*239&lt;/span&gt; Lopez urges that the statute is unambiguous. He says that, by identifying a class of inmates ineligible for sentence reductions under &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B), &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; those convicted of a violent offense, Congress has barred the Bureau from identifying further categories of ineligible inmates. "If Congress wanted the BOP to reduce the categories of inmates eligible for the early release incentive (beyond the one identified by Congress), Congress would have specifically placed this grant of authority in the language of the statute." Brief for Petitioner 23. As to the statutory instruction that the Bureau "may" reduce sentences, Lopez initially suggests it is merely a grant of authority to the BOP to reduce a sentence that, prior to the enactment of &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B), could not be reduced for successful completion of drug treatment: "The power granted was to give reductions not the power to decide who was eligible to receive reductions." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 21. He alternately contends that the Bureau may take into account only "post-conviction conduct," not "pre-conviction conduct." Reply Brief 4-5. Acting on a case-by-case basis, Lopez asserts, the Bureau may "deny early release to those inmates [who] are statutorily eligible, but who do not deserve early release based on their conduct while in prison." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 5. Under this reading, the Bureau may exercise discretion in denying early release, but only on an individual basis, taking account solely of postconviction conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bureau's view, &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B) establishes two prerequisites for sentence reduction: conviction of a nonviolent offense and successful completion of drug treatment. Brief for Respondents 18. If those prerequisites are met, the Bureau "may," but also may &lt;i&gt;not,&lt;/i&gt; grant early release. The BOP opposes Lopez's argument that Congress barred the Bureau from imposing limitations categorically or on the basis of preconviction conduct. According to the Bureau, Congress simply "did not address how the Bureau should exercise its discretion within the class of inmates who satisfy the statutory prerequisites for early release." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 23. Because &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*240&lt;/span&gt; Congress left the question unaddressed, the Bureau maintains, the agency may exclude inmates either categorically or on a case-by-case basis, subject of course to its obligation to interpret the statute reasonably, see &lt;i&gt;Chevron,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S., at 844, in a manner that is not arbitrary or capricious, see 5 U. S. C. &#167; 706(2)(A). In this instance, the Bureau urges, it has acted reasonably: Its denial of early release to all inmates who possessed a firearm in connection with their current offense rationally reflects the view that such inmates displayed a readiness to endanger another's life; accordingly, in the interest of public safety, they should not be released months in advance of completing their sentences.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We agree with the Bureau's position. Preliminarily, we note conspicuous anomalies in Lopez's construction. If &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B) functions not as a grant of discretion to determine early release eligibility, but both as an authorization and a command to reduce sentences, then Congress' use of the word "may," rather than "shall," has no significance. And if the BOP does have discretion to deny early release to certain inmates, but only based on individualized assessments of postconviction conduct, then the agency cannot categorically deny early release even to recidivists with prior (perhaps multiple) convictions for "homicide, forcible rape . . . , or child sexual abuse offenses." 28 CFR &#167; 550.58(a)(1)(iv) (2000). For that provision, as much as the exclusion of inmates imprisoned for offenses involving a firearm, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 235, entails no individualized determination based on postconviction conduct. Furthermore, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*241&lt;/span&gt; Lopez's position would confine the BOP's discretion under &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B) to consideration of factors of the kind the Bureau already may consider in granting credit for "satisfactory behavior." See 18 U. S. C. &#167; 3624(b)(1) ("a prisoner [serving a term of more than one year and less than life] may receive credit toward the service of the prisoner's sentence . . . subject to determination by the Bureau of Prisons that, during that year, the prisoner has displayed exemplary compliance with such institutional disciplinary regulations").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We turn now to the Bureau's reading of the statutory text, which instructs that the agency "may" reduce the sentence of a nonviolent offender who has successfully completed a drug treatment program. Congress' use of the permissive "may" in &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B) contrasts with the legislators' use of a mandatory "shall" in the very same section. Elsewhere in &#167; 3621, Congress used "shall" to impose discretionless obligations, including the obligation to provide drug treatment when funds are available. See 18 U. S. C. &#167; 3621(e)(1) ("Bureau of Prisons shall, subject to the availability of appropriations, provide residential substance abuse treatment (and make arrangements for appropriate aftercare)"); see also, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; &#167; 3621(b) ("The Bureau shall designate the place of the prisoner's imprisonment. . . . In designating the place of imprisonment or making transfers under this subsection, there shall be no favoritism given to prisoners of high social or economic status."). Sensibly read, the grant of discretion in &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B) to decide whether to reduce a sentence parallels the grant of discretion in &#167; 3621(e)(2)(A) to retain a prisoner who successfully completes drug treatment "under such [custodial] conditions as the Bureau deems appropriate." &#167; 3621(e)(2)(A). When an eligible prisoner successfully completes drug treatment, the Bureau thus has the authority, but not the duty, both to alter the prisoner's conditions of confinement and to reduce his term of imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constraints Lopez urges&#151;requiring the BOP to make individualized determinations based only on postconviction &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*242&lt;/span&gt; conduct&#151;are nowhere to be found in &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B). Beyond instructing that the Bureau has discretion to reduce the period of imprisonment for a nonviolent offender who successfully completes drug treatment, Congress has not identified any further circumstance in which the Bureau either must grant the reduction, or is forbidden to do so. In this familiar situation, where Congress has enacted a law that does not answer "the precise question at issue," all we must decide is whether the Bureau, the agency empowered to administer the early release program, has filled the statutory gap "in a way that is reasonable in light of the legislature's revealed design." &lt;i&gt;Nations bank of N. C., N. A.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 513 U. S. 251, 257 (1995) (citing &lt;i&gt;Chevron,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S., at 842); see also &lt;i&gt;Reno&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Koray,&lt;/i&gt;  515 U. S. 50, 61 (1995) (deferring to BOP's interpretation of statute). We think the agency's interpretation is reasonable both in taking account of preconviction conduct and in making categorical exclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, as the dissent but not Lopez recognizes, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 248, the Bureau need not blind itself to preconviction conduct that the agency reasonably views as jeopardizing life and limb. By denying eligibility to violent offenders, the statute manifests congressional concern for preconviction behavior&#151;and for the very conduct leading to conviction. The Bureau may reasonably attend to these factors as well. Its regulation in this regard is kin to the Attorney General's order upheld in &lt;i&gt;INS&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Yueh-Shaio Yang,&lt;/i&gt; 519 U. S. 26 (1996). That case involved a statute authorizing the Attorney General to waive deportation of aliens deportable for entry fraud. The Attorney General had refused to waive deportation for one alien because of "acts of fraud . . . in connection with his entry." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 27. The alien argued that because the statute made aliens who had committed entry fraud eligible for waiver, the Attorney General was precluded from taking such conduct into account "at all" in deciding whether to grant relief. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 30. We rejected this view, stating &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*243&lt;/span&gt; that the statute "establishes only the alien's &lt;i&gt;eligibility&lt;/i&gt; for the waiver. Such eligibility in no way limits the considerations that may guide the Attorney General in exercising her discretion to determine who, among those eligible, will be accorded grace." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 31. Similarly in this case, the statute's restriction of early release eligibility to nonviolent offenders does not cut short the considerations that may guide the Bureau. Just as the Attorney General permissibly considered aspects of entry fraud, even though entry fraud was a criterion of statutory eligibility, so the Bureau may consider aspects of the conduct of conviction, even though the conviction is a criterion of statutory eligibility.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also reject Lopez's argument, echoed in part by the dissent, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 248-249, that the agency must not make categorical exclusions, but may rely only on case-by-case assessments.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; "[E]ven if a statutory scheme requires individualized &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*244&lt;/span&gt; determinations," which this scheme does not, "the decision maker has the authority to rely on rulemaking to resolve certain issues of general applicability unless Congress clearly expresses an intent to withhold that authority." &lt;i&gt;American Hospital Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;NLRB,&lt;/i&gt; 499 U. S. 606, 612 (1991); accord, &lt;i&gt;Heckler&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Campbell,&lt;/i&gt; 461 U. S. 458, 467 (1983). The approach pressed by Lopez&#151;case-by-case decision making in thousands of cases each year, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 243, n. 4&#151;could invite favoritism, disunity, and inconsistency. The Bureau is not required continually to revisit "issues that may be established fairly and efficiently in a single rulemaking proceeding." &lt;i&gt;Heckler,&lt;/i&gt; 461 U. S., at 467.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having decided that the Bureau may categorically exclude prisoners based on their preconviction conduct, we further hold that the regulation excluding Lopez is permissible. The Bureau reasonably concluded that an inmate's prior involvement with firearms, in connection with the commission of a felony, suggests his readiness to resort to lifeendangering violence and therefore appropriately determines the early release decision.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*245&lt;/span&gt; For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt; Justice Stevens, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question at issue in this case is whether all, or merely some, of the federal prisoners who were convicted of nonviolent offenses and who have successfully completed a Bureau of Prisons (BOP or Bureau) drug treatment program are eligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U. S. C. &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B). For the reasons outlined below, I believe that Congress has answered that precise question. The statute expressly states that the sentence of every prisoner in that category "may be reduced." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; The disposition of this case is therefore governed by the first step in the familiar test announced in &lt;i&gt;Chevron U. S. A. Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 837, 842-843 (1984), for "Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 842.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In drafting the statute in question, Congress was faced with a difficult policy choice: whether the commission of particular crimes made certain categories of offenders so dangerous that the costs of offering them early release in return for the successful completion of a drug treatment program outweighed the rewards. The initial drafts of the bill answered that question in the negative and made all federal prisoners eligible for a sentence reduction of up to one year if they successfully completed a drug treatment program. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; H. R. Rep. No. 103-320, p. 2 (1993). However, the inclusion of those convicted of violent offenses within the category of those eligible for the inducement soon became a fulcrum of criticism for the larger crime bill within &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*246&lt;/span&gt; which the statute was embedded.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Perhaps as a result of these criticisms,&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; the statute ultimately adopted limited the inducement to "prisoner[s] convicted of . . . nonviolent offense[s]." 18 U. S. C. &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the text of the statute and the aforementioned history demonstrate that Congress directly addressed the "precise question" of what offenses ought to disqualify prisoners from eligibility for a sentence reduction, and that its unambiguous answer was "violent offenses." Under the statute as enacted, those who commit crimes of violence are categorically barred from receiving a sentence reduction while those convicted of nonviolent offenses "may" receive such an inducement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*247&lt;/span&gt; The BOP regulation challenged here operates to redefine the set of prisoners categorically ineligible for a sentence reduction, a set unambiguously defined in the text of the statute. It does so by taking a group of prisoners whose offenses the Bureau acknowledges are "nonviolent" within the meaning of the statute&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; and imposing the same sanction&#151;categorical ineligibility&#151;upon them as the statute imposes upon violent offenders. In so doing, the Bureau ignores Congress' express determination that, when evaluating eligibility for a sentence reduction, the salient distinction is the line between violent and nonviolent offenses. By moving this line, the BOP exceeded its authority and sought to exercise its discretion on an issue with regard to which it has none. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chevron,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S., at 842-843 ("First, always, is the question whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress"); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Haggar Apparel Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 526 U. S. 380, 392 (1999) ("In the process of considering a regulation in relation to specific factual situations, a court may conclude the regulation is inconsistent with the statutory language or is an unreasonable implementation of it. In those instances, the regulation will not control").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*248&lt;/span&gt; II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fully agree with the majority that federal prisoners do not become entitled to a sentence reduction upon their successful completion of a drug treatment program; the words "may be reduced" do not mean "shall be reduced." Nonetheless, while the statute does not entitle any prisoner to a sentence reduction, it does guarantee nonviolent offenders who successfully complete a drug treatment program consideration for such a reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every nonviolent offender who participates in a drug treatment program, the BOP may be required to make two individualized determinations: (1) whether he or she has successfully completed that program; and (2), if so, whether his or her preconviction conduct, postconviction conduct, and prospects for rehabilitation justify a sentence reduction. In evaluating whether or not a particular individual is entitled to a sentence reduction, the BOP may give great weight to whichever of these factors it determines to be most relevant. That, however, is a far cry from categorically excluding from consideration prisoners who Congress explicitly intended to obtain such consideration.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority's concern about the risks and burdens associated with case-by-case decision making in a large number of cases is understandable yet ultimately misguided. In order to fulfill the statute's requirements, the BOP must already &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*249&lt;/span&gt; evaluate every prisoner seeking the sentence reduction on an individual basis to determine whether that prisoner "successfully completed" his or her drug treatment program. Individualized consideration of the second salient question involves consideration of many of the same personalized factors that go into determining whether a prisoner's course of drug treatment has been "successful." To the extent that answering the second question requires consideration of additional factors with a concomitant administrative burden, the costs of such a scheme are, in Congress' judgment, outweighed by the benefits of encouraging drug treatment and of carefully distinguishing between those prisoners who have earned an early return to their communities and those who require further incarceration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority's worry that individualized decision making might lead to "favoritism, disunity, and inconsistency" is similarly misplaced. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 244. To suggest that decision making must be individualized is not to imply that it must also be standardless. If the Court today invalidated the regulation in question, its decision would not preclude the BOP from adopting a uniform set of criteria for consideration in evaluating applications for sentence reductions. Nor would it necessarily preclude the Bureau from giving dispositive weight to certain postconviction criteria or neardispositive weight to preconviction criteria. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Heckler&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Campbell,&lt;/i&gt; 461 U. S. 458, 467 (1983). The Bureau would remain free to structure its decision making in any way it saw fit as long as in so doing it did not contravene policy decisions explicitly made by the statute's drafters. As Congress has already addressed pre incarceration conduct in &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B), the Bureau may not categorically exclude a prisoner not convicted of a violent offense from consideration for early release on the basis of such conduct without exceeding the limits of its discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   &lt;i&gt;Stephen R. Sady&lt;/i&gt; filed a brief for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as &lt;i&gt;amici curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Title 21 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and (2) make it unlawful "to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance," or "to create, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to distribute or dispense, a counterfeit substance." Section 2D1.1(b)(1) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a two-level sentence enhancement if a dangerous weapon was possessed in connection with the commission of a drug offense. See USSG &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1) and comment., n. 3 (Nov. 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  To qualify for residential substance abuse treatment, an inmate must be "determined by the Bureau of Prisons to have a substance abuse problem" and be "willing to participate in [the] program." 18 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 3621(e)(5)(B)(i), (ii).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  The dissent straddles the fence, agreeing with Lopez that the statute addresses his case unambiguously, but disagreeing with him on precisely what the statute says. Lopez reads the statute to exclude Bureau consideration of preconviction conduct, Reply Brief 4-5; the dissent reads the same words to permit BOP consideration of such conduct, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 248 (opinion of Stevens, J.). These divergent readings hardly strengthen the dissent's assertion that Congress supplied a definitive answer to the "precise question" at issue. See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 245.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Lopez contends that the Bureau's creation of additional hurdles to receipt of a sentence reduction defeats Congress' purpose of giving inmates an incentive to undergo drug treatment. Brief for Petitioner 24-29. In &lt;i&gt;INS&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Yueh-Shaio Yang,&lt;/i&gt; 519 U. S. 26 (1996), we said that "[i]t could be argued that if the Attorney General determined that &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; entry fraud or misrepresentation, no matter how minor and no matter what the attendant circumstances, would cause her to withhold waiver, she would not be exercising the conferred discretion at all, but would be making a nullity of the statute." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 31. In this case, it is plain that the Bureau has not rendered &#167; 3621(e)'s incentive a nullity. A total of 6,559 inmates have received sentence reductions under &#167; 3621(e)(2)(B), including 2,633 inmates in Fiscal Year 1999 alone. Bureau of Prisons, Substance Abuse Treatment Programs in the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Report to Congress 8 (Jan. 2000). Moreover, inmates who do not qualify for early release, like inmates who do, receive other incentives to participate in substance abuse treatment. See 28 CFR &#167;&#167; 550.57(a)(1), (3) (2000) ("An inmate may receive incentives for his or her satisfactory involvement in the residential [drug treatment] program," including "[l]imited financial awards" and "[l]ocal institution incentives such as preferred living quarters or special recognition privileges.").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  The dissent appears to acknowledge that the Bureau may give "neardispositive weight to preconviction criteria." &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 249. To the extent the dissent would permit the BOP to accord heavy weight to preconviction conduct, the structured "[i]ndividualized [BOP] consideration" the dissent would allow, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 249, seems but a shade different from the forthright categorical exclusion the Bureau has adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  &lt;i&gt;Amici&lt;/i&gt; urge reversal on the ground that the Bureau violated the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act when it published the 1997 regulation. Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al.as &lt;i&gt;Amici Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 18-24. We decline to address this matter, which was not raised or decided below, or presented in the petition for certiorari. &lt;i&gt;Blessing&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Freestone,&lt;/i&gt; 520 U. S. 329, 340, n. 3 (1997).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  Lopez invokes the rule of lenity in urging us to accede to his interpretation. Because, as discussed above, the statute cannot be read to prohibit the Bureau from exercising its discretion categorically or on the basis of preconviction conduct, his reliance on the rule is unavailing. See &lt;i&gt;Caron&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 524 U. S. 308, 316 (1998) ("The rule of lenity is not invoked by a grammatical possibility. It does not apply if the ambiguous reading relied on is an implausible reading of the congressional purpose.").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Throughout 1993 and 1994, Republican leaders gave numerous speeches contrasting their proposed crime bill and the administration's. One contrast repeatedly stressed was that the Republican bill set aside more money for prison construction while the Democratic bill allocated greater funds to drug treatment. This difference allegedly reflected differing views as to how society should deal with violent criminals. To this end, Republican leaders repeatedly criticized the inclusion of violent criminals in the sentence reduction provision. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 139 Cong. Rec. 27209 (1994) (remarks of Sen. Hatch) ("Their treatment allows all Federal prisoners, including the most violent, to have their sentences reduced, if you will, at the Bureau of Prisons' discretion if they complete a drug treatment program. Boy, I can see where everybody is going to do that. You can imagine the sincerity of that"); 139 Cong. Rec. 27460 (1993) (remarks of Sen. Hatch) ("The Democratic crime bill actually permits the Bureau of Prisons to decrease the sentence of Federal inmates&#151;violent offenders included&#151;who complete drug treatment programs. Their bill also proposes that States be given grant money which can be used to implement home confinement and other alternative sanctions for violent offenders").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The House initially approved a version of the bill that would have extended the inducement to all federal prisoners. The Senate, where the criticism of the inclusion of violent offenders was more pronounced, see n. 1, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; limited the provision to nonviolent offenders. The Conference Committee accepted the Senate's limitation. H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103&#151; 711, p. 381 (1994).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  The BOP regulation challenged here treats an otherwise nonviolent offense where a gun was carried as a "nonviolent offense" within the meaning of the statute, and the case was argued on that assumption. As the majority notes, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 233-236, the BOP initially attempted to classify such crimes as violent offenses, but receded when the Courts of Appeals divided over the validity of such a construction. The question over which the Courts of Appeals initially divided is not before us today. If it were, the arguments raised by both sides would be quite different, with the debate likely focusing on whether "nonviolent offense" is best understood as a term of art or in relation to a more colloquial understanding of violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  This Court's decision in &lt;i&gt;INS&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Yueh-Shaio Yang,&lt;/i&gt; 519 U. S.26 (1996), relied upon by the majority, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 242-243, is not to the contrary. &lt;i&gt;Yueh-Shaio Yang&lt;/i&gt; did not involve an effort by an administrative agency to categorically exclude from consideration for a benefit a particular class of individuals because of a characteristic considered and rejected by Congress as a basis for categorical exclusion. Rather, that case involved the related yet distinct question whether such a characteristic may be given any weight by the agency in making an individualized case-by-case determination whether to grant the benefit to a particular individual. If the issue in this case were whether the BOP could even consider the nature of the offense in determining whether to grant a particular sentence reduction, &lt;i&gt;Yueh-Shaio Yang&lt;/i&gt; would be relevant to our analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*160&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*161&lt;/span&gt; Rehnquist, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined. Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 174.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Timothy S. Bishop&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Kaspar J. Stoffelmayr, Sharon Swingle,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;George J. Mannina, Jr.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deputy Solicitor General Wallace&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief for the federal respondents were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Schiffer, Malcolm L. Stewart,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;John A. Bryson. Myron M. Cherry&lt;/i&gt; filed a brief for respondents Village of Bartlett et al.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*162&lt;/span&gt; Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 404(a) of the Clean Water Act (CWA or Act), 86 Stat. 884, as amended, 33 U. S. C. &#167; 1344(a), regulates the discharge of dredged or fill material into "navigable waters." The United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) has interpreted &#167; 404(a) to confer federal authority over an abandoned sand and gravel pit in northern Illinois which provides habitat for migratory birds. We are asked to decide whether the provisions of &#167; 404(a) may be fairly extended to these waters, and, if so, whether Congress could exercise such authority consistent with the Commerce Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, &#167; 8, cl. 3. We answer the first question in the negative and therefore do not reach the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner, the Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County (SWANCC), is a consortium of 23 suburban Chicago &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*163&lt;/span&gt; cities and villages that united in an effort to locate and develop a disposal site for baled nonhazardous solid waste. The Chicago Gravel Company informed the municipalities of the availability of a 533-acre parcel, bestriding the Illinois counties Cook and Kane, which had been the site of a sand and gravel pit mining operation for three decades up until about 1960. Long since abandoned, the old mining site eventually gave way to a successional stage forest, with its remnant excavation trenches evolving into a scattering of permanent and seasonal ponds of varying size (from under one-tenth of an acre to several acres) and depth (from several inches to several feet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The municipalities decided to purchase the site for disposal of their baled nonhazardous solid waste. By law, SWANCC was required to file for various permits from Cook County and the State of Illinois before it could begin operation of its bale fill project. In addition, because the operation called for the filling of some of the permanent and seasonal ponds, SWANCC contacted federal respondents (hereinafter respondents), including the Corps, to determine if a federal landfill permit was required under &#167; 404(a) of the CWA, 33 U. S. C. &#167; 1344(a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 404(a) grants the Corps authority to issue permits "for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters at specified disposal sites." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; The term "navigable waters" is defined under the Act as "the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas." &#167; 1362(7). The Corps has issued regulations defining the term "waters of the United States" to include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"waters such as intrastate lakes, rivers, streams (including intermittent streams), mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, playa lakes, or natural ponds, the use, degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate or foreign commerce . . . ." 33 CFR &#167; 328.3(a)(3) (1999).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*164&lt;/span&gt; In 1986, in an attempt to "clarify" the reach of its jurisdiction, the Corps stated that &#167; 404(a) extends to in strastate waters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"a. Which are or would be used as habitat by birds protected by Migratory Bird Treaties; or&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"b. Which are or would be used as habitat by other migratory birds which cross state lines; or&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"c. Which are or would be used as habitat for endangered species; or&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"d. Used to irrigate crops sold in interstate commerce." 51 Fed. Reg. 41217.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last promulgation has been dubbed the "Migratory Bird Rule."&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Corps initially concluded that it had no jurisdiction over the site because it contained no "wetlands," or areas which support "vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions," 33 CFR &#167; 328.3(b) (1999). However, after the Illinois Nature Preserves Commission informed the Corps that a number of migratory bird species had been observed at the site, the Corps reconsidered and ultimately asserted jurisdiction over the balefill site pursuant to subpart (b) of the "Migratory Bird Rule." The Corps found that approximately 121 bird species had been observed at the site, including several known to depend upon aquatic environments for a significant portion of their life requirements. Thus, on November 16, 1987, the Corps formally "determined that the seasonally ponded, abandoned gravel mining depressions located on the project site, while not wetlands, did qualify as `waters of the United States' . . . based upon the following criteria: (1) the proposed site had been abandoned as a gravel mining operation; (2) the water areas and spoil piles had developed a natural character; and (3) the water areas &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*165&lt;/span&gt; are used as habitat by migratory bird &lt;i&gt;[sic]&lt;/i&gt; which cross state lines." U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Chicago District, Dept. of Army Permit Evaluation and Decision Document, Lodging of Petitioner, Tab No. 1, p. 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the application process, SWANCC made several proposals to mitigate the likely displacement of the migratory birds and to preserve a great blue heron rookery located on the site. Its balefill project ultimately received the necessary local and state approval. By 1993, SWANCC had received a special use planned development permit from the Cook County Board of Appeals, a landfill development permit from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, and approval from the Illinois Department of Conservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite SWANCC's securing the required water quality certification from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, the Corps refused to issue a &#167; 404(a) permit. The Corps found that SWANCC had not established that its proposal was the "least environmentally damaging, most practicable alternative" for disposal of nonhazardous solid waste; that SWANCC's failure to set aside sufficient funds to remediate leaks posed an "unacceptable risk to the public's drinking water supply"; and that the impact of the project upon area-sensitive species was "unmitigatable since a landfill surface cannot be redeveloped into a forested habitat." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 87.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner filed suit under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. &#167; 701 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; in the Northern District of Illinois challenging both the Corps' jurisdiction over the site and the merits of its denial of the &#167; 404(a) permit. The District Court granted summary judgment to respondents on the jurisdictional issue, and petitioner abandoned its challenge to the Corps' permit decision. On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, petitioner renewed its attack on respondents' use of the "Migratory Bird Rule" to assert jurisdiction over the site. Petitioner argued that respondents had exceeded their statutory authority in interpreting &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*166&lt;/span&gt; the CWA to cover nonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters based upon the presence of migratory birds and, in the alternative, that Congress lacked the power under the Commerce Clause to grant such regulatory jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals began its analysis with the constitutional question, holding that Congress has the authority to regulate such waters based upon "the cumulative impact doctrine, under which a single activity that itself has no discernible effect on interstate commerce may still be regulated if the aggregate effect of that class of activity has a substantial impact on interstate commerce." 191 F. 3d 845, 850 (CA7 1999). The aggregate effect of the "destruction of the natural habitat of migratory birds" on interstate commerce, the court held, was substantial because each year millions of Americans cross state lines and spend over a billion dollars to hunt and observe migratory birds.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; The Court of Appeals then turned to the regulatory question. The court held that the CWA reaches as many waters as the Commerce Clause allows and, given its earlier Commerce Clause ruling, it therefore followed that respondents' "Migratory Bird Rule" was a reasonable interpretation of the Act. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 851-852.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We granted certiorari, 529 U. S. 1129 (2000), and now reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress passed the CWA for the stated purpose of "restor[ing] and maintain[ing] the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters." 33 U. S. C. &#167; 1251(a). In so doing, Congress chose to "recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*167&lt;/span&gt; States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution, to plan the development and use (including restoration, preservation, and enhancement) of land and water resources, and to consult with the Administrator in the exercise of his authority under this chapter." &#167; 1251(b). Relevant here, &#167; 404(a) authorizes respondents to regulate the discharge of fill material into "navigable waters," 33 U. S. C. &#167; 1344(a), which the statute defines as "the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas," &#167; 1362(7). Respondents have interpreted these words to cover the abandoned gravel pit at issue here because it is used as habitat for migratory birds. We conclude that the "Migratory Bird Rule" is not fairly supported by the CWA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time we have been called upon to evaluate the meaning of &#167; 404(a). In &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 474 U. S. 121 (1985), we held that the Corps had &#167; 404(a) jurisdiction over wetlands that actually abutted on a navigable waterway. In so doing, we noted that the term "navigable" is of "limited import" and that Congress evidenced its intent to "regulate at least some waters that would not be deemed `navigable' under the classical understanding of that term." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 133. But our holding was based in large measure upon Congress' unequivocal acquiescence to, and approval of, the Corps' regulations interpreting the CWA to cover wetlands adjacent to navigable waters. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 135-139. We found that Congress' concern for the protection of water quality and aquatic ecosystems indicated its intent to regulate wetlands "inseparably bound up with the `waters' of the United States." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 134.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the significant nexus between the wetlands and "navigable waters" that informed our reading of the CWA in &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview Homes.&lt;/i&gt; Indeed, we did not "express any opinion" on the "question of the authority of the Corps to regulate discharges of fill material into wetlands that are not adjacent to bodies of open water . . . ." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 131-132, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*168&lt;/span&gt; n. 8. In order to rule for respondents here, we would have to hold that the jurisdiction of the Corps extends to ponds that are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; adjacent to open water. But we conclude that the text of the statute will not allow this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the Corps' &lt;i&gt;original&lt;/i&gt; interpretation of the CWA, promulgated two years after its enactment, is inconsistent with that which it espouses here. Its 1974 regulations defined &#167; 404(a)'s "navigable waters" to mean "those waters of the United States which are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide, and/or are presently, or have been in the past, or may be in the future susceptible for use for purposes of interstate or foreign commerce." 33 CFR &#167; 209.120(d)(1). The Corps emphasized that "[i]t is the water body's capability of use by the public for purposes of transportation or commerce which is the determinative factor." &#167; 209.260(e)(1). Respondents put forward no persuasive evidence that the Corps mistook Congress' intent in 1974.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondents next contend that whatever its original aim in 1972, Congress charted a new course five years later when it approved the more expansive definition of "navigable waters" found in the Corps' 1977 regulations. In July 1977, the Corps formally adopted 33 CFR &#167; 323.2(a)(5) (1978), which defined "waters of the United States" to include "isolated wetlands and lakes, intermittent streams, prairie potholes, and other waters that are not part of a tributary system to interstate waters or to navigable waters of the United States, the degradation or destruction of which could affect &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*169&lt;/span&gt; interstate commerce." Respondents argue that Congress was aware of this more expansive interpretation during its 1977 amendments to the CWA. Specifically, respondents point to a failed House bill, H. R. 3199, that would have defined "navigable waters" as "all waters which are presently used, or are susceptible to use in their natural condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce." 123 Cong. Rec. 10420, 10434 (1977).&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; They also point to the passage in &#167; 404(g)(1) that authorizes a State to apply to the Environmental Protection Agency for permission "to administer its own individual and general permit program for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters (other than those waters which are presently used, or are susceptible to use in their natural condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce . . . , including wetlands adjacent thereto) within its jurisdiction . . . ." 33 U. S. C. &#167; 1344(g)(1). The failure to pass legislation that would have overturned the Corps' 1977 regulations and the extension of jurisdiction in &#167; 404(g) to waters "other than" traditional "navigable waters," respondents submit, indicate that Congress recognized and accepted a broad definition of "navigable waters" that includes nonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we have recognized congressional acquiescence to administrative interpretations of a statute in some situations, we have done so with extreme care.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; "[F]ailed legislative &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*170&lt;/span&gt; proposals are `a particularly dangerous ground on which to rest an interpretation of a prior statute.' " &lt;i&gt;Central Bank of Denver, N. A.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A.,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S. 164, 187 (1994) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;LTV Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 496 U. S. 633, 650 (1990)). A bill can be proposed for any number of reasons, and it can be rejected for just as many others. The relationship between the actions and inactions of the 95th Congress and the intent of the 92d Congress in passing &#167; 404(a) is also considerably attenuated. Because "subsequent history is less illuminating than the contemporaneous evidence," &lt;i&gt;Hagen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Utah,&lt;/i&gt; 510 U. S. 399, 420 (1994), respondents face a difficult task in overcoming the plain text and import of &#167; 404(a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that respondents have failed to make the necessary showing that the failure of the 1977 House bill demonstrates Congress' acquiescence to the Corps' regulations or the "Migratory Bird Rule," which, of course, did not first appear until 1986. Although respondents cite some legislative history showing Congress' recognition of the Corps' assertion of jurisdiction over "isolated waters,"&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; as we explained in &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview Homes,&lt;/i&gt; "[i]n both Chambers, debate on the proposals to narrow the definition of navigable waters centered largely on the issue of wetlands preservation." 474 U. S., at 136. Beyond Congress' desire to regulate &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*171&lt;/span&gt; wetlands adjacent to "navigable waters," respondents point us to no persuasive evidence that the House bill was proposed in response to the Corps' claim of jurisdiction over nonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters or that its failure indicated congressional acquiescence to such jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 404(g) is equally unenlightening. In &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview Homes&lt;/i&gt; we recognized that Congress intended the phrase "navigable waters" to include "at least some waters that would not be deemed `navigable' under the classical understanding of that term." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 133. But &#167; 404(g) gives no intimation of what those waters might be; it simply refers to them as "other . . . waters." Respondents conjecture that "other . . . waters" must incorporate the Corps' 1977 regulations, but it is also plausible, as petitioner contends, that Congress simply wanted to include all waters adjacent to "navigable waters," such as nonnavigable tributaries and streams. The exact meaning of &#167; 404(g) is not before us and we express no opinion on it, but for present purposes it is sufficient to say, as we did in &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview Homes,&lt;/i&gt; that "&#167; 404(g)(1) does not conclusively determine the construction to be placed on the use of the term `waters' elsewhere in the Act (particularly in &#167; 502(7), which contains the relevant definition of `navigable waters') . . . ." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 138, n. 11.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thus decline respondents' invitation to take what they see as the next ineluctable step after &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview Homes:&lt;/i&gt; holding that isolated ponds, some only seasonal, wholly located within two Illinois counties, fall under &#167; 404(a)'s definition of "navigable waters" because they serve &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*172&lt;/span&gt; as habitat for migratory birds. As counsel for respondents conceded at oral argument, such a ruling would assume that "the use of the word navigable in the statute . . . does not have any independent significance." Tr. of Oral Arg. 28. We cannot agree that Congress' separate definitional use of the phrase "waters of the United States" constitutes a basis for reading the term "navigable waters" out of the statute. We said in &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview Homes&lt;/i&gt; that the word "navigable" in the statute was of "limited import," 474 U. S., at 133, and went on to hold that &#167; 404(a) extended to nonnavigable wetlands adjacent to open waters. But it is one thing to give a word limited effect and quite another to give it no effect whatever. The term "navigable" has at least the import of showing us what Congress had in mind as its authority for enacting the CWA: its traditional jurisdiction over waters that were or had been navigable in fact or which could reasonably be so made. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Appalachian Elec. Power Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 311 U. S. 377, 407-408 (1940).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondents&#151;relying upon all of the arguments addressed above&#151;contend that, at the very least, it must be said that Congress did not address the precise question of &#167; 404(a)'s scope with regard to nonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters, and that, therefore, we should give deference to the "Migratory Bird Rule." See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chevron U. S. A. Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 837 (1984). We find &#167; 404(a) to be clear, but even were we to agree with respondents, we would not extend &lt;i&gt;Chevron&lt;/i&gt;  deference here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where an administrative interpretation of a statute invokes the outer limits of Congress' power, we expect a clear indication that Congress intended that result. See &lt;i&gt;Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Florida Gulf Coast Building &amp;amp; Constr. Trades Council,&lt;/i&gt; 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988). This requirement stems from our prudential desire not to needlessly reach constitutional issues and our assumption that Congress does not casually authorize administrative agencies to interpret a &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*173&lt;/span&gt; statute to push the limit of congressional authority. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; This concern is heightened where the administrative interpretation alters the federal-state framework by permitting federal encroachment upon a traditional state power. See &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bass,&lt;/i&gt; 404 U. S. 336, 349 (1971) ("[U]nless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state balance"). Thus, "where an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress." &lt;i&gt;DeBartolo, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 575.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twice in the past six years we have reaffirmed the proposition that the grant of authority to Congress under the Commerce Clause, though broad, is not unlimited. See &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Morrison,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S. 598 (2000); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lopez,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S. 549 (1995). Respondents argue that the "Migratory Bird Rule" falls within Congress' power to regulate intrastate activities that "substantially affect" interstate commerce. They note that the protection of migratory birds is a "national interest of very nearly the first magnitude," &lt;i&gt;Missouri&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Holland,&lt;/i&gt; 252 U. S. 416, 435 (1920), and that, as the Court of Appeals found, millions of people spend over a billion dollars annually on recreational pursuits relating to migratory birds. These arguments raise significant constitutional questions. For example, we would have to evaluate the precise object or activity that, in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce. This is not clear, for although the Corps has claimed jurisdiction over petitioner's land because it contains water areas used as habitat by migratory birds, respondents now, &lt;i&gt;post litem motam,&lt;/i&gt; focus upon the fact that the regulated activity is petitioner's municipal landfill, which is "plainly of a commercial nature." Brief for Federal Respondents 43. But this is a far cry, indeed, from the "navigable waters" and "waters of the United States" to which the statute by its terms extends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*174&lt;/span&gt; These are significant constitutional questions raised by respondents' application of their regulations, and yet we find nothing approaching a clear statement from Congress that it intended &#167; 404(a) to reach an abandoned sand and gravel pit such as we have here. Permitting respondents to claim federal jurisdiction over ponds and mudflats falling within the "Migratory Bird Rule" would result in a significant impingement of the States' traditional and primary power over land and water use. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hess&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Port Authority TransHudson Corporation,&lt;/i&gt; 513 U. S. 30, 44 (1994) ("[R]egulation of land use [is] a function traditionally performed by local governments"). Rather than expressing a desire to readjust the federal-state balance in this manner, Congress chose to "recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of States . . . to plan the development and use . . . of land and water resources . . . ." 33 U. S. C. &#167; 1251(b). We thus read the statute as written to avoid the significant constitutional and federalism questions raised by respondents' interpretation, and therefore reject the request for administrative deference.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hold that 33 CFR &#167; 328.3(a)(3) (1999), as clarified and applied to petitioner's balefill site pursuant to the "Migratory Bird Rule," 51 Fed. Reg. 41217 (1986), exceeds the authority granted to respondents under &#167; 404(a) of the CWA. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is therefore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1969, the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio, coated with a slick of industrial waste, caught fire. Congress responded &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*175&lt;/span&gt; to that dramatic event, and to others like it, by enacting the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 817, as amended, 33 U. S. C. &#167; 1251 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; commonly known as the Clean Water Act (Clean Water Act, CWA, or Act).&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The Act proclaimed the ambitious goal of ending water pollution by 1985. &#167; 1251(a). The Court's past interpretations of the CWA have been fully consistent with that goal. Although Congress' vision of zero pollution remains unfulfilled, its pursuit has unquestionably retarded the destruction of the aquatic environment. Our Nation's waters no longer burn. Today, however, the Court takes an unfortunate step that needlessly weakens our principal safeguard against toxic water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is fair to characterize the Clean Water Act as "watershed" legislation. The statute endorsed fundamental changes in both the purpose and the scope of federal regulation of the Nation's waters. In &#167; 13 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 (RHA), 30 Stat. 1152, as amended, 33 U. S. C. &#167; 407, Congress had assigned to the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) the mission of regulating discharges into certain waters in order to protect their use as highways for the transportation of interstate and foreign commerce; the scope of the Corps' jurisdiction under the RHA accordingly extended only to waters that were "navigable." In the CWA, however, Congress broadened the Corps' mission to include the purpose of protecting the quality of our Nation's waters for esthetic, health, recreational, and environmental uses. The scope of its jurisdiction was therefore redefined to encompass all of "the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas." &#167; 1362(7). That definition requires neither actual nor potential navigability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court has previously held that the Corps' broadened jurisdiction under the CWA properly included an 80-acre &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*176&lt;/span&gt; parcel of low-lying marshy land that was not itself navigable, directly adjacent to navigable water, or even hydrologically connected to navigable water, but which was part of a larger area, characterized by poor drainage, that ultimately abutted a navigable creek. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 474 U. S. 121 (1985).&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Our broad finding in &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview&lt;/i&gt; that the 1977 Congress had acquiesced in the Corps' understanding of its jurisdiction applies equally to the 410-acre parcel at issue here. Moreover, once Congress crossed the legal watershed that separates navigable streams of commerce from marshes and inland lakes, there is no principled reason for limiting the statute's protection to those waters or wetlands that happen to lie near a navigable stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its decision today, the Court draws a new jurisdictional line, one that invalidates the 1986 migratory bird regulation as well as the Corps' assertion of jurisdiction over all waters &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*177&lt;/span&gt; except for actually navigable waters, their tributaries, and wetlands adjacent to each. Its holding rests on two equally untenable premises: (1) that when Congress passed the 1972 CWA, it did not intend "to exert anything more than its commerce power over navigation," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 168, n. 3; and (2) that in 1972 Congress drew the boundary defining the Corps' jurisdiction at the odd line on which the Court today settles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I shall explain, the text of the 1972 amendments affords no support for the Court's holding, and amendments Congress adopted in 1977 do support the Corps' present interpretation of its mission as extending to so-called "isolated" waters. Indeed, simple common sense cuts against the particular definition of the Corps' jurisdiction favored by the majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significance of the FWPCA Amendments of 1972 is illuminated by a reference to the history of federal water regulation, a history that the majority largely ignores. Federal regulation of the Nation's waters began in the 19th century with efforts targeted exclusively at "promot[ing] water transportation and commerce." Kalen, Commerce to Conservation: The Call for a National Water Policy and the Evolution of Federal Jurisdiction Over Wetlands, 69 N. D. L. Rev. 873, 877 (1993). This goal was pursued through the various Rivers and Harbors Acts, the most comprehensive of which was the RHA of 1899.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Section 13 of the 1899 RHA, commonly known as the Refuse Act, prohibited the discharge of "refuse" into any "navigable water" or its tributaries, as well as the deposit of "refuse" on the bank of a navigable water "whereby navigation shall or may be impeded or obstructed" without first obtaining a permit from the Secretary of the Army. 30 Stat. 1152.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*178&lt;/span&gt; During the middle of the 20th century, the goals of federal water regulation began to shift away from an exclusive focus on protecting navigability and toward a concern for preventing environmental degradation. Kalen, 69 N. D. L. Rev., at 877-879, and n. 30. This awakening of interest in the use of federal power to protect the aquatic environment was helped along by efforts to reinterpret &#167; 13 of the RHA in order to apply its permit requirement to industrial discharges into navigable waters, even when such discharges did nothing to impede navigability. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Republic Steel Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 362 U. S. 482, 490-491 (1960) (noting that the term "refuse" in &#167; 13 was broad enough to include industrial waste).&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; Seeds of this nascent concern with pollution control can also be found in the FWPCA, which was first enacted in 1948 and then incrementally expanded in the following years.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*179&lt;/span&gt; The shift in the focus of federal water regulation from protecting navigability toward environmental protection reached a dramatic climax in 1972, with the passage of the CWA. The Act, which was passed as an amendment to the existing FWPCA, was universally described by its supporters as the first truly comprehensive federal water pollution legislation. The "major purpose" of the CWA was "to establish a &lt;i&gt;comprehensive&lt;/i&gt; long-range policy for the elimination of water pollution." S. Rep. No. 92-414, p. 95 (1971), 2 Legislative History of the Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Committee Print compiled for the Senate Committee on Public Works by the Library of Congress), Ser. No. 93-1, p. 1511 (1971) (hereinafter Leg. Hist.) (emphasis added). And "[n]o Congressman's remarks on the legislation were complete without reference to [its] `comprehensive' nature . . . ." &lt;i&gt;Milwaukee&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Illinois,&lt;/i&gt; 451 U. S. 304, 318 (1981) (Rehnquist, J.). A House sponsor described the bill as "the most comprehensive and far-reaching water pollution bill we have ever drafted," 1 Leg. Hist. 369 (Rep. Mizell), and Senator Randolph, Chairman of the Committee on Public Works, stated: "It is perhaps the most comprehensive legislation that the Congress of the United States has ever developed in this particular field of the environment." 2 &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1269. This Court was therefore undoubtedly correct when it described the 1972 amendments as establishing "a comprehensive program for controlling and abating water pollution." &lt;i&gt;Train&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;City of New York,&lt;/i&gt; 420 U. S. 35, 37 (1975).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 404 of the CWA resembles &#167; 13 of the RHA, but, unlike the earlier statute, the primary purpose of which is the maintenance of navigability, &#167; 404 was principally intended as a pollution control measure. A comparison of the contents of the RHA and the 1972 Act vividly illustrates the fundamental difference between the purposes of the two provisions. The earlier statute contains pages of detailed appropriations for improvements in specific navigation facilities, 30 Stat. 1121-1149, for studies concerning the feasibility &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*180&lt;/span&gt; of a canal across the Isthmus of Panama, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1150, and for surveys of the advisability of harbor improvements at numerous other locations, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1155-1161. Tellingly, &#167; 13, which broadly prohibits the discharge of refuse into navigable waters, contains an exception for refuse "flowing from streets and sewers . . . in a liquid state." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1152.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1972 Act, in contrast, appropriated large sums of money for research and related programs for water pollution control, 86 Stat. 816-833, and for the construction of water treatment works, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 833-844. Strikingly absent from its declaration of "goals and policy" is &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; reference to avoiding or removing obstructions to navigation. Instead, the principal objective of the Act, as stated by Congress in &#167; 101, was "to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters." 33 U. S. C. &#167; 1251. Congress therefore directed federal agencies in &#167; 102 to "develop comprehensive programs for preventing, reducing, or eliminating the pollution of the navigable waters and ground waters and improving the sanitary condition of surface and underground waters." 33 U. S. C. &#167; 1252. The CWA commands federal agencies to give "due regard," not to the interest of unobstructed navigation, but rather to "improvements which are necessary to conserve such waters for the protection and propagation of fish and aquatic life and wildlife [and] recreational purposes." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the statute's ambitious and comprehensive goals, it was, of course, necessary to expand its jurisdictional scope. Thus, although Congress opted to carry over the traditional jurisdictional term "navigable waters" from the RHA and prior versions of the FWPCA, it broadened the &lt;i&gt;definition&lt;/i&gt; of that term to encompass all "waters of the United States." &#167; 1362(7).&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; Indeed, the 1972 conferees arrived at the final formulation by specifically deleting the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*181&lt;/span&gt; word "navigable" from the definition that had originally appeared in the House version of the Act.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; The majority today undoes that deletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conference Report explained that the definition in &#167; 502(7) was intended to "be given the broadest possible constitutional interpretation." S. Conf. Rep. No. 92-1236, p. 144 (1972), reprinted in 1 Leg. Hist. 327. The Court dismisses this clear assertion of legislative intent with the back of its hand. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 168, n. 3. The statement, it claims, "signifies that Congress intended to exert [nothing] more than its commerce power over navigation." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority's reading drains all meaning from the conference amendment. By 1972, Congress' Commerce Clause power over "navigation" had long since been established. &lt;i&gt;The Daniel Ball,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;557&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1871); &lt;i&gt;Gilman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Philadelphia,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/s5U/gilman-v-philadelphia/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;713&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1866); &lt;i&gt;Gibbons&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ogden,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/roC/gibbons-appellant-v-ogden-respondent/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wheat.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1824). Why should Congress intend that its assertion of federal jurisdiction be given the "broadest possible constitutional interpretation" if it did not intend to reach beyond the very heartland of its commerce power? The activities regulated by the CWA have nothing to do with Congress' "commerce power over navigation." Indeed, the goals of the 1972 statute have nothing to do with &lt;i&gt;navigation&lt;/i&gt; at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we recognized in &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview,&lt;/i&gt; the interests served by the statute embrace the protection of "`significant natural biological functions, including food chain production, general habitat, and nesting, spawning, rearing and resting sites' " for various species of aquatic wildlife. 474 U. S., at 134-135. For wetlands and "isolated" inland lakes, that interest &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*182&lt;/span&gt; is equally powerful, regardless of the proximity of the swamp or the water to a navigable stream. Nothing in the text, the stated purposes, or the legislative history of the CWA supports the conclusion that in 1972 Congress contemplated&#151;much less commanded&#151;the odd jurisdictional line that the Court has drawn today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority accuses respondents of reading the term "navigable" out of the statute. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 172. But that was accomplished by Congress when it deleted the word from the &#167; 502(7) definition. After all, it is the &lt;i&gt;definition&lt;/i&gt; that is the appropriate focus of our attention. &lt;i&gt;Babbitt&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.,&lt;/i&gt; 515 U. S. 687, 697-698, n. 10 (1995) (refusing to be guided by the common-law definition of the term "take" when construing that term within the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and looking instead to the meaning of the terms contained in the definition of "take" supplied by the statute). Moreover, a proper understanding of the history of federal water pollution regulation makes clear that&#151;even on respondents' broad reading&#151;the presence of the word "navigable" in the statute is not inexplicable. The term was initially used in the various Rivers and Harbors Acts because (1) at the time those statutes were first enacted, Congress' power over the Nation's waters was viewed as extending only to "water bodies that were deemed `navigable' and therefore suitable for moving goods to or from markets," Power 513; and (2) those statutes had the primary purpose of protecting navigation. Congress' choice to employ the term "navigable waters" in the 1972 Clean Water Act simply continued nearly a century of usage. Viewed in light of the history of federal water regulation, the broad &#167; 502(7) definition, and Congress' unambiguous instructions in the Conference Report, it is clear that the term "navigable waters" operates in the statute as a shorthand for "waters over which federal authority may properly be asserted."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*183&lt;/span&gt; II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the majority correctly notes, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 168, when the Corps first promulgated regulations pursuant to &#167; 404 of the 1972 Act, it construed its authority as being essentially the same as it had been under the 1899 RHA.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; The reaction to those regulations in the federal courts,&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; and in Congress&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; convinced &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*184&lt;/span&gt; the Corps that the statute required it "to protect water quality to the full extent of the [C]ommerce [C]lause" and to extend federal regulation over discharges "to many areas that have never before been subject to Federal permits or to this form of water quality protection." 40 Fed. Reg. 31320 (1975).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1975, the Corps therefore adopted the interim regulations that we upheld in &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview.&lt;/i&gt; As we noted in that case, the new regulations understood "the waters of the United States" to include, not only navigable waters and their tributaries, but also "nonnavigable intrastate waters whose use or misuse could affect interstate commerce." 474 U. S., at 123. The 1975 regulations provided that the new program would become effective in three phases: phase 1, which became effective immediately, encompassed the navigable waters covered by the 1974 regulation and the RHA; phase 2, effective after July 1, 1976, extended Corps jurisdiction to nonnavigable tributaries, freshwater wetlands adjacent to primary navigable waters, and lakes; and phase 3, effective after July 1, 1977, extended Corps jurisdiction to all other waters covered under the statute, including any waters not covered by phases 1 and 2 (such as "intermittent rivers, streams, tributaries, and perched wetlands that are not contiguous or adjacent to navigable waters") that "the District Engineer determines necessitate regulation for the protection of water quality." 40 Fed. Reg. 31325-31326 (1975). The final version of these regulations, adopted in 1977, made clear that the covered waters included "isolated lakes and wetlands, intermittent streams, prairie potholes, and other waters that are not part of a tributary system to interstate waters or to navigable waters of the United States, the degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate commerce."&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*185&lt;/span&gt; The Corps' broadened reading of its jurisdiction provoked opposition among some Members of Congress. As a result, in 1977, Congress considered a proposal that would have limited the Corps' jurisdiction under &#167; 404 to waters that are used, or by reasonable improvement could be used, as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce and their adjacent wetlands. H. R. 3199, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., &#167; 16(f) (1977). A bill embodying that proposal passed the House but was defeated in the Senate. The debates demonstrate that Congress was fully aware of the Corps' understanding of the scope of its jurisdiction under the 1972 Act. We summarized these debates in our opinion in &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In both Chambers, debate on the proposals to narrow the definition of navigable waters centered largely on the issue of wetlands preservation. See [123 Cong. Rec.], at 10426-10432 (House debate); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 26710-26729 (Senate debate). Proponents of a more limited &#167; 404 jurisdiction contended that the Corps' assertion of jurisdiction over wetlands and other nonnavigable `waters' had far exceeded what Congress had intended in enacting &#167; 404. Opponents of the proposed changes argued that a narrower definition of `navigable waters' for purposes of &#167; 404 would exclude vast stretches of crucial wetlands from the Corps' jurisdiction, with detrimental effects on wetlands ecosystems, water quality, and the aquatic environment generally. The debate, particularly in the Senate, was lengthy. In the House, the debate ended with the adoption of a narrowed definition of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*186&lt;/span&gt; `waters'; but in the Senate the limiting amendment was defeated and the old definition retained. The Conference Committee adopted the Senate's approach: efforts to narrow the definition of `waters' were abandoned; the legislation as ultimately passed, in the words of Senator Baker, `retain[ed] the comprehensive jurisdiction over the Nation's waters exercised in the 1972 Federal Water Pollution Control Act.' " 474 U. S., at 136-137.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net result of that extensive debate was a congressional endorsement of the position that the Corps maintains today. We explained in &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[T]he scope of the Corps' asserted jurisdiction over wetlands was specifically brought to Congress' attention, and Congress rejected measures designed to curb the Corps' jurisdiction in large part because of its concern that protection of wetlands would be unduly hampered by a narrowed definition of `navigable waters.' Although we are chary of attributing significance to Congress' failure to act, a refusal by Congress to overrule an agency's construction of legislation is at least some evidence of the reasonableness of that construction, particularly where the administrative construction has been brought to Congress' attention through legislation specifically designed to supplant it." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 137.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the majority were correct that Congress did not extend the Corps' jurisdiction in the 1972 CWA to reach beyond navigable waters and their nonnavigable tributaries, Congress' rejection of the House's efforts in 1977 to cut back on the Corps' 1975 assertion of jurisdiction clearly indicates congressional acquiescence in that assertion. Indeed, our broad determination in &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview&lt;/i&gt; that the 1977 Congress acquiesced in the very regulations at issue in this case should foreclose petitioner's present urgings to the contrary. The majority's refusal in today's decision to acknowledge the scope of our prior decision is troubling&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; Compare &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*187&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 136 ("Congress acquiesced in the [1975] administrative construction [of the Corps' jurisdiction]"), with &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 170 ("We conclude that respondents have failed to make the necessary showing that the failure of the 1977 House bill demonstrates Congress' acquiescence to the Corps' regulations. . .").&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt; Having already concluded that Congress acquiesced in the Corps' regulatory definition of its jurisdiction, the Court is wrong to reverse course today. See &lt;i&gt;Dickerson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000) (Rehnquist, C. J.) ("`[T]he doctrine [of &lt;i&gt;stare decisis&lt;/i&gt;] carries such persuasive force that we have always required a departure from precedent to be supported by some "special justification"` ").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More important than the 1977 bill that did not become law are the provisions that actually were included in the 1977 revisions. Instead of agreeing with those who sought to withdraw the Corps' jurisdiction over "isolated" waters, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*188&lt;/span&gt; Congress opted to exempt several classes of such waters from federal control. &#167; 67, 91 Stat. 1601, 33 U. S. C. &#167; 1344(f). For example, the 1977 amendments expressly exclude from the Corps' regulatory power the discharge of fill material "for the purpose of construction or maintenance of farm or stock ponds or irrigation ditches, or the maintenance of drainage ditches," and "for the purpose of construction of temporary sedimentation basins on a construction site which does not include placement of fill material into the navigable waters." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; The specific exemption of these waters from the Corps' jurisdiction indicates that the 1977 Congress recognized that similarly "isolated" waters &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; covered by the exceptions would fall within the statute's outer limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the enumerated exceptions, the 1977 amendments included a new section, &#167; 404(g), which authorized the States to administer their own permit programs over certain nonnavigable waters. Section 404(g)(1) provides, in relevant part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Governor of any State desiring to administer its own individual and general permit program for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters (other than those waters which are presently used, or are susceptible to use in their natural condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce . . . , including wetlands adjacent thereto) within its jurisdiction may submit to the Administrator a full and complete description of the program it proposes to establish and administer under State law or under an interstate compact." 33 U. S. C. &#167; 1344(g)(1).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 404(g)(1)'s reference to navigable waters "other than those waters which are presently used, or are susceptible to use," for transporting commerce and their adjacent wetlands appears to suggest that Congress viewed (and accepted) the Act's regulations as covering more than navigable &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*189&lt;/span&gt; waters in the traditional sense. The majority correctly points out that &#167; 404(g)(1) is itself ambiguous because it does not indicate precisely how far Congress considered federal jurisdiction to extend. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 171. But the Court ignores the provision's legislative history, which makes clear that Congress understood &#167; 404(g)(1)&#151;and therefore federal jurisdiction&#151;to extend, not only to navigable waters and nonnavigable tributaries, but also to "isolated" waters, such as those at issue in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conference Report discussing the 1977 amendments, for example, states that &#167; 404(g) "establish[es] a process to allow the Governor of any State to administer an individual and general permit program for the discharge of dredged or fill material into &lt;i&gt;phase 2 and 3 waters&lt;/i&gt; after the approval of a program by the Administrator." H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 95&#151; 830, p. 101 (1977), reprinted in 3 Legislative History of the Clean Water Act of 1977 (Committee Print compiled for the Committee on Environment and Public Works by the Library of Congress), Ser. No. 95-14, p. 285 (emphasis added) (hereinafter Leg. Hist. of CWA). Similarly, a Senate Report discussing the 1977 amendments explains that, under &#167; 404(g), "the [C]orps will &lt;i&gt;continue&lt;/i&gt; to administer the section 404 permit program in all navigable waters for a discharge of dredge or fill material until the approval of a State program &lt;i&gt;for phase 2 and 3 waters.&lt;/i&gt; " S. Rep. No. 95-370, p. 75 (1977), reprinted in 4 Leg. Hist. of CWA 708 (emphases added).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, as I have already discussed, "phase 1" waters are navigable waters and their contiguous wetlands, "phase 2" waters are the "primary tributaries" of navigable waters and their adjacent wetlands, and "phase 3" waters are all other waters covered by the statute, and can include such "isolated" waters as "intermittent rivers, streams, tributaries, and perched wetlands that are not contiguous or adjacent to navigable waters." The legislative history of the 1977 amendments therefore plainly establishes that, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*190&lt;/span&gt; when it enacted &#167; 404(g), Congress believed&#151;and desired&#151; the Corps' jurisdiction to extend beyond just navigable waters, their tributaries, and the wetlands adjacent to each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dismissing the significance of &#167; 404(g)(1), the majority quotes out of context language in the very same 1977 Senate Report that I have quoted above. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 170, n. 6. It is true that the Report states that "[t]he committee amendment does not &lt;i&gt;redefine&lt;/i&gt; navigable waters." S. Rep. No. 95&#151; 370, at 75, reprinted in 4 Leg. Hist. of CWA 708 (emphasis added). But the majority fails to point out that the quoted language appears in the course of an explanation of the Senate's refusal to go along with House efforts to &lt;i&gt;narrow the scope&lt;/i&gt; of the Corps' CWA jurisdiction to traditionally navigable waters. Thus, the immediately preceding sentence warns that "[t]o limit the jurisdiction of the [FWPCA] with reference to discharges of the pollutants of dredged or fill material would cripple efforts to achieve the act's objectives." &lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; The Court would do well to heed that warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority also places great weight, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 171, on our statement in &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview&lt;/i&gt; that &#167; 404(g) "does not &lt;i&gt;con-&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*191&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;clusively&lt;/i&gt; determine the construction to be placed on the use of the term `waters' elsewhere in the Act," 474 U. S., at 138, n. 11 (emphasis added). This is simply more selective reading. In that case, we also went on to say with respect to the significance of &#167; 404(g) that "the various provisions of the Act should be read &lt;i&gt;in pari materia.&lt;/i&gt; " &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Moreover, our ultimate conclusion in &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview&lt;/i&gt; was that &#167; 404(g) "suggest[s] strongly that the term `waters' as used in the Act" supports the Corps' reading. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it might have appeared problematic on a "linguistic" level for the Corps to classify "lands" as "waters" in &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview,&lt;/i&gt; 474 U. S., at 131-132, we squarely held that the agency's construction of the statute that it was charged with enforcing was entitled to deference under &lt;i&gt;Chevron U. S. A. Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 837 (1984). Today, however, the majority refuses to extend such deference to the same agency's construction of the same statute, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 172-174. This refusal is unfaithful to both &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Chevron.&lt;/i&gt;  For it is the majority's reading, not the agency's, that does violence to the scheme Congress chose to put into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the Court's suggestion, the Corps' interpretation of the statute does not "encroac[h]" upon "traditional state power" over land use. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 173. "Land use planning in essence chooses particular uses for the land; environmental regulation, at its core, does not mandate particular uses of the land but requires only that, however the land is used, damage to the environment is kept within prescribed limits." &lt;i&gt;California Coastal Comm'n&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Granite Rock Co.,&lt;/i&gt;  480 U. S. 572, 587 (1987). The CWA is not a land-use code; it is a paradigm of environmental regulation. Such regulation is an accepted exercise of federal power. &lt;i&gt;Hodel&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Virginia Surface Mining &amp;amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 452 U. S. 264, 282 (1981).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*192&lt;/span&gt; It is particularly ironic for the Court to raise the specter of federalism while construing a statute that makes explicit efforts to foster local control over water regulation. Faced with calls to cut back on federal jurisdiction over water pollution, Congress rejected attempts to narrow the scope of that jurisdiction and, by incorporating &#167; 404(g), opted instead for a scheme that encouraged States to supplant federal control with their own regulatory programs. S. Rep. No. 95-370, at 75, reprinted in 4 Leg. Hist. of CWA 708 ("The committee amendment does not redefine navigable waters. Instead, the committee amendment intends to assure continued protection of &lt;i&gt;all the Nation's waters,&lt;/i&gt; but allows States to assume the primary responsibility for protecting those lakes, rivers, streams, swamps, marshes, and other portions of the navigable waters outside the [C]orps program in the so-called phase I waters" (emphasis added)). Because Illinois could have taken advantage of the opportunities offered to it through &#167; 404(g), the federalism concerns to which the majority adverts are misplaced. The Corps' interpretation of the statute as extending beyond navigable waters, tributaries of navigable waters, and wetlands adjacent to each is manifestly reasonable and therefore entitled to deference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I am convinced that the Court's miserly construction of the statute is incorrect, I shall comment briefly on petitioner's argument that Congress is without power to prohibit it from filling any part of the 31 acres of ponds on its property in Cook County, Illinois. The Corps' exercise of its &#167; 404 permitting power over "isolated" waters that serve as habitat for migratory birds falls well within the boundaries set by this Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lopez,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S. 549, 558-559 (1995), this Court identified "three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power": (1) channels of interstate commerce; (2) instrumentalities of interstate &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*193&lt;/span&gt; commerce, or persons and things in interstate commerce; and (3) activities that "substantially affect" interstate commerce. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; The migratory bird rule at issue here is properly analyzed under the third category. In order to constitute a proper exercise of Congress' power over intrastate activities that "substantially affect" interstate commerce, it is not necessary that each individual instance of the activity substantially affect commerce; it is enough that, taken in the aggregate, the &lt;i&gt;class of activities&lt;/i&gt; in question has such an effect. &lt;i&gt;Perez&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 402 U. S. 146 (1971) (noting that it is the "class" of regulated activities, not the individual instance, that is to be considered in the "affects" commerce analysis); see also &lt;i&gt;Hodel,&lt;/i&gt; 452 U. S., at 277; &lt;i&gt;Wickard&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Filburn,&lt;/i&gt; 317 U. S. 111, 127-128 (1942).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activity being regulated in this case (and by the Corps' &#167; 404 regulations in general) is the discharge of fill material into water. The Corps did not assert jurisdiction over petitioner's land simply because the waters were "used as habitat by migratory birds." It asserted jurisdiction because petitioner planned to &lt;i&gt;discharge fill&lt;/i&gt; into waters "used as habitat by migratory birds." Had petitioner intended to engage in some other activity besides discharging fill (&lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; had there been no activity to regulate), or, conversely, had the waters not been habitat for migratory birds (&lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; had there been no basis for federal jurisdiction), the Corps would never have become involved in petitioner's use of its land. There can be no doubt that, unlike the class of activities Congress was attempting to regulate in &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Morrison,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S. 598, 613 (2000) ("[g]endermotivated crimes"), and &lt;i&gt;Lopez,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S., at 561 (possession of guns near school property), the discharge of fill material into the Nation's waters is almost always undertaken for economic reasons. See V. Albrecht &amp;amp; B. Goode, Wetland Regulation in the Real World, Exh. 3 (Feb. 1994) (demonstrating that the overwhelming majority of acreage for which &#167; 404 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*194&lt;/span&gt; permits are sought is intended for commercial, industrial, or other economic use).&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, no one disputes that the discharge of fill into "isolated" waters that serve as migratory bird habitat will, in the aggregate, adversely affect migratory bird populations. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 1 Secretary of the Interior, Report to Congress, The Impact of Federal Programs on Wetlands: The Lower Mississippi Alluvial Plain and the Prairie Pothole Region 79-80 (Oct. 1988) (noting that "isolated," phase 3 waters "are among the most important and also [the] most threatened ecosystems in the United States" because "[t]hey are prime nesting grounds for many species of North American waterfowl . . ." and provide "[u]p to 50 percent of the [U. S.] production of migratory waterfowl"). Nor does petitioner dispute that the particular waters it seeks to fill are home to many important species of migratory birds, including the second-largest breeding colony of Great Blue Herons in northeastern Illinois, App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a, and several species of waterfowl protected by international treaty and Illinois endangered species laws, Brief for Federal Respondents 7.&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the intrinsic value of migratory birds, see &lt;i&gt;Missouri&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Holland,&lt;/i&gt; 252 U. S. 416, 435 (1920) (noting the importance of migratory birds as "protectors of our forests and our crops" and as "a food supply"), it is undisputed that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*195&lt;/span&gt; literally millions of people regularly participate in birdwatching and hunting and that those activities generate a host of commercial activities of great value.&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt; The causal connection between the filling of wetlands and the decline of commercial activities associated with migratory birds is not "attenuated," &lt;i&gt;Morrison,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S., at 612; it is direct and concrete. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Gibbs&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Babbitt,&lt;/i&gt; 214 F. 3d 483, 492-493 (CA4 2000) ("The relationship between red wolf takings and interstate commerce is quite direct&#151;with no red wolves, there will be no red wolf related tourism . . .").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the migratory bird rule does not blur the "distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local." &lt;i&gt;Morrison,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S., at 617-618. Justice Holmes cogently observed in &lt;i&gt;Missouri&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Holland&lt;/i&gt; that the protection of migratory birds is a textbook example of a &lt;i&gt;national&lt;/i&gt; problem. 252 U. S., at 435 ("It is not sufficient to rely upon the States [to protect migratory birds]. The reliance is vain . . ."). The destruction of aquatic migratory bird habitat, like so many other environmental problems, is an action in which the benefits (&lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; a new landfill) are disproportionately local, while many of the costs (&lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; fewer migratory birds) are widely dispersed and often borne by citizens living in other States. In such situations, described by economists as involving "externalities," federal regulation is both appropriate and necessary. Revesz, Rehabilitating Interstate &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*196&lt;/span&gt; Competition: Rethinking the "Race-to-the-Bottom" Rationale for Federal Environmental Regulation, 67 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1210, 1222 (1992) ("The presence of interstate externalities is a powerful reason for intervention at the federal level"); cf. &lt;i&gt;Hodel,&lt;/i&gt; 452 U. S., at 281-282 (deferring to Congress' finding that nationwide standards were "essential" in order to avoid "destructive interstate competition" that might undermine environmental standards). Identifying the Corps' jurisdiction by reference to waters that serve as habitat for birds that migrate over state lines also satisfies this Court's expressed desire for some "jurisdictional element" that limits federal activity to its proper scope. &lt;i&gt;Morrison,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S., at 612.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power to regulate commerce among the several States necessarily and properly includes the power to preserve the natural resources that generate such commerce. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Sporhase&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Nebraska ex rel. Douglas,&lt;/i&gt; 458 U. S. 941, 953 (1982) (holding water to be an "article of commerce"). Migratory birds, and the waters on which they rely, are such resources. Moreover, the protection of migratory birds is a wellestablished federal responsibility. As Justice Holmes noted in &lt;i&gt;Missouri&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Holland&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; the federal interest in protecting these birds is of "the first magnitude." 252 U. S., at 435. Because of their transitory nature, they "can be protected only by national action." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it is necessary or appropriate to refuse to allow petitioner to fill those ponds is a question on which we have no voice. Whether the Federal Government has the power to require such permission, however, is a question that is easily answered. If, as it does, the Commerce Clause empowers Congress to regulate particular "activities causing air or water pollution, or other environmental hazards that may have effects in more than one State," &lt;i&gt;Hodel,&lt;/i&gt; 452 U. S., at 282, it also empowers Congress to control individual actions that, in the aggregate, would have the same effect. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*197&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Perez,&lt;/i&gt; 402 U. S., at 154; &lt;i&gt;Wickard,&lt;/i&gt; 317 U. S., at 127-128.&lt;sup&gt;[18]&lt;/sup&gt; There is no merit in petitioner's constitutional argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

Blase;&lt;/i&gt;  and for Dr. Gene Likens et al. by &lt;i&gt;Michael Bean.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The Corps issued the "Migratory Bird Rule" without following the notice and comment procedures outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. &#167; 553.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Relying upon its earlier decision in &lt;i&gt;Hoffman Homes, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;EPA,&lt;/i&gt; 999 F. 2d 256 (CA7 1993), and a report from the United States Census Bureau, the Court of Appeals found that in 1996 approximately 3.1 million Americans spent $1.3 billion to hunt migratory birds (with 11 percent crossing state lines to do so) as another 17.7 million Americans observed migratory birds (with 9.5 million traveling for the purpose of observing shorebirds). See 191 F. 3d, at 850.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Respondents refer us to portions of the legislative history that they believe indicate Congress' intent to expand the definition of "navigable waters." Although the Conference Report includes the statement that the conferees "intend that the term `navigable waters' be given the broadest possible constitutional interpretation," S. Conf. Rep. No. 92-1236, p. 144 (1972),neither this,nor anything else in the legislative history to which respondents point, signifies that Congress intended to exert anything more than its commerce power over navigation. Indeed, respondents admit that the legislative history is somewhat ambiguous. See Brief for Federal Respondents 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  While this bill passed in the House, a similarly worded amendment to a bill originating in the Senate, S. 1952, failed. See 123 Cong. Rec. 26710, 26728 (1977).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  In &lt;i&gt;Bob Jones Univ.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 461 U. S. 574, 595, 600-601 (1983), for example, we upheld an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Revenue Ruling that revoked the tax-exempt status of private schools practicing racial discrimination because the IRS' interpretation of the relevant statutes was "correct"; because Congress had held "hearings on this precise issue," making it "hardly conceivable that Congress&#151;and in this setting, any Member of Congress&#151;was not abundantly aware of what was going on"; and because "no fewer than 13 bills introduced to overturn the IRS interpretation" had failed. Absent such overwhelming evidence of acquiescence, we are loath to replace the plain text and original understanding of a statute with an amended agency interpretation. See &lt;i&gt;Consumer Product Safety Comm'n&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;GTE Sylvania, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 447 U. S. 102, 118, n. 13 (1980) ("[E]ven when it would otherwise be useful, subsequent legislative history will rarely override a reasonable interpretation of a statute that can be gleaned from its language and legislative history prior to its enactment").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  Respondents cite, for example, the Senate Report on S. 1952, which referred to the Corps' "isolated waters" regulation. See S. Rep. No. 95&#151; 370, p. 75 (1977). However, the same report reiterated that "[t]he committee amendment does not redefine navigable waters." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  Respondents also make a passing reference to Congress' decision in 1977 to exempt certain types of discharges from &#167; 404(a),including, for example, "discharge of dredged or fill material . .. for the purpose of construction or maintenance of farm or stock ponds or irrigation ditches, or the maintenance of drainage ditches." &#167; 67,91 Stat. 1600, 33 U. S. C. &#167; 1344(f)(C). As &#167; 404(a) only regulates dredged or fill material that is discharged "into navigable waters," Congress' decision to exempt certain types of these discharges does not affect, much less address, the definition of "navigable waters."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  Because violations of the CWA carry criminal penalties, see 33 U. S. C. &#167; 1319(c)(2), petitioner invokes the rule of lenity as another basis for rejecting the Corps' interpretation of the CWA. Brief for Petitioner 31-32. We need not address this alternative argument. See &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Shabani,&lt;/i&gt; 513 U. S. 10, 17 (1994).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  See R. Adler, J.Landman, &amp;amp; D. Cameron, The Clean Water Act: 20 Years Later 5-10 (1993).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  See also App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a, and Brief for United States 8, n. 7, in &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview,&lt;/i&gt; O. T. 1984, No. 84-701. The District Court in &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview&lt;/i&gt; found that there was no direct "hydrological" connection between the parcel at issue and any nearby navigable waters. App. to Pet. for Cert. in &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview&lt;/i&gt; 25a. The wetlands characteristics of the parcel were due, not to a surface or groundwater connection to any actually navigable water, but to "poor drainage" resulting from "the Lamson soil that underlay the property." Brief for Respondent in &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview&lt;/i&gt; 7. Nevertheless, this Court found occasional surface runoff from the property into nearby waters to constitute a meaningful connection. &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview,&lt;/i&gt; 474 U. S., at 134; Brief for United States in &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview&lt;/i&gt; 8, n. 7. Of course, the &lt;i&gt;ecological&lt;/i&gt; connection between the wetlands and the nearby waters also played a central role in this Court's decision. &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview,&lt;/i&gt; 474 U. S., at 134-135. Both types of connection are also present in many, and possibly most, "isolated" waters. Brief for Dr. Gene Likens et al. as &lt;i&gt;Amici Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 6-22. Indeed, although the majority and petitioner both refer to the waters on petitioner's site as "isolated," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 172; Brief for Petitioner 11, their role as habitat for migratory birds, birds that serve important functions in the ecosystems of other waters throughout North America, suggests that&#151;ecologically speaking&#151;the waters at issue in this case are anything but isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  See also Rivers and Harbors Appropriations Act of 1896, 29 Stat. 234; River and Harbor Act of 1894, 28 Stat. 363; River and Harbor Appropriations Act of 1890, 26 Stat. 426; The River and Harbor Appropriations Act of 1886, 24 Stat. 329.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  In 1970, the House Committee on Government Operations followed the Court's lead and advocated the use of &#167; 13 as a pollution control provision. H. R. Rep. No. 91-917, pp. 14-18 (1970). President Nixon responded by issuing Executive Order No. 11574, 35 Fed. Reg. 19627 (1970) (revoked by Exec. Order No. 12553, 51 Fed. Reg. 7237 (1986)), which created the Refuse Act Permit Program. Power, The Fox in the Chicken Coop: The Regulatory Program of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, 63 Va. L. Rev. 503, 512 (1977) (hereinafter Power). The program ended soon after it started, however, when a District Court, reading the language of &#167; 13 literally, held the permit program invalid. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.;&lt;/i&gt; see &lt;i&gt;Kalur&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Resor,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/dcd/9UNL/kalur-v-resor/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;335&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 9 (DC 1971).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  The FWPCA of 1948 applied only to "interstate waters." &#167; 10(e), 62 Stat. 1161. Subsequently, it was harmonized with the Rivers and Harbors Act such that&#151;like the earlier statute&#151;the FWPCA defined its jurisdiction with reference to "navigable waters." Pub. L. 89-753, &#167; 211, 80 Stat. 1252. None of these early versions of the FWPCA could fairly be described as establishing a comprehensive approach to the problem, but they did contain within themselves several of the elements that would later be employed in the CWA. &lt;i&gt;Milwaukee&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Illinois,&lt;/i&gt; 451 U. S. 304, 318, n. 10 (1981) (Rehnquist, J.) (Congress intended to do something "quite different" in the 1972 Act); 2 W. Rodgers, Environmental Law: Air and Water &#167; 4.1, pp. 10-11 (1986) (describing the early versions of the FWPCA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  The definition of "navigable water" in earlier versions of the FWPCA had made express reference to navigability. &#167; 211, 80 Stat. 1253.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  The version adopted by the House of Representatives defined "navigable waters" as "the navigable waters of the United States, including the territorial seas." H. R. 11896, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., &#167; 502(8) (1971), reprinted in 1 Leg. Hist. 1069. The CWA ultimately defined "navigable waters" simply as "the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas." 33 U. S. C. &#167; 1362(7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  The Corps later acknowledged that the 1974 regulations "limited the Section 404 permit program to the same waters that were being regulated under the River and Harbor Act of 1899." 42 Fed. Reg. 37123 (1977). Although refusing to defer to the Corps' &lt;i&gt;present&lt;/i&gt; interpretation of the statute, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 172, the majority strangely attributes some significance to the Corps' &lt;i&gt;initial&lt;/i&gt; reluctance to read the 1972 Act as expanding its jurisdiction, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 168 ("Respondents put forward no persuasive evidence that the Corps mistook Congress' intent in 1974"). But, stranger still, by construing the statute as extending to nonnavigable tributaries and adjacent wetlands, the majority reads the statute more broadly than the 1974 regulations that it seems willing to accept as a correct construction of the Corps' jurisdiction. As I make clear in the text, there is abundant evidence that the Corps was wrong in 1974 and that the Court is wrong today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9]  See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Natural Resources Defense Council&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Callaway,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/dcd/96Ms/natural-resources-defense-council-inc-v-callaway/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;392&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;685&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 686 (DC 1975); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Holland,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/flmd/bKHJ/united-states-v-holland/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;373&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;665&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (MD Fla. 1974).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[10]  In a 1974 letter to the head of the Corps, the EPA Administrator expressed his disagreement with the Corps' parsimonious view of its own jurisdiction under the CWA. Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972: Hearings before the Senate Committee on Public Works, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., 349 (1976) (letter dated June 19, 1974, from Russell E. Train, Administrator of EPA, to Lt. Gen. W. C. Gribble, Jr., Chief of Corps of Engineers). The EPA is the agency that generally administers the CWA, except as otherwise provided. 33 U. S. C. &#167; 1251(d); see also 43 Op. Atty. Gen. 197 (1979) ("Congress intended to confer upon the administrator of the [EPA] the final administrative authority" to determine the reach of the term "navigable waters").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[11]  The House Committee on Government Operations noted the disagreement between the EPA and the Corps over the meaning of "navigable waters" and ultimately expressed its agreement with the EPA's broader reading of the statute. H. R. Rep. No. 93-1396, pp. 23-27 (1974).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[12]  42 Fed. Reg. 37127 (1977),as amended, 33 CFR &#167; 328.3(a)(3)(1977). The so-called "migratory bird" rule, upon which the Corps based its assertion of jurisdiction in this case, is merely a specific application of the more general jurisdictional definition first adopted in the 1975 and 1977 rules. The "rule," which operates as a rule of thumb for identifying the waters that fall within the Corps' jurisdiction over phase 3 waters, first appeared in the preamble to a 1986 repromulgation of the Corps' definition of "navigable waters." 51 Fed. Reg. 41217 (1986). As the Corps stated in the preamble, this repromulgation was not intended to alter its jurisdiction in any way. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Instead, the Corps indicated, the migratory bird rule was enacted simply to "clarif[y]" the scope of existing jurisdictional regulations. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[13]  The majority appears to believe that its position is consistent with &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview&lt;/i&gt; because of that case's reservation of the question whether the Corps' jurisdiction extends to "certain wetlands not necessarily adjacent to other waters," 474 U. S., at 124, n. 2. But it is clear from the context that the question reserved by &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview&lt;/i&gt; did not concern "isolated" &lt;i&gt;waters,&lt;/i&gt; such as those at issue in this case, but rather "isolated" &lt;i&gt;wetlands.&lt;/i&gt; See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 131-132, n. 8 ("We are not called upon to address the question of the authority of the Corps to regulate discharges of fill material into wetlands that are not adjacent to bodies of open water . . ."). Unlike the open waters present on petitioner's site, wetlands are &lt;i&gt;lands&lt;/i&gt; "that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas." 33 CFR &#167; 328.3(b) (2000). If, as I believe, actually navigable waters lie at the very heart of Congress' commerce power and "isolated," nonnavigable waters lie closer to (but well within) the margin, "isolated wetlands," which are themselves only marginally "waters," are the most marginal category of "waters of the United States" potentially covered by the statute. It was the question of the extension of federal jurisdiction to &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; category of "waters" that the &lt;i&gt;Riverside Bayview&lt;/i&gt; Court reserved. That question is not presented in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[14]  In any event, to attach significance to the Report's statement that the committee amendments do not "redefine navigable waters," one must first accept the majority's erroneous interpretation of the 1972 Act. But the very Report upon which the majority relies states that "[t]he 1972 [FWPCA] exercised &lt;i&gt;comprehensive jurisdiction&lt;/i&gt; over the &lt;i&gt;Nation's waters&lt;/i&gt;  to control pollution to the &lt;i&gt;fullest constitutional extent.&lt;/i&gt; " S. Rep. No. 95&#151; 370, at 75, reprinted in 4 Leg. Hist. of CWA 708 (emphases added). Even if the Court's flawed reading of the earlier statute were correct, however, the language to which the Court points does not counsel against finding congressional acquiescence in the Corps' 1975 regulations. Quite the contrary. From the perspective of the 1977 Congress, those regulations constituted the status quo that the proposed amendments sought to alter. Considering the Report's favorable references to the Corps' "continu[ing]" jurisdiction over phase 2 and 3 waters, the language concerning the failure of the amendments to "redefine navigable waters" cuts strongly against the majority's position, which instead completely excises phase 3 waters from the scope of the Act. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[15]  The fact that petitioner can conceive of some people who may discharge fill for noneconomic reasons does not weaken the legitimacy of the Corps' jurisdictional claims. As we observed in &lt;i&gt;Perez&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt;  402 U. S. 146 (1971), "[w]here the &lt;i&gt;class of activities&lt;/i&gt; is regulated and that &lt;i&gt;class&lt;/i&gt; is within the reach of federal power, the courts have no power to excise, as trivial, individual instances of the class." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 154 (internal quotation marks omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[16]  Other bird species using petitioner's site as habitat include the "`Great Egret, Green-backed Heron, Black-crowned Night Heron, Canada Goose, Wood Duck, Mallard, Greater Yellow legs, Belted Kingfisher, Northern Waterthrush, Louisiana Waterthrush, Swamp Sparrow, and Red-winged Blackbird.'" Brief for Petitioner 4, n. 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[17]  In 1984, the U. S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment found that, in 1980, 5.3 million Americans hunted migratory birds, spending $638 million. U. S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, Wetlands: Their Use and Regulation 54 (OTA&#151;O-206, Mar. 1984). More than 100 million Americans spent almost $14.8 billion in 1980 to watch and photograph fish and wildlife. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Of 17.7 million bird watchers, 14.3 million took trips in order to observe, feed, or photograph waterfowl, and 9.5 million took trips specifically to view other water-associated birds, such as herons like those residing at petitioner's site. U. S. Dept. of Interior, U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, 1996 National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation 45, 90 (issued Nov. 1997).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[18]  Justice Thomas is the only Member of the Court who has expressed disagreement with the "aggregation principle." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lopez,&lt;/i&gt;  514 U. S. 549, 600 (1995) (concurring opinion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;No. 99-1680.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;United States Supreme Court.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued November 28, 2000.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided January 17, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF WISCONSIN
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*279&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*280&lt;/span&gt; Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jeff Scott Olson&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Richard L. Wilson, John H. Weston, G. Randall Garrou,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cathy E. Crosson.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Curt R. Meitz&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Vincent D. Moschella&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Thomas C. Goldstein.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;James A. Feldman&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging affirmance. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Ogden, Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler, Lisa Schiavo Blatt, Michael Jay Singer,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Howard S. Scher.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Ginsburg, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Freedman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maryland,&lt;/i&gt; 380 U. S. 51 (1965), a case involving a state motion-picture censorship scheme, the Court announced procedural requirements necessary to guard against unconstitutional prior restraint of expression. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*281&lt;/span&gt; Those requirements included assurance of "a prompt final judicial decision, to minimize the deterrent effect of an interim and possibly erroneous denial of a license." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 59. Twenty-five years later, in &lt;i&gt;FW/PBS, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dallas,&lt;/i&gt; 493 U. S. 215 (1990), the Court applied some of the &lt;i&gt;Freedman&lt;/i&gt; standards to a municipal ordinance conditioning the operation of sexually oriented businesses on receipt of a license. Unsuccessful applicants for an adult business license, the opinion announcing the judgment stated, must be accorded "an avenue for prompt judicial review." 493 U. S., at 229.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courts have divided over the meaning of &lt;i&gt;FW/PBS&lt;/i&gt; `s "prompt judicial review" requirement. Some have held that the unsuccessful applicant for an adult business license must be assured a prompt judicial determination on the merits of the permit denial. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baby Tam &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Las Vegas,&lt;/i&gt;  154 F. 3d 1097, 1101-1102 (CA9 1998); &lt;i&gt;11126 Baltimore Blvd., Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Prince George's County,&lt;/i&gt; 58 F. 3d 988, 999-1000 (CA4 1995) (en banc). Others, like the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin whose judgment is before us, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/wisctapp/9h3p/city-news-novelty-inc-v-city-of-waukesha/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;231&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wis. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;93&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 115-116, 604 N. W. 2d 870, 882 (1999), have held that prompt access to court review suffices. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Boss Capital, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Casselberry,&lt;/i&gt; 187 F. 3d 1251, 1256-1257 (CA11 1999); &lt;i&gt;TK's Video, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Denton County,&lt;/i&gt; 24 F. 3d 705, 709 (CA5 1994). We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 530 U. S. 1242 (2000). We now find, however, that the issue stemming from &lt;i&gt;Freedman&lt;/i&gt; is not genuinely presented to us in this case. We therefore dismiss the petition and leave the judgment of the Wisconsin court undisturbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City of Waukesha, Wisconsin (City), requires sellers of sexually explicit materials to obtain and annually renew adult business licenses. See Waukesha Municipal Code &#167;&#167; 8.195(2), (7) (1995), reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. 101, 104. Petitioner City News and Novelty, Inc. (City News), pursuant to a City license first obtained in 1989, owned and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*282&lt;/span&gt; operated an adult-oriented shop in downtown Waukesha. In November 1995, City News applied for a renewal of its license, then due to expire in two months. In December 1995, Waukesha's Common Council denied the application, finding that City News had violated the City's ordinance by permitting minors to loiter on the premises, failing to maintain an unobstructed view of booths in the store, and allowing patrons to engage in sexual activity inside the booths. Waukesha's refusal to renew City News's license was upheld in administrative proceedings and on judicial review in the state courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioning for certiorari, City News raised three questions. First, City News asserted that the persuasion burden had been improperly assigned to it. Second, City News urged that Waukesha's ordinance unconstitutionally accorded City officials unbridled discretion to vary punishments for ordinance violations. Third, City News asked us to "resolve the conflict among the circuits concerning whether the guarantee of prompt judicial review that must accompany [an adult business] licensing scheme means a prompt judicial determination or simply the right to promptly file for judicial review." Pet. for Cert. 13. We granted the petition only on the third question. Accordingly, City News cannot now contend that any of the substantive requirements governing adult business licenses in Waukesha conflict with the First Amendment. Nor does City News contend that the evidence failed to substantiate the charged violations. We now explain why City News is not properly situated to raise the question on which we granted review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In letters sent to Waukesha two months after petitioning for review in this Court, City News gave notice that it would withdraw its renewal application and close its business upon the City's grant of a license to another corporation, B. J. B., Inc., "a larger and more modern business" with which City &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*283&lt;/span&gt; News felt "it [could not] effectively compete." Letters from Jeff Scott Olson to Vince Moschella (June 12 and 19, 2000), Respondent's Lodging, Vol. 1, Tab No. 14. Waukesha granted B. J. B.'s license application on June 20. It is undisputed that City News has ceased to operate as an adult business and no longer seeks to renew its license. Tr. of Oral Arg. 14-15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observing that City News neither now pursues nor currently expresses an intent to pursue a license under Waukesha law, Waukesha asserts that the case has become moot, for City News no longer has "a legally cognizable interest in the outcome." &lt;i&gt;County of Los Angeles&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Davis,&lt;/i&gt; 440 U. S. 625, 631 (1979) (citing &lt;i&gt;Powell&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McCormack,&lt;/i&gt; 395 U. S. 486, 496 (1969)). We agree that the case no longer qualifies for judicial review. Urging that the case remains fit for adjudication, City News tenders two points. We find neither persuasive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noting that it "has never promised not to apply for a license" in the future, Reply Brief 1, City News first contends that, notwithstanding the voluntary termination of its license renewal effort, a live controversy remains under the Court's reasoning in &lt;i&gt;Erie&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pap's A. M.,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S. 277 (2000). In our view, &lt;i&gt;Erie&lt;/i&gt; differs critically from this case. In &lt;i&gt;Erie,&lt;/i&gt; we similarly granted a petition to review a state-court judgment addressing an adult business' First Amendment challenge to a city ordinance. We concluded that the controversy persisted, even though the adult business had shut down. We reached that conclusion, it is true, in part because the business "could again decide to operate." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 287. That speculation standing alone, however, did not shield the case from a mootness determination. Another factor figured prominently. The nude dancing entrepreneur in &lt;i&gt;Erie&lt;/i&gt;  sought "to have the case declared moot" after the business had "prevailed below," obtaining a judgment that invalidated Erie's ordinance. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 288. Had we accepted the entrepreneur's plea, then consistent with our practice when a case &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*284&lt;/span&gt; becomes moot on review from a state court, we would have dismissed the petition, leaving intact the judgment below. See &lt;i&gt;ASARCO Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kadish,&lt;/i&gt; 490 U. S. 605, 621, n. 1 (1989); &lt;i&gt;Erie,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S., at 305 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). Thus, had we declared &lt;i&gt;Erie&lt;/i&gt; moot, the defendant municipality would have been saddled with an "ongoing injury," &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; the judgment striking its law. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 288. And the plaintiff arguably would have prevailed in an "attemp[t] to manipulate the Court's jurisdiction to insulate a favorable decision from review." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we confront no parallel circumstance. The adult enterprise before us left the fray as a loser, not a winner. Our dismissal here does not keep Waukesha under the weight of an adverse judgment, or deprive Waukesha of its victory in state court. Nor does a mootness dismissal reward an arguable manipulation of our jurisdiction, for plaintiff City News, unlike the nude dancing entrepreneur in &lt;i&gt;Erie,&lt;/i&gt; opposes a declaration of mootness.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City News also urges that it experiences ongoing injury because it is conclusively barred by Waukesha's ordinance from reopening as an adult business until 2005. It is far &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*285&lt;/span&gt; from clear, however, whether City News actually suffers that disability.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; And as our prior discussion suggests, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 283, a live controversy is not maintained by speculation that City News might be temporarily disabled from reentering a business that City News has left and currently asserts no plan to reenter. See &lt;i&gt;Spencer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kemna,&lt;/i&gt; 523 U. S. 1, 15-16 (1998).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City News's contention that it remains a qualified complainant also fails for a separate reason. Full briefing and argument have revealed that the question City News tendered, and which we took up for review, is not now and never was accurately reflective of City News's grievance. Unlike the initial license applicant whose expression cannot begin prepermission (the situation of the complainant in &lt;i&gt;Freedman&lt;/i&gt; ), City News was already licensed to conduct an adult business and sought to fend off a stop order. Swift judicial review is the remedy needed by those held back from speaking. We do not doubt that an ongoing adult enterprise facing loss of its license to do business may allege First Amendment injuries. Such an establishment's typical concern, however, is not the speed of court proceedings, but the availability &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*286&lt;/span&gt; of a stay of adverse action during the pendency of judicial review, however long that review takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the petitioner in &lt;i&gt;Freedman,&lt;/i&gt; who sought, through swift court review, an end to the status quo of silence, City News sought to maintain, &lt;i&gt;pendente lite,&lt;/i&gt; the status quo of speech (or expressive conduct). Brief for Petitioner 43-44. We venture no view on the merits of an argument urging preservation of speech (or expressive conduct) as the status quo pending administrative and judicial review proceedings. It suffices to point out that the question is not the one on which the courts have divided or on which we granted certiorari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;For the reasons stated, the writ of certiorari is &lt;i&gt;Dismissed.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*251&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*252&lt;/span&gt; O'Connor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined. Scalia, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Souter, J., joined, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt;  p. 267. Thomas, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt;  p. 270. Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 274.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Maureen Hart,&lt;/i&gt; Senior Assistant Attorney General of Washington, argued the cause for petitioner. With her on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Christine O. Gregoire,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, &lt;i&gt;Sarah Blackman Sappington,&lt;/i&gt; Assistant Attorney General, &lt;i&gt;David J. W. Hackett,&lt;/i&gt; Special Assistant Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;William Berggren Collins,&lt;/i&gt; Senior Assistant Attorney General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Robert C. Boruchowitz&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;David B. Hirsch, Dennis P. Carroll,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Christine Jackson.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*253&lt;/span&gt; Justice O'Connor, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington State's Community Protection Act of 1990 authorizes the civil commitment of "sexually violent predators," persons who suffer from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes them likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence. Wash. Rev. Code &#167; 71.09.010 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; (1992). Respondent, Andre Brigham Young, is confined as a sexually violent predator at the Special Commitment Center (Center), for which petitioner is the superintendent. After respondent's challenges to his commitment in state court proved largely unsuccessful, he instituted a habeas action under 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2254, seeking release from confinement. The Washington Supreme Court had already held that the Act is civil, &lt;i&gt;In re Young,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/wash/6Kop/matter-of-personal-restraint-of-young/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;122&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wash. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 857 P. 2d 989 (1993) (en banc), and this Court held a similar commitment scheme for sexually violent predators in Kansas to be civil on its face, &lt;i&gt;Kansas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hendricks,&lt;/i&gt; 521 U. S. 346 (1997). The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit nevertheless concluded that respondent could challenge the statute as being punitive "as applied" to him in violation of the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*254&lt;/span&gt; Double Jeopardy and &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clauses, and remanded the case to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington State's Community Protection Act of 1990 (Act) was a response to citizens' concerns about laws and procedures regarding sexually violent offenders. One of the Act's provisions authorizes civil commitment of such offenders. Wash. Rev. Code &#167; 71.09.010 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; (1992 and Supp. 2000). The Act defines a sexually violent predator as someone who has been convicted of, or charged with, a crime of sexual violence and who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility. &#167; 71.09.020(1) (Supp. 2000). The statute reaches prisoners, juveniles, persons found incompetent to stand trial, persons found not guilty by reason of insanity, and persons at any time convicted of a sexually violent offense who have committed a recent overt act. &#167; 71.09.030. Generally, when it appears that a person who has committed a sexually violent offense is about to be released from confinement, the prosecuting attorney files a petition alleging that that person is a sexually violent predator. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; That filing triggers a process for charging and trying the person as a sexually violent predator, during which he is afforded a panoply of protections including counsel and experts (paid for by the State in cases of indigency), a probable cause hearing, and trial by judge or jury at the individual's option. &#167;&#167; 71.09.040-71.09.050. At trial, the State bears the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person is a sexually violent predator. &#167; 71.09.060(1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon the finding that a person is a sexually violent predator, he is committed for control, care, and treatment to the custody of the department of social and health services. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Once confined, the person has a right to adequate care &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*255&lt;/span&gt; and individualized treatment. &#167; 71.09.080(2). The person is also entitled to an annual examination of his mental condition. &#167; 71.09.070. If that examination indicates that the individual's condition is so changed that he is not likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence, state officials must authorize the person to petition the court for conditional release or discharge. &#167; 71.09.090(1). The person is entitled to a hearing at which the State again bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that he is not safe to be at large. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; The person may also independently petition the court for release. &#167; 71.09.090(2). At a show cause hearing, if the court finds probable cause to believe that the person is no longer dangerous, a full hearing will be held at which the State again bears the burden of proof. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Act also provides a procedure to petition for conditional release to a less restrictive alternative to confinement. &#167; 71.09.090. Before ordering conditional release, the court must find that the person will be treated by a state certified sexual offender treatment provider, that there is a specific course of treatment, that housing exists that will be sufficiently secure to protect the community, and that the person is willing to comply with the treatment and supervision requirements. &#167; 71.09.092. Conditional release is subject to annual review until the person is unconditionally released. &#167;&#167; 71.09.096, 71.09.098.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent, Andre Brigham Young, was convicted of six rapes over three decades. App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a. Young was scheduled to be released from prison for his most recent conviction in October 1990. One day prior to his scheduled release, the State filed a petition to commit Young as a sexually violent predator. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 32a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the commitment hearing, Young's mental health experts testified that there is no mental disorder that makes a person likely to reoffend and that there is no way to predict accurately who will reoffend. The State called an expert &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*256&lt;/span&gt; who testified, based upon a review of Young's records, that Young suffered from a severe personality disorder not otherwise specified with primarily paranoid and antisocial features, and a severe paraphilia, which would be classified as either paraphilia sexual sadism or paraphilia not otherwise specified (rape). See generally American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 522-523, 530, 532, 634, 645-646, 673 (4th ed. 1994). In the state expert's opinion, severe paraphilia constituted a mental abnormality under the Act. The State's expert concluded that Young's condition, in combination with the personality disorder, the span of time during which Young committed his crimes, his recidivism, his persistent denial, and his lack of empathy or remorse, made it more likely than not that he would commit further sexually violent acts. The victims of Young's rapes also testified. The jury unanimously concluded that Young was a sexually violent predator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young and another individual appealed their commitments in state court, arguing that the Act violated the Double Jeopardy, &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto,&lt;/i&gt; Due Process, and Equal Protection Clauses of the Federal Constitution. In major respects, the Washington Supreme Court held that the Act is constitutional. &lt;i&gt;In re Young,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/wash/6Kop/matter-of-personal-restraint-of-young/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;122&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wash. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 857 P. 2d 989 (1993) (en banc). To the extent the court concluded that the Act violated due process and equal protection principles, those rulings are reflected in subsequent amendments to the Act. See Part I&#151;A, &lt;i&gt;supra.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington court reasoned that the claimants' double jeopardy and &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; claims hinged on whether the Act is civil or criminal in nature. Following this Court's precedents, the court examined the language of the Act, the legislative history, and the purpose and effect of the statutory scheme. The court found that the legislature clearly intended to create a civil scheme both in the statutory language and legislative history. The court then turned to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*257&lt;/span&gt; examine whether the actual impact of the Act is civil or criminal. The Act, the court concluded, is concerned with treating committed persons for a current mental abnormality, and protecting society from the sexually violent acts associated with that abnormality, rather than being concerned with criminal culpability. The court distinguished the goals of incapacitation and treatment from the goal of punishment. The court found that the Washington Act is designed to further legitimate goals of civil confinement and that the claimants had failed to provide proof to the contrary. 122 Wash. 2d, at 18-25, 857 P. 2d, at 996-1000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Act spawned several other challenges in state and federal court, two of which bear mention. Richard Turay, committed as a sexually violent predator, filed suit in Federal District Court against Center officials under Rev. Stat. &#167; 1979, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1983, alleging unconstitutional conditions of confinement and inadequate treatment at the Center. In 1994, a jury concluded that the Center had failed to provide constitutionally adequate mental health treatment. App. 64-68. The court ordered officials at the Center to bring the institution up to constitutional standards, appointing a Special Master to monitor progress at the Center. The Center currently operates under an injunction. &lt;i&gt;Turay&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Seling,&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/wawd/drUy/turay-v-seling/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;108&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1148&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (WD Wash. 2000). See also Brief for Petitioner 8-9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turay also appealed his commitment as a sexually violent predator in state court, claiming, among other things, that the conditions of confinement at the Center rendered the Washington Act punitive "as applied" to him in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Washington Supreme Court ruled that Turay's commitment was valid. &lt;i&gt;In re Turay,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;139&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wash. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;379&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 986 P. 2d 790 (1999) (en banc). The court explained that in &lt;i&gt;Young,&lt;/i&gt; it had concluded that the Act is civil. 139 Wash. 2d, at 415, 986 P. 2d, at 809. The court also noted that this Court had recently held Kansas' Sexually Violent Predator Act, nearly identical to Washington's Act, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*258&lt;/span&gt; to be civil on its face. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; The Washington Supreme Court rejected Turay's theory of double jeopardy, reasoning that the double jeopardy claim must be resolved by asking whether the Act itself is civil. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 416-417, 986 P. 2d, at 810 (citing &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 522 U. S. 93 (1997)). The court concluded that Turay's proper remedy for constitutional violations in conditions of confinement at the Center was his &#167; 1983 action for damages and injunctive relief. 139 Wash. 2d, at 420, 986 P. 2d, at 812.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;C&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings us to the action before this Court. In 1994, after unsuccessful challenges to his confinement in state court, Young filed ahabeas action under 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2254 against the superintendent of the Center. Young contended that the Act was unconstitutional and that his confinement was illegal. He sought immediate release. The District Court granted the writ, concluding that the Act violated substantive due process, that the Act was criminal rather than civil, and that it violated the double jeopardy and &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; guarantees of the Constitution. &lt;i&gt;Young&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Weston,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/wawd/8vj6/young-v-weston/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;898&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;744&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (WD Wash. 1995). The superintendent appealed. While the appeal was pending, this Court decided &lt;i&gt;Kansas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hendricks,&lt;/i&gt; 521 U. S. 346 (1997), which held that Kansas' Sexually Violent Predator Act, on its face, met substantive due process requirements, was nonpunitive, and thus did not violate the Double Jeopardy and &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt;  Clauses. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals remanded Young's case to the District Court for reconsideration in light of &lt;i&gt;Hendricks.&lt;/i&gt; 122 F. 3d 38 (1997).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On remand, the District Court denied Young's petition. Young appealed and the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded in part and affirmed in part. 192 F. 3d 870 (1999). The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling that Young's confinement did not violate the substantive due process requirement that the State prove mental illness &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*259&lt;/span&gt; and dangerousness to justify confinement. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 876. The Court of Appeals also left undisturbed the District Court's conclusion that the Act meets procedural due process and equal protection guarantees, and the District Court's rejection of Young's challenges to his commitment proceedings. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 876-877. Young did not seek a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit for its decision affirming the District Court in these respects, and accordingly, those issues are not before this Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court's determination that because the Washington Act is civil, Young's double jeopardy and &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; claims must fail. The "linchpin" of Young's claims, the court reasoned, was whether the Act was punitive "as applied" to Young. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 873. The court did not read this Court's decision in &lt;i&gt;Hendricks&lt;/i&gt; to preclude the possibility that the Act could be punitive as applied. The court reasoned that actual conditions of confinement could divest a facially valid statute of its civil label upon a showing by the clearest proof that the statutory scheme is punitive in effect. 192 F. 3d, at 874.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals reviewed Young's claims that conditions of confinement at the Center were punitive and did not comport with due process. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 875. Young alleged that for seven years, he had been subject to conditions more restrictive than those placed on true civil commitment detainees, and even state prisoners. The Center, located wholly within the perimeter of a larger Department of Corrections (DOC) facility, relied on the DOC for a host of essential services, including library services, medical care, food, and security. More recently, Young claimed, the role of the DOC had increased to include daily security "walk-throughs." Young contended that the conditions and restrictions at the Center were not reasonably related to a legitimate nonpunitive goal, as residents were abused, confined to their rooms, subjected to random searches of their rooms and units, and placed under excessive security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*260&lt;/span&gt; Young also contended that conditions at the Center were incompatible with the Act's treatment purpose. The Center had a policy of videotaping therapy sessions and withholding privileges for refusal to submit to treatment. The Center residents were housed in units that, according to the Special Master in the &lt;i&gt;Turay&lt;/i&gt; litigation, were clearly inappropriate for persons in a mental health treatment program. The Center still lacked certified sex offender treatment providers. Finally, there was no possibility of release. A courtappointed resident advocate and psychologist concluded in his final report that because the Center had not fundamentally changed over so many years, he had come to suspect that the Center was designed and managed to punish and confine individuals for life without any hope of release to a less restrictive setting. 192 F. 3d, at 875. See also Amended Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, Supplemental Brief on Remand, and Motion to Alter Judgment 4-5, 8-9, 11-12, 15, 20, 24-26, in No. C94-480C (WD Wash.), Record, Doc. Nos. 57, 155, and 167.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ninth Circuit concluded that "[b]y alleging that [the Washington Act] is punitive as applied, Young alleged facts which, if proved, would entitle him to relief." 192 F. 3d, at 875. The court remanded the case to the District Court for a hearing to determine whether the conditions at the Center rendered the Act punitive as applied to Young. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 876.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Court granted the petition for a writ of certiorari, 529 U. S. 1017 (2000), to resolve the conflict between the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Washington Supreme Court. Compare 192 F. 3d 870 (1999), with &lt;i&gt;In re Turay,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;139&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wash. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;379&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 986 P. 2d 790 (1999).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Washington Supreme Court held and the Ninth Circuit acknowledged, we proceed on the understanding that the Washington Act is civil in nature. The Washington Act is strikingly similar to a commitment scheme we reviewed &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*261&lt;/span&gt; four Terms ago in &lt;i&gt;Kansas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hendricks,&lt;/i&gt; 521 U. S. 346 (1997). In fact, Kansas patterned its Act after Washington's. See &lt;i&gt;In re Hendricks,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;259&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Kan.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;246&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 249, 912 P. 2d 129, 131 (1996). In &lt;i&gt;Hendricks,&lt;/i&gt; we explained that the question whether an Act is civil or punitive in nature is initially one of statutory construction. 521 U. S., at 361 (citing &lt;i&gt;Allen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Illinois,&lt;/i&gt; 478 U. S. 364, 368 (1986)). A court must ascertain whether the legislature intended the statute to establish civil proceedings. A court will reject the legislature's manifest intent only where a party challenging the Act provides the clearest proof that the statutory scheme is so punitive in either purpose or effect as to negate the State's intention. 521 U. S., at 361 (citing &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ward,&lt;/i&gt; 448 U. S. 242, 248-249 (1980)). We concluded that the confined individual in that case had failed to satisfy his burden with respect to the Kansas Act. We noted several factors: The Act did not implicate retribution or deterrence; prior criminal convictions were used as evidence in the commitment proceedings, but were not a prerequisite to confinement; the Act required no finding of scienter to commit a person; the Act was not intended to function as a deterrent; and although the procedural safeguards were similar to those in the criminal context, they did not alter the character of the scheme. 521 U. S., at 361-365.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also examined the conditions of confinement provided by the Act. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 363-364. The Court was aware that sexually violent predators in Kansas were to be held in a segregated unit within the prison system. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 368. We explained that the Act called for confinement in a secure facility because the persons confined were dangerous to the community. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 363. We noted, however, that conditions within the unit were essentially the same as conditions for other involuntarily committed persons in mental hospitals. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Moreover, confinement under the Act was not necessarily indefinite in duration. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 364. Finally, we observed that in addition to protecting the public, the Act also provided treatment for sexually violent predators. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*262&lt;/span&gt; at 365-368. We acknowledged that not all mental conditions were treatable. For those individuals with untreatable conditions, however, we explained that there was no federal constitutional bar to their civil confinement, because the State had an interest in protecting the public from dangerous individuals with treatable as well as untreatable conditions. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 366. Our conclusion that the Kansas Act was "nonpunitive thus remove[d] an essential prerequisite for both Hendricks' double jeopardy and &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; claims." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 369.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since deciding &lt;i&gt;Hendricks,&lt;/i&gt; this Court has reaffirmed the principle that determining the civil or punitive nature of an Act must begin with reference to its text and legislative history. &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; v.&lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 522 U. S. 93 (1997). In &lt;i&gt;Hudson,&lt;/i&gt; which involved a double jeopardy challenge to monetary penalties and occupational debarment, this Court expressly disapproved of evaluating the civil nature of an Act by reference to the effect that Act has on a single individual. Instead, courts must evaluate the question by reference to a variety of factors "`considered in relation to the statute on its face' "; the clearest proof is required to override legislative intent and conclude that an Act denominated civil is punitive in purpose or effect. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 100 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Kennedy&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Mendoza-Martinez,&lt;/i&gt; 372 U. S. 144, 169 (1963)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, we turn to the Court of Appeals' determination that respondent could raise an "as-applied" challenge to the Act on double jeopardy and &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt;  grounds and seek release from confinement. Respondent essentially claims that the conditions of his confinement at the Center are too restrictive, that the conditions are incompatible with treatment, and that the system is designed to result in indefinite confinement. Respondent's claims are in many respects like the claims presented to the Court in &lt;i&gt;Hendricks,&lt;/i&gt; where we concluded that the conditions of confinement were largely explained by the State's goal to incapacitate, not to punish. 521 U. S., at 362-368. Nevertheless, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*263&lt;/span&gt; we do not deny that some of respondent's allegations are serious. Nor do we express any view as to how his allegations would bear on a court determining in the first instance whether Washington's confinement scheme is civil. Here, we evaluate respondent's allegations as presented in a double jeopardy and &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; challenge under the assumption that the Act is civil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hold that respondent cannot obtain release through an "as-applied" challenge to the Washington Act on double jeopardy and &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; grounds. We agree with petitioner that an "as-applied" analysis would prove unworkable. Such an analysis would never conclusively resolve whether a particular scheme is punitive and would thereby prevent a final determination of the scheme's validity under the Double Jeopardy and &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clauses. Brief for Petitioner 30; Reply Brief for Petitioner 9. Unlike a fine, confinement is not a fixed event. As petitioner notes, it extends over time under conditions that are subject to change. The particular features of confinement may affect how a confinement scheme is evaluated to determine whether it is civil rather than punitive, but it remains no less true that the query must be answered definitively. The civil nature of a confinement scheme cannot be altered based merely on vagaries in the implementation of the authorizing statute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent contends that the Ninth Circuit's "as-applied" analysis comports with this Court's precedents. He points out that this Court has considered conditions of confinement in evaluating the validity of confinement schemes in the past. Brief for Respondent 11-16, 29 (citing &lt;i&gt;Hendricks, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 363; &lt;i&gt;Reno&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Flores,&lt;/i&gt; 507 U. S. 292, 301-302 (1993); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Salerno,&lt;/i&gt; 481 U. S. 739, 747-748 (1987); &lt;i&gt;Allen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Illinois, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 373-374; &lt;i&gt;Schall&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Martin,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 253, 269&#151; 273 (1984)). All of those cases, however, presented the question whether the Act at issue was punitive. Permitting respondent's as-applied challenge would invite an end run around the Washington Supreme Court's decision that the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*264&lt;/span&gt; Act is civil in circumstances where a direct attack on that decision is not before this Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment, takes issue with our view that the question before the Court concerns an as-applied challenge to a civil Act. He first contends that respondent's challenge is not a true "as-applied" challenge because respondent does not claim that the statute "`by its own terms' is unconstitutional as applied . . . but rather that the statute is not being applied according to its terms at all." &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 271. We respectfully disagree. The Act requires "adequate care and individualized treatment," Wash. Rev. Code &#167; 71.09.080(2) (Supp. 2000), but the Act is silent with respect to the confinement conditions required at the Center, and that is the source of many of respondent's complaints, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 259-260. Justice Thomas next contends that we incorrectly assume that the Act is civil, instead of viewing the Act as "`&lt;i&gt;otherwise .&lt;/i&gt; . . civil,' or civil `on its face.' " &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 270 (emphasis added by Thomas, J.). However the Washington Act is described, our analysis in this case turns on the prior finding by the Washington Supreme Court that the Act is civil, and this Court's decision in &lt;i&gt;Hendricks&lt;/i&gt; that a nearly identical Act was civil. Petitioner could not have claimed that the Washington Act is "otherwise" or "facially" civil without relying on those prior decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dissent, Justice Stevens argues that we "incorrectly assum[e]" that the Act is "necessarily civil," &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 275, but the case has reached this Court under that very assumption. The Court of Appeals recognized that the Act is civil, and treated respondent's claim as an individual, "as-applied" challenge to the Act. The Court of Appeals then remanded the case to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing to determine respondent's conditions of confinement. Contrary to the dissent's characterization of the case, the Court of Appeals did not purport to undermine the validity of the Washington Act as a civil confinement scheme. The court did not conclude that respondent's allegations, if substantiated, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*265&lt;/span&gt; would be sufficient to refute the Washington Supreme Court's conclusion that the Act is civil, and to require the release of all those confined under its authority. The Ninth Circuit addressed only respondent's individual case, and we do not decide claims that are not presented by the decision below. &lt;i&gt;Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Epstein,&lt;/i&gt; 516 U. S. 367, 379 (1996). We reject the Ninth Circuit's "asapplied" analysis for double jeopardy and &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; claims as fundamentally flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our decision today does not mean that respondent and others committed as sexually violent predators have no remedy for the alleged conditions and treatment regime at the Center. The text of the Washington Act states that those confined under its authority have the right to adequate care and individualized treatment. Wash. Rev. Code &#167; 71.09.080(2) (Supp. 2000); Brief for Petitioner 14. As petitioner acknowledges, if the Center fails to fulfill its statutory duty, those confined may have a state law cause of action. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 10-11, 52. It is for the Washington courts to determine whether the Center is operating in accordance with state law and provide a remedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State courts, in addition to federal courts, remain competent to adjudicate and remedy challenges to civil confinement schemes arising under the Federal Constitution. As noted above, the Washington Supreme Court has already held that the Washington Act is civil in nature, designed to incapacitate and to treat. &lt;i&gt;In re Young,&lt;/i&gt; 122 Wash. 2d, at 18-25, 857 P. 2d, at 996-1000. Accordingly, due process requires that the conditions and duration of confinement under the Act bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which persons are committed. &lt;i&gt;Foucha&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Louisiana,&lt;/i&gt; 504 U. S. 71, 79 (1992); &lt;i&gt;Youngberg&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Romeo,&lt;/i&gt; 457 U. S. 307, 324 (1982); &lt;i&gt;Jackson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Indiana,&lt;/i&gt; 406 U. S. 715, 738 (1972).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we note that a &#167; 1983 action against the Center is pending in the Western District of Washington. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*266&lt;/span&gt; at 257. The Center operates under an injunction that requires it to adopt and implement a plan for training and hiring competent sex offender therapists; to improve relations between residents and treatment providers; to implement a treatment program for residents containing elements required by prevailing professional standards; to develop individual treatment programs; and to provide a psychologist or psychiatrist expert in the diagnosis and treatment of sex offenders to supervise the staff. App. 67. A Special Master has assisted in bringing the Center into compliance with the injunction. In its most recent published opinion on the matter, the District Court noted some progress at the Center in meeting the requirements of the injunction. &lt;i&gt;Turay&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Seling,&lt;/i&gt; 108 F. Supp. 2d, at 1154-1155.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case gives us no occasion to consider how the civil nature of a confinement scheme relates to other constitutional challenges, such as due process, or to consider the extent to which a court may look to actual conditions of confinement and implementation of the statute to determine in the first instance whether a confinement scheme is civil in nature. Justice Scalia, concurring, contends that conditions of confinement are irrelevant to determining whether an Act is civil unless state courts have interpreted the Act as permitting those conditions. By contrast, Justice Stevens would consider conditions of confinement at any time in order to gain "full knowledge of the effects of the statute." &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 277.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether a confinement scheme is punitive has been the threshold question for some constitutional challenges. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kansas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hendricks,&lt;/i&gt; 521 U. S. 346 (1997) (double jeopardy and &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; ); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Salerno,&lt;/i&gt; 481 U. S. 739 (1987) (due process); &lt;i&gt;Allen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Illinois,&lt;/i&gt; 478 U. S. 364 (1986) (Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination). Whatever these cases may suggest about the relevance of conditions of confinement, they do not endorse the approach of the dissent, which would render the inquiry into the "effects &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*267&lt;/span&gt; of the statute," &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 277, completely open ended. In one case, the Court refused to consider alleged confinement conditions because the parties had entered into a consent decree to improve conditions. &lt;i&gt;Flores,&lt;/i&gt; 507 U. S., at 301. The Court presumed that conditions were in compliance with the requirements of the consent decree. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; In another case, the Court found that anecdotal case histories and a statistical study were insufficient to render a regulatory confinement scheme punitive. &lt;i&gt;Martin,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S., at 272. In such cases, we have decided whether a confinement scheme is punitive notwithstanding the inherent difficulty in ascertaining current conditions and predicting future events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have not squarely addressed the relevance of conditions of confinement to a first instance determination, and that question need not be resolved here. An Act, found to be civil, cannot be deemed punitive "as applied" to a single individual in violation of the Double Jeopardy and &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clauses and provide cause for release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Souter joins, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with the Court's holding that a statute, "found to be civil [in nature], cannot be deemed punitive" or criminal "as applied" for purposes of the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; and Double Jeopardy Clauses. &lt;i&gt;Ante&lt;/i&gt; this page. The Court accurately observes that this holding gives us "no occasion to consider. . . the extent to which a court may look to actual conditions of confinement and implementation of the statute to determine in the first instance whether a confinement scheme is civil in nature." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 266. I write separately to dissociate myself from any implication that this reserved point may be an open question. I do not regard it as such since, three &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*268&lt;/span&gt; years ago, we rejected a similar double jeopardy challenge (based upon the statute's implementation "as applied" to the petitioners), where the statute had &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; yet been determined to be civil in nature, and where we &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; making that determination "in the first instance." See &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 522 U. S. 93 (1997). To be consistent with the most narrow holding of that case (which, unlike this one, did not involve imposition of confinement), any consideration of subsequent implementation in the course of making a "first instance" determination cannot extend to &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; subsequent implementation, but must be limited to implementation of confinement, and of other impositions that are "not a fixed event," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 263. That, however, would be a peculiar limitation, since even "fixed events" such as the imposition of a fine can, in their implementation, acquire penal aspects&#151; exemplified in &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; by the allegedly punitive size of the fines, and by the availability of reduction for "good-faith" violations, see 522 U. S., at 97-98, 104. Moreover, the language and the reasoning of &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; leave no room for such a peculiar limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that case, the petitioners contended that the punitive nature of the statute that had been applied to them could be assessed by considering the aforementioned features of the fines. We flatly rejected that contention, which found support in our prior decision in &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Halper,&lt;/i&gt; 490 U. S. 435 (1989). &lt;i&gt;Halper,&lt;/i&gt; we said, had erroneously made a "significant departure" from our prior jurisprudence, in deciding "to `asses[s] the character of the actual sanctions imposed,' 490 U. S., at 447, rather than, as &lt;i&gt;Kennedy&lt;/i&gt; [v. &lt;i&gt;Mendoza-Martinez,&lt;/i&gt; 372 U. S. 144 (1963),] demanded, evaluating the `statute on its face' to determine whether it provided for what amounted to a criminal sanction, &lt;i&gt;[id.],&lt;/i&gt; at 169." 522 U. S., at 101. The &lt;i&gt;Kennedy&lt;/i&gt; factors, we said, "`must be considered in relation to the statute on its face,' " 522 U. S., at 100, quoting from &lt;i&gt;Kennedy&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mendoza-Martinez,&lt;/i&gt; 372 U. S. 144, 169 (1963). We held that "[t]he fact that petitioners' &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*269&lt;/span&gt; `good faith' was considered in determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed in this case [a circumstance that would normally indicate the assessment is punitive] is irrelevant, as we look only to `the statute on its face' to determine whether a penalty is criminal in nature." &lt;i&gt;Hudson, supra,&lt;/i&gt;  at 104, quoting &lt;i&gt;Kennedy, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 169. We repeated, to be sure, the principle that the statutory scheme would be criminal if it was sufficiently punitive "`either in purpose &lt;i&gt;or effect,&lt;/i&gt; ` " &lt;i&gt;Hudson, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 99 (emphasis added), quoting &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ward,&lt;/i&gt; 448 U. S. 242, 248-249 (1980), but it was clear from the opinion that this referred to effects apparent upon the face of the statute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short of the matter is that, for Double Jeopardy and &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause purposes, the question of criminal penalty &lt;i&gt;vel non&lt;/i&gt; depends upon the intent of the legislature;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; and harsh executive implementation cannot "transfor[m] what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty," &lt;i&gt;Rex Trailer Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 350 U. S. 148, 154 (1956), any more than compassionate executive implementation can transform a criminal penalty into a civil remedy. This is not to say that there is no relief from a system that administers a facially civil statute in a fashion that would render it criminal. The remedy, however, is not to invalidate the legislature's handiwork under the Double Jeopardy Clause, but to eliminate whatever excess in administration contradicts the statute's civil character. When, as here, a state statute is at issue, the remedy for implementation that does not comport with the civil nature of the statute is resort to the traditional state proceedings that challenge unlawful executive action; if those proceedings fail, and the state &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*270&lt;/span&gt; courts authoritatively interpret the state statute as permitting impositions that are indeed punitive, then and only then can federal courts pronounce a statute that on its face is civil to be criminal. Such an approach protects federal courts from becoming enmeshed in the sort of intrusive inquiry into local conditions at state institutions that are best left to the State's own judiciary, at least in the first instance. And it avoids federal invalidation of state statutes on the basis of executive implementation that the state courts themselves, given the opportunity, would find to be ultra vires. Only this approach, it seems to me, is in accord with our sound and traditional reluctance to be the initial interpreter of state law. See &lt;i&gt;Railroad Comm'n of Tex.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pullman Co.,&lt;/i&gt;  312 U. S. 496, 500-501 (1941).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;With this clarification, I join the opinion of the Court. Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We granted certiorari to decide whether "an &lt;i&gt;otherwise&lt;/i&gt;  valid civil statute can be divested of its civil nature" simply because of an administrative agency's failure to implement the statute according to its terms. Pet. for Cert. i (emphasis added). The majority declines to answer this question. Instead, it assumes that the statute at issue &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; civil&#151;rather than "&lt;i&gt;otherwise&lt;/i&gt; . . . civil," or civil "on its face." &lt;i&gt;Young&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Weston,&lt;/i&gt; 122 F. 3d 38 (CA9 1997). And then it merely holds that a statute that is civil cannot be deemed the opposite of civil&#151;"punitive," as the majority puts it&#151;as applied to a single individual. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 267. In explaining this conclusion, the majority expressly reserves judgment on whether the manner of implementation should affect a court's assessment of a statute as civil in the "first instance." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 263, 267. I write separately to express my view, first, that a statute which is civil on its face cannot be divested of its civil nature simply because of the manner in which it is implemented, and second, that the distinction between a challenge in the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*271&lt;/span&gt; "first instance" and a subsequent challenge is one without a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before proceeding, it is important to clarify the issue in this case. The majority adopts the Ninth Circuit's nomenclature and refers to respondent's claim as an "as-applied" challenge, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 263, but that label is at best misleading. Typically an "as-applied" challenge is a claim that a statute, "&lt;i&gt;by its own terms,&lt;/i&gt; infringe[s] constitutional freedoms in the circumstances of [a] particular case." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Christian Echoes Nat. Ministry, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 404 U. S. 561, 565 (1972) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; (emphasis added). In contrast, respondent's claim is not that Washington's Community Protection Act of 1990 (Washington Act or Act), Wash. Rev. Code &#167; 71.09.010 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; (1992), "by its own terms" is unconstitutional as applied to him,&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; but rather that the statute is not being applied according to its terms at all.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Respondent essentially contends that the actual conditions of confinement, notwithstanding the text of the statute, are punitive and incompatible with the Act's treatment purpose. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 259-260.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*272&lt;/span&gt; A challenge, such as this one, to the implementation of a facially civil statute is not only "unworkable," as the majority puts it, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 263, but also prohibited by our decision in &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 522 U. S. 93 (1997). In &lt;i&gt;Hudson,&lt;/i&gt;  we held that, when determining whether a statute is civil or criminal, a court must examine the "statute on its face." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 101, quoting &lt;i&gt;Kennedy&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mendoza-Martinez,&lt;/i&gt; 372 U. S. 144, 169 (1963) (internal quotation marks omitted). In so holding, we expressly disavowed the approach used in &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Halper,&lt;/i&gt; 490 U. S. 435, 448 (1989), which evaluated the "actual sanctions imposed." 522 U. S., at 101, quoting &lt;i&gt;Halper, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 447 (internal quotation marks omitted). Respondent's claim is flatly inconsistent with the holding of &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; because respondent asks us to look beyond the face of the Washington Act and to examine instead the actual sanctions imposed on him, that is, the actual conditions of confinement. Respondent argues, and the Ninth Circuit held, that &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; `s reach is limited to the particular sanctions involved in that case&#151;monetary penalties and occupational disbarment&#151;and does not apply here, where the sanction is confinement. &lt;i&gt;Hudson,&lt;/i&gt; however, contains no indication whatsoever that its holding is limited to the specific sanctions at issue. To the contrary, as we explained in &lt;i&gt;Hudson,&lt;/i&gt; a court may not elevate to dispositive status any of the factors that it may consider in determining whether a sanction is criminal.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; 522 U. S., at 101. One of these nondispositive &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*273&lt;/span&gt; factors is confinement. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 99 (stating that one of the factors is "[w]hether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint," quoting &lt;i&gt;Mendoza-Martinez, supra,&lt;/i&gt;  at 168 (internal quotation marks omitted)). Yet elevating confinement to dispositive status is exactly what respondent asks us to do when he advances his distinction between confinement and other sanctions. Because &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; rejects such an argument, respondent's claim fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An implementation-based challenge to a facially civil statute would be as inappropriate in reviewing the statute in the "first instance," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 263, 267 (majority opinion), as it is here. In the first instance, as here, there is no place for such a challenge in the governing jurisprudence. &lt;i&gt;Hudson,&lt;/i&gt; which requires courts to look at the face of the statute, precludes implementation-based challenges at any time. Moreover, the implementation-based claim would be as "unworkable," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 263 (majority opinion), in the first instance as in later challenges. Because the actual conditions of confinement may change over time and may vary from facility to facility, an implementation-based challenge, if successful, would serve to invalidate a statute that may be implemented without any constitutional infirmities at a future time or in a separate facility. To use the majority's words, the validity of a statute should not be "based merely on vagaries in the implementation of the authorizing statute." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet the majority suggests that courts may be able to consider conditions of confinement in determining whether a statute is punitive. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 263, 266. To the extent that the conditions are actually provided for on the face of the statute, I of course agree. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Hudson, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 101 (directing courts to look at "`the statute on its face' "). However, to the extent that the conditions result from the fact that the statute is not being applied according to its terms, the conditions are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the effect of the statute, but rather the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*274&lt;/span&gt; effect of its improper implementation.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; A suit based on these conditions cannot prevail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington Act does not provide on its face for punitive conditions of confinement, and the actual conditions under which the Act is implemented are of no concern to our inquiry. I therefore concur in the judgment of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sexual predator may be imprisoned for violating the law, and, if he is mentally ill, he may be committed to an institution until he is cured. Whether a specific statute authorizing the detention of such a person is properly viewed as "criminal" or "civil" in the context of federal constitutional issues is often a question of considerable difficulty. See &lt;i&gt;Kansas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hendricks,&lt;/i&gt; 521 U. S. 346 (1997) (reversing, by a 5-to-4 vote, a decision of the Kansas Supreme Court invalidating &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*275&lt;/span&gt; Kansas' Sexually Violent Predator Act); &lt;i&gt;Allen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Illinois,&lt;/i&gt; 478 U. S. 364 (1986) (upholding, by a 5-to-4 vote, Illinois' Sexually Dangerous Persons Act); &lt;i&gt;In re Young,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/wash/6Kop/matter-of-personal-restraint-of-young/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;122&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wash. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 857 P. 2d 989 (1993) (en banc) (upholding, by a 5-to-4 vote, the provisions of Washington's Community Protection Act of 1990 dealing with sexually violent predators).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is settled, however, that the question whether a state statute is civil or criminal in nature for purposes of complying with the demands of the Federal Constitution is a question of federal law. If a detainee comes forward with "`the clearest proof' that `the statutory scheme [is] so punitive either in purpose &lt;i&gt;or effect&lt;/i&gt; as to negate [the State's] intention' that the proceeding be civil, it must be considered criminal." &lt;i&gt;Allen,&lt;/i&gt; 478 U. S., at 369 (quoting &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ward,&lt;/i&gt; 448 U. S. 242, 248-249 (1980)) (emphasis added). See also &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 522 U. S. 93, 100, 105 (1997). Accordingly, we have consistently looked to the conditions of confinement as evidence of both the legislative purpose behind the statute and its actual effect. See &lt;i&gt;Hendricks,&lt;/i&gt; 521 U. S., at 361, 367-369; &lt;i&gt;Schall&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Martin,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 253, 269&#151; 271 (1984); &lt;i&gt;Allen,&lt;/i&gt; 478 U. S., at 369, 373-374. As we have acknowledged in those cases, the question whether a statute is in fact punitive cannot always be answered solely by reference to the text of the statute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority in this case, however, incorrectly assumes that the Act at issue is necessarily civil. The issue the majority purports to resolve is whether an Act that is otherwise civil in nature can be deemed criminal in a specific instance based on evidence of its application to a particular prisoner. However, respondent Young's petition did not present that issue. Rather, consistent with our case law, Young sought to introduce evidence of the conditions of confinement as evidence of the punitive purpose and effect of the Washington statute. See Amended Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus 6 and Supp. Brief on Remand 2, 6, 10-11, in No. C94-480C (WD Wash.), Record, Doc. Nos. 57, 155. As a result, Young in no &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*276&lt;/span&gt; way runs afoul of &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 522 U. S. 93 (1997). Properly read, &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; acknowledges that resolving whether an Act is civil or criminal in nature can take into account whether the statutory scheme has a punitive effect.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 99. What &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; rejects is an approach &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; taken by respondent&#151;one that bypasses this threshold question in favor of a dispositive focus on the sanction actually imposed on the specific individual.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 101-102.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the question whether an Act is civil or punitive in nature "is initially one of statutory construction." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt;  at 261 (majority opinion). However, under the majority's analysis, there is no inquiry beyond that of statutory construction. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 263. In essence, the majority argues that because the constitutional query must be answered definitively and because confinement is not a "fixed event," conditions of confinement should not be considered at all, except in the first challenge to a statute, when, as a practical matter, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*277&lt;/span&gt; the evidence of such conditions is most likely &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to constitute the requisite "clearest proof." This seems to me quite wrong. If conditions of confinement are such that a detainee has been punished twice in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause, it is irrelevant that the scheme has been previously labeled as civil without full knowledge of the effects of the statute.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, Young has made detailed allegations concerning both the absence of treatment for his alleged mental illness and the starkly punitive character of the conditions of his confinement. If proved, those allegations establish not just that those detained pursuant to the statute are treated like those imprisoned for violations of Washington's criminal laws, but that, in many respects, they receive significantly worse treatment.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; If those allegations are correct, the statute in question should be characterized as a criminal law for federal constitutional purposes. I therefore agree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that respondent should be given the opportunity to come forward with the "clearest proof" that his allegations are true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Briefs of &lt;i&gt;amici curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging affirmance were filed for the California Atascadero State Hospital Section 6600 Civil Committees by &lt;i&gt;Joel E. Krischer;&lt;/i&gt; and for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers by &lt;i&gt;Edward M. Chikofsky&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Barbara E. Bergman.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 522 U. S. 93 (1997), addressed only the Double Jeopardy Clause. Since, however, the very wording of the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt;  Clause&#151;"No State shall . . . &lt;i&gt;pass&lt;/i&gt; any . . . ex post facto &lt;i&gt;Law,&lt;/i&gt; " U. S. Const., Art. I, &#167; 10, cl. 1 (emphases added)&#151;leaves no doubt that it is a prohibition upon &lt;i&gt;legislative&lt;/i&gt; action, the irrelevance of subsequent executive implementation to that constitutional question is, if anything, even clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Respondent has made the claim that the terms of the Washington Act are criminal so that his confinement under the Act thus violates the Double Jeopardy and &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clauses, but this claim was rejected below&#151;first by the Washington Supreme Court, &lt;i&gt;In re Young,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/wash/6Kop/matter-of-personal-restraint-of-young/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;122&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wash. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 18-23, 857 P. 2d 989, 996-999 (1993), and then by the Ninth Circuit, &lt;i&gt;Young&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Weston,&lt;/i&gt; 192 F. 3d 870, 874 (1999)&#151;and has not been presented to this Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Disagreeing with this characterization, the majority contends that the statute is silent with respect to conditions of confinement. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 264. Even if the majority were correct&#151;which it is not, see Wash. Rev. Code &#167; 71.09.070 (requiring annual examinations of each person's mental conditions); &#167; 71.09.080(2) (Supp. 2000) (requiring "adequate care and individualized treatment"); see also &lt;i&gt;In re Young, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 18-23, 857 P. 2d, at 996-999 (discussing similar provisions on conditions of confinement in 1990 version of Washington Act)&#151;the question on which we granted certiorari expressly assumes that the statute "mandate[s]" the "conditions of confinement" that petitioner seeks. See Pet. for Cert. i.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  The &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; Court referred to the seven factors listed in &lt;i&gt;Kennedy&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Mendoza-Martinez,&lt;/i&gt; 372 U. S. 144 (1963), as "useful guideposts": "(1) whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint; (2) whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment; (3) whether it comes into play only on a finding of &lt;i&gt;scienter;&lt;/i&gt; (4) whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment&#151;retribution and deterrence; (5) whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime; (6) whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it; and (7) whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned." 522 U. S., at 99-100, quoting &lt;i&gt;Mendoza-Martinez, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 168-169 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  The dissent argues that, "under the majority's analysis, there is no inquiry beyond that of statutory construction," &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 276 (opinion of Stevens, J.). Although it is unclear to me whether the dissent is correct on this score, I hope that state and federal courts so interpret the majority opinion. For even if the majority opinion does not preclude venturing beyond the face of the statute, &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; certainly does. See &lt;i&gt;Hudson,&lt;/i&gt; 522 U. S., at 101 (holding that courts must examine a statute "`on its face' " and may not consider the "`actual sanctions imposed' "); &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 272.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To dispel any suggestion to the contrary, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 261-262, 263, 266 (majority opinion); &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 275 (Stevens, J., dissenting), I note that &lt;i&gt;Kansas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hendricks,&lt;/i&gt; 521 U. S. 346 (1997), does not provide support for implementation-based challenges. In &lt;i&gt;Hendricks,&lt;/i&gt; "none of the parties argue[d] that people institutionalized under the . . . civil commitment statute are subject to punitive conditions." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 363. The viability of an implementation-based challenge was simply not at issue. And significantly, six months after &lt;i&gt;Hendricks,&lt;/i&gt; we held in &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; that inquiries into whether a statute is civil are restricted to the "face" of the statute. &lt;i&gt;Hudson, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 101. To the extent that &lt;i&gt;Hendricks&lt;/i&gt; (or any previous opinion, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 266 (majority opinion)) left a door open by not answering the implementation question, &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; closed that door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  In his concurrence, Justice Scalia concludes that, under the rule of &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 522 U. S. 93 (1997),courts may &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; look to actual conditions of confinement and implementation of the statute to determine in the first instance whether a confinement scheme is civil in nature. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 267-268. Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment, would take &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; even further, precluding implementation-based challenges "at any time." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 273. However, for the reasons set out above, I believe that both concurrences misread &lt;i&gt;Hudson.&lt;/i&gt; I also note that &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; did not involve confinement. In cases that do involve confinement, this Court has relied on the principle that a statutory scheme must be deemed criminal if it was sufficiently punitive "`either in purpose or effect.' " See &lt;i&gt;Kansas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hendricks,&lt;/i&gt; 521 U. S. 346, 361, 367-369 (1997); &lt;i&gt;Schall&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Martin,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 253, 269-271 (1984); &lt;i&gt;Allen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Illinois,&lt;/i&gt; 478 U. S. 364, 369, 373-374 (1986).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  In response to my dissent, the Court has made it clear that it is simply holding that respondent may not prevail if he merely proves that the statute is punitive insofar as it has been applied to him. The question whether he may prevail if he can prove that the statute is punitive in its application to everyone confined under its provisions therefore remains open. In sum, the Court has rejected the narrow holding of the Ninth Circuit, but has not addressed the sufficiency of the broadest claim that petitioner has advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  In this case, those detained pursuant to Washington's statute have sought an improvement in conditions for almost seven years. Their success in the courts, however, has had little practical impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Under such conditions, Young has now served longer in prison following the completion of his sentence than he did on the sentence itself.&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*427&lt;/span&gt; Stevens, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Timothy Jones&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Thomas C. Goldstein, W. Allen Bennett,&lt;/i&gt;  and &lt;i&gt;Erik S. Jaffe.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;David C. Frederick&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Ogden, Deputy Solicitor General Underwood,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Irene M. Solet.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incident to the authorization of a massive flood control project for the Mississippi River in 1928, Congress enacted an immunity provision which stated that "[n]o liability of any kind shall attach to or rest upon the United States for any damage from or by floods or flood waters at any place." 45 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*427&lt;/span&gt; Stat. 535, as amended, 33 U. S. C. &#167; 702c. At issue in this case is the meaning of the words "floods or flood waters." The narrow question presented is whether those words encompass all the water that flows through a federal facility that was designed and is operated, at least in part, for flood control purposes. The Ninth Circuit, relying upon a broader construction of &#167; 702c than some other federal courts have adopted, concluded that they do. We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 529 U. S. 1017 (2000), and now reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner owns 1,000 acres of pistachio orchards in California's San Joaquin Valley. The Madera Canal, a federal facility that has been leased to the Madera Irrigation District (MID), flows through petitioner's property. In 1996, petitioner brought this action against respondent United States and the MID alleging that their negligence in the design, construction, and maintenance of the canal had caused subsurface flooding resulting in damage to the orchards and increased operating costs for petitioner. Petitioner did not allege that any physical failure of the dam caused the damage to its property. The complaint sought damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2671 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; as well as injunctive relief. Relying on the immunity granted by the Flood Control Act of 1928, 33 U. S. C. &#167; 702c, the United States moved for judgment on the pleadings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting petitioner's submission that the Madera Canal was used for irrigation purposes, the District Court nevertheless dismissed the complaint because the parties agreed that the canal was a part of the Friant Division of the Central Valley Project, and that flood control was one of the purposes of that project. The District Court's decision was dictated by an earlier Ninth Circuit case, which held that if a "`project has flood control as one of its purposes, and the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*428&lt;/span&gt; events giving rise to the action were not wholly unrelated to the project,' " immunity necessarily attached.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed. It agreed with petitioner that the Madera Canal "serves no flood control purpose," but nevertheless held that immunity attached "solely because it is a branch of the Central Valley Project." 177 F. 3d 834, 839 (1999). As the Ninth Circuit put it, "[a]lthough the water in the Madera Canal was not held for the purpose of flood control, because it was part of the Central Valley Project, it was &lt;i&gt;'not wholly unrelated'&lt;/i&gt; to flood control." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; (emphasis added). In so holding, however, the court recognized that the Government would probably not have enjoyed immunity in at least three other Circuits where the courts require a nexus between flood control activities and the harm done to the plaintiff.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Noting the "harsh result of [the] decision," the Ninth Circuit frankly acknowledged that "[t]he `not wholly unrelated' test applied by this and other circuits reads broadly an already broadly written grant of immunity." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; As the Ninth Circuit recognized, under such a test, there would seem to be no "set of facts where the government is not immune from damage arising from water that at one time passed through part of the Central Valley or other flood control project." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not until more than a half century after its enactment did this Court have occasion to interpret &#167; 702c. In a consolidated case arising out of two separate accidents, we held that the section "bars recovery where the Federal Government &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*429&lt;/span&gt; would otherwise be liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2671 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; for personal injury caused by the Federal Government's negligent failure to warn of the dangers from the release of floodwaters from federal flood control projects." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;James,&lt;/i&gt; 478 U. S. 597, 599 (1986).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principal issue in the &lt;i&gt;James&lt;/i&gt; case was whether the statutory word "damage" encompassed not just property damage, but also personal injuries and death. In light of the legislative history, which it reviewed at some length, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 606-609, 610-612, the Court concluded that the best reading of the statutory text was one which was both broader and less literal, and which encompassed the claims at issue in the two cases before the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both instances, the injuries were caused by the turbulent current generated by unwarned releases of waters from a reservoir after the Army Corps of Engineers had determined that the waters were at "flood stage." The fact that the injuries were caused by "flood waters" was undisputed.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; In its opinion, the Court held that the language of the statute covered the two accidents because the "injuries occurred as a result of the release of waters from reservoirs that had reached flood stage." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 604.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the Court's opinion in &lt;i&gt;James&lt;/i&gt; included a passage that lends support to the Ninth Circuit's holding in this case. In that passage, the Court wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*430&lt;/span&gt; "Nor do the terms `flood' and `flood waters' create any uncertainty in the context of accidents such as the ones at issue in these cases. The Act concerns flood control projects designed to carry floodwaters. &lt;i&gt;It is thus clear&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;from &#167; 702c's plain language that the terms `flood' and&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;'flood waters' apply to all waters contained in or car-&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;ried through a federal flood control project for purposes&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;of or related to flood control,&lt;/i&gt; as well as to waters that such projects cannot control." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 605 (emphasis added).&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sentence that we have italicized and, in particular, the phrase "related to flood control" have generated conflicting opinions among the Courts of Appeals. In an attempt to make sense of what is admittedly confusing dicta, some courts have focused on whether the damage relates in some, often tenuous, way to a flood control project, rather than whether it relates to "floods or flood waters."&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; However, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*431&lt;/span&gt; more than one court has pointed out that, if read literally, the sentence sweeps so broadly as to make little sense.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; Moreover, the sentence was unquestionably dictum because it was not essential to our disposition of any of the issues contested in &lt;i&gt;James.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; It is therefore appropriate to resort to the text of the statute, as illuminated by our holding in &lt;i&gt;James,&lt;/i&gt; rather than to that isolated comment, to determine whether the water flowing through the Madera Canal that allegedly caused the damage to petitioner's pistachio orchards is covered by &#167; 702c. See &lt;i&gt;Humphrey's Executor&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 295 U. S. 602, 627 (1935) (dicta "may be followed if sufficiently persuasive" but are not binding). See also &lt;i&gt;U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bonner Mall Partnership,&lt;/i&gt; 513 U. S. 18, 24 (1994).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;James,&lt;/i&gt; we held that the phrase "floods or flood waters" is not narrowly confined to those waters that a federal project is unable to control, and that it encompasses waters that are released for flood control purposes when reservoired waters are at flood stage. That holding, however, is vastly different from the Ninth Circuit's reading of &#167; 702c, under which immunity attaches simply because the Madera Canal is part of the Friant Division of the Central Valley Project, and flood control is one of the purposes served by that project. The &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*432&lt;/span&gt; holding in &lt;i&gt;James&lt;/i&gt; also differs from the less attenuated and more fact-specific position advanced by the Government, which would require us to take judicial notice of evidence that the Friant Division of the Central Valley Project and, indeed, the Madera Canal itself can and do serve flood control purposes. We ultimately conclude that the judgment cannot be upheld under either rationale, but begin with a description of the Central Valley Project and an explanation of the factual basis for the Government's submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin by observing that water can be either a liability or an asset. The Mississippi River flood of 1927 was unquestionably an example of the former. That flood in turn led to the enactment of the 1928 Flood Control Act. Similar, though less extreme, floods of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers in California provided an important motivation for the authorization of the Central Valley Project. Although that project has not completely eliminated flooding on either river, it has succeeded in converting a huge liability into an immensely valuable asset. Justice Jackson described the magnitude of that transformation in his opinion for the Court in &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gerlach Live Stock Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 339 U. S. 725 (1950):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This is a gigantic undertaking to redistribute the principal fresh-water resources of California. Central Valley is a vast basin, stretching over 400 miles on its polar axis and a hundred in width, in the heart of California. Bounded by the Sierra Nevada on the east and by coastal ranges on the west, it consists actually of two separate river valleys which merge in a single pass to the sea at the Golden Gate. Its rich acres, counted in the millions, are deficient in rainfall and must remain generally arid and unfruitful unless artificially watered.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*433&lt;/span&gt; "To . . . make water available where it would be of greatest service, the State of California proposed to reengineer its natural water distribution. This project was taken over by the United States in 1935 and has since been a federal enterprise. The plan, in broad outline, is to capture and store waters of both rivers and many of their tributaries in their highland basins, in some cases taking advantage of the resulting head for generation of electric energy. . . . [T]he waters of the San Joaquin will be arrested at Friant, where they would take leave of the mountains, and will be diverted north and south through a system of canals and sold to irrigate more than a million acres of land, some as far as 160 miles away. A cost of refreshing this great expanse of semiarid land is that, except for occasional spills, only a dry river bed will cross the plain below the dam. Here, however, surplus waters from the north are utilized, for through a 150-mile canal Sacramento water is to be pumped to the cultivated lands formerly dependent on the San Joaquin." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 728-729.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Central Valley basin development envisions, in one sense, an integrated undertaking, but also an aggregate of many subsidiary projects, each of which is of first magnitude. It consists of thirty-eight major dams and reservoirs bordering the valley floor and scores of smaller ones in headwaters. It contemplates twentyeight hydropower generating stations. It includes hundreds of miles of main canals, thousands of miles of laterals and drains, electric transmission and feeder lines and substations, and a vast network of structures for the control and use of water on two million acres of land already irrigated, three million acres of land to be newly irrigated, 360,000 acres in the delta needing protection from intrusions of salt water, and for municipal and miscellaneous purposes including cities, towns, duck clubs and game refuges. These projects are not only widely &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*434&lt;/span&gt; separated geographically, many of them physically independent in operation, but they are authorized in separate acts from year to year and are to be constructed at different times over a considerable span of years." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 733.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Jackson's description of the magnitude of the Central Valley Project makes one proposition perfectly clear: to characterize every drop of water that flows through that immense project as "flood water" simply because flood control is among the purposes served by the project unnecessarily dilutes the language of the statute. The text of the statute does not include the words "flood control project." Rather, it states that immunity attaches to "any damage from or by floods or flood waters . . . ." Accordingly, the text of the statute directs us to determine the scope of the immunity conferred, not by the character of the federal project or the purposes it serves, but by the character of the waters that cause the relevant damage and the purposes behind their release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government has asked us to take judicial notice of certain basic facts about the Friant Division of the Central Valley Project and about the waters flowing through that division and, more particularly, through the Madera Canal. Although petitioner will have an opportunity to challenge those details on remand, we accept them for purposes of this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two major rivers supplying water to the Central Valley Project are the Sacramento in the north, and the San Joaquin in the south. From its headwaters in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, the San Joaquin flows in a southwesterly direction into a reservoir, known as Millerton Lake, just above the Friant Dam. The reservoir has a storage capacity of 520,500 acre-feet of water. In dry years, the total flow in the river does not produce that amount, but on average, the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*435&lt;/span&gt; annual flow apparently approximates 3&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;20442 times the reservoir's capacity. Water is released through outlets in the dam that send it down the San Joaquin River, and also through outlets that direct it into either the Madera Canal to the northwest, or the Friant-Kern Canal to the southeast. When the water level exceeds 578 feet, it flows over the dam's spillway into the San Joaquin. At that point, the river can accommodate a flow of 8,000 cubic feet per second without flooding. The Madera Canal can accommodate 1,200 cubic feet per second, and the Friant-Kern another 4,500 cubic feet per second. Thus, a total release of 13,700 cubic feet per second in three directions would not appear to include any "flood water."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Madera Canal, which is about 40 miles in length, is used primarily for irrigation purposes. Water that enters the canal at the Friant Dam is purchased by farmers who either use it immediately or store it for future use. As a result, the amount of water that enters the canal is larger than the quantity that may flow into the Chowchilla River at its terminus.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; Except in years of extreme drought, the Madera Irrigation District provides contracting farmers with "a dependable water supply" of approximately 138,000 acre-feet of "Class 1 water." In addition, "if, as, and when it can be made available," the District sells "Class 2 water" to the farmers at a price that is lower than the Class 1 price because of the "uncertainty as to availability and time of occurrence." &lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; Thus, again in a literal sense, it seems clear that none of the Class 1 or Class 2 water sold by the District and purchased by the farmers to store or irrigate their lands includes any "flood water."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*436&lt;/span&gt; Water that is not purchased under either class simply flows through the canal into the Chowchilla River. As the Government points out, that excess may include flood water. However, given the fact that the canal can accommodate a flow of 1,200 cubic feet per second, which amounts to about 2,380 acre-feet per day, it is entirely possible that over the span of a year, several times the amount of Class 1 and Class 2 waters described in the papers submitted by the Government could flow through the canal without causing anything approaching a flood. Nevertheless, according to the Government, because the Madera Canal is available to divert water that might otherwise produce a flood on the San Joaquin and flood control is among the purposes served by the canal, &#167; 702c immunity must attach to all the water that flows through the canal. Under the Government's approach, this would be true even if the water never approached flood stage and the terminus of the canal was parched at the end of the summer. Admittedly, it is possible to read the "related to" portion of the dictum from &lt;i&gt;James&lt;/i&gt; to support that result, but neither the language of the statute itself, nor the holding in &lt;i&gt;James,&lt;/i&gt; even arguably supports such a strange conclusion. Accordingly, we disavow that portion of &lt;i&gt;James&lt;/i&gt; ` dicta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;V&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case does raise a difficult issue because the property damage at issue was allegedly caused by continuous or repeated flows occurring over a period of years, rather than by a single, discrete incident. It is relatively easy to determine that a particular release of water that has reached flood stage is "flood water," as in &lt;i&gt;James,&lt;/i&gt; or that a release directed by a power company for the commercial purpose of generating electricity is not, as in &lt;i&gt;Henderson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 965 F. 2d 1488 (CA8 1992). It is, however, not such a simple matter when damage may have been caused over a period of time in part by flood waters and in part by the routine use of the canal when it contained little more than a trickle. The &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*437&lt;/span&gt; fact that a serious flood did occur in the San Joaquin in 1997 creates the distinct possibility that flood waters may have surged down the Madera Canal and harmed petitioner's property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For present purposes, we merely hold that it was error to grant the Government's motion for judgment on the pleadings and that it is the text of &#167; 702c, as informed by our holding in &lt;i&gt;James,&lt;/i&gt; rather than the broad dictum in that opinion, that governs the scope of the United States' immunity from liability for damage caused "by floods or flood waters." Accordingly, in determining whether &#167; 702c immunity attaches, courts should consider the character of the waters that cause the relevant damage rather than the relation between that damage and a flood control project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

This release created a swift, strong current toward the underwater discharge." 478 U. S., at 599. The second case arose as a result of a decision by the Corps of Engineers to release waters in the reservoir of Bayou Courtableau Basin which "were at flood stage." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 601. The District Court found that &#167; 702c applied because the "`gates were opened to &lt;i&gt;prevent&lt;/i&gt; flooding and inundation landside of the drainage structure.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 602 (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  The Court appended a footnote pointing out that the District Court in each case had found that the waters at issue had been "released from federal flood control facilities to prevent flooding" and that the Court of Appeals had upheld those findings "and assumed that `the waters in this [consolidated] case were floodwaters.' " See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 606, n. 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Washington&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;East Columbia Basin Irrigation Dist.,&lt;/i&gt; 105 F. 3d 517 (CA9 1997); &lt;i&gt;Williams&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 957 F. 2d 742 (CA10 1992); &lt;i&gt;Dawson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 894 F. 2d 70 (CA3 1990); &lt;i&gt;DeWitt Bank &amp;amp; Trust Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 878 F. 2d 246 (CA8 1989). This approach, however, can be overinclusive. As Judge Easterbrook has pointed out: "The `management of a flood control project' includes building roads to reach the beaches and hiring staff to run the project. If the Corps of Engineers should allow a walrus-sized pothole to swallow tourists' cars on the way to the beach, or if a tree-trimmer's car should careen through some picnickers, these injuries would be `associated with' flood control. They would occur within the boundaries of the project, and but for the effort to curtail flooding the injuries would not have happened. Yet they would have nothing to do with management of flood waters, and it is hard to conceive that they are `damage from or by floods or flood waters' within the scope of &#167; 702c.' " &lt;i&gt;Fryman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 901 F. 2d, at 81. More to the point, such an approach is also inconsistent with the statutory language. See &lt;i&gt;infra,&lt;/i&gt; at 434.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  "Other circuits recognize that such a sweeping grant of immunity makes little sense in light of the text and purpose of the Act." &lt;i&gt;Cantrell&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;United States Dept. of Army Corps of Engineers,&lt;/i&gt; 89 F. 3d 268, 271 (CA6 1996). See also &lt;i&gt;Fryman,&lt;/i&gt; 901 F. 2d, at 81 ("&lt;i&gt;James&lt;/i&gt; was so broadly written that it cannot be applied literally").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  In addition to concluding that the word "damage" includes personal injury and death, the Court also rejected the previously arguable propositions that the Federal Government's subsequent waiver of sovereign immunity in the Federal Tort Claims Act had impliedly repealed &#167; 702c; and that the immunity applied only to the flood control on the Mississippi River authorized by the 1928 Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The Chowchilla flows in a westerly direction into the San Joaquin, which in turn flows in a northwesterly direction at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  In some exceptional circumstances, irrigation contractors may be obligated to buy Class 2 water at a particular time. However, contractors still pay for the water, regardless of the potential inconvenience with respect to the timing or date of delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;No. 99-1240.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;United States Supreme Court.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued October 11, 2000.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided February 21, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*358&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*358&lt;/span&gt; Rehnquist, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined. Kennedy, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which O'Connor, J., joined, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 374. Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 376.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jeffrey S. Sutton&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Bill Pryor,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General of Alabama, &lt;i&gt;Alice Ann Byrne&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Margaret L. Fleming,&lt;/i&gt; Assistant Attorneys General, &lt;i&gt;Gregory G. Katsas,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lisa Huggins.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Michael H. Gottesman&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Arlene Mayerson, Laurence Gold, Deborah Mattison, Sandra Reiss, Ira Burnim,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Jennifer Mathis.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging affirmance. With &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*359&lt;/span&gt; him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Assistant Attorney General Lee, Deputy Solicitor General Underwood, Patricia A. Millett, Jessica Dunsay Silver,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Seth M. Galanter.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*360&lt;/span&gt; Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decide here whether employees of the State of Alabama may recover money damages by reason of the State's failure to comply with the provisions of Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA or Act), 104 Stat. 330, 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 12111-12117.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; We hold that such suits are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADA prohibits certain employers, including the States, from "discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*361&lt;/span&gt; with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." &#167;&#167; 12112(a), 12111(2), (5), (7). To this end, the Act requires employers to "mak[e] reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless [the employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the [employer's] business." &#167; 12112(b)(5)(A).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"`[R]easonable accommodation' may include&#151; "(A) making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities; and (B) job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." &#167; 12111(9).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Act also prohibits employers from "utilizing standards, criteria, or methods of administration . . . that have the effect of discrimination on the basis of disability." &#167; 12112(b)(3)(A).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Act defines "disability" to include "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." &#167; 12102(2). A disabled individual is otherwise "qualified" if he or she, "with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." &#167; 12111(8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*362&lt;/span&gt; Respondent Patricia Garrett, a registered nurse, was employed as the Director of Nursing, OB/Gyn/Neonatal Services, for the University of Alabama in Birmingham Hospital. See App. 31, 38. In 1994, Garrett was diagnosed with breast cancer and subsequently underwent a lumpectomy, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 38. Garrett's treatments required her to take substantial leave from work. Upon returning to work in July 1995, Garrett's supervisor informed Garrett that she would have to give up her Director position. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 39. Garrett then applied for and received a transfer to another, lower paying position as a nurse manager. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent Milton Ash worked as a security officer for the Alabama Department of Youth Services (Department). See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 8. Upon commencing this employment, Ash informed the Department that he suffered from chronic asthma and that his doctor recommended he avoid carbon monoxide and cigarette smoke, and Ash requested that the Department modify his duties to minimize his exposure to these substances. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Ash was later diagnosed with sleep apnea and requested, again pursuant to his doctor's recommendation, that he be reassigned to daytime shifts to accommodate his condition. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 9. Ultimately, the Department granted none of the requested relief. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 8-9. Shortly after Ash filed a discrimination claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, he noticed that his performance evaluations were lower than those he had received on previous occasions. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garrett and Ash filed separate lawsuits in the District Court, both seeking money damages under the ADA.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Petitioners moved for summary judgment, claiming that the ADA exceeds Congress' authority to abrogate the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity. See &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/alnd/8QnZ/garrett-v-board-of-trustees-of-university-of-ala/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;989&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1409&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 1410 (ND Ala. 1998). In a single opinion disposing of both &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*363&lt;/span&gt; cases, the District Court agreed with petitioners' position and granted their motions for summary judgment. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 1410, 1412. The cases were consolidated on appeal to the Eleventh Circuit. The Court of Appeals reversed, 193 F. 3d 1214 (1999), adhering to its intervening decision in &lt;i&gt;Kimel&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State Bd. of Regents,&lt;/i&gt; 139 F. 3d 1426, 1433 (CA11 1998), aff'd, 528 U. S. 62 (2000), that the ADA validly abrogates the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We granted certiorari, 529 U. S. 1065 (2000), to resolve a split among the Courts of Appeals on the question whether an individual may sue a State for money damages in federal court under the ADA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eleventh Amendment provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although by its terms the Amendment applies only to suits against a State by citizens of another State, our cases have extended the Amendment's applicability to suits by citizens against their own States. See &lt;i&gt;Kimel&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Florida Bd. of Regents,&lt;/i&gt; 528 U. S. 62, 72-73 (2000); &lt;i&gt;College Savings Bank&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.,&lt;/i&gt; 527 U. S. 666, 669-670 (1999); &lt;i&gt;Seminole Tribe of Fla.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Florida,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S. 44, 54 (1996); &lt;i&gt;Hans&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Louisiana,&lt;/i&gt; 134 U. S. 1, 15 (1890). The ultimate guarantee of the Eleventh Amendment is that nonconsenting States may not be sued by private individuals in federal court. See &lt;i&gt;Kimel, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 73.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have recognized, however, that Congress may abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity when it both unequivocally intends to do so and "act[s] pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority." 528 U. S., at 73. The &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*364&lt;/span&gt; first of these requirements is not in dispute here. See 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12202 ("A State shall not be immune under the eleventh amendment to the Constitution of the United States from an action in [a] Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of this chapter"). The question, then, is whether Congress acted within its constitutional authority by subjecting the States to suits in federal court for money damages under the ADA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress may not, of course, base its abrogation of the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity upon the powers enumerated in Article I. See &lt;i&gt;Kimel, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 79 ("Under our firmly established precedent then, if the [Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967] rests solely on Congress' Article I commerce power, the private petitioners in today's cases cannot maintain their suits against their state employers"); &lt;i&gt;Seminole Tribe, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 72-73 ("The Eleventh Amendment restricts the judicial power under Article III, and Article I cannot be used to circumvent the constitutional limitations placed upon federal jurisdiction"); &lt;i&gt;College Savings Bank, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 672; &lt;i&gt;Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;College Savings Bank,&lt;/i&gt; 527 U. S. 627, 636 (1999); &lt;i&gt;Alden&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maine,&lt;/i&gt; 527 U. S. 706, 730-733 (1999). In &lt;i&gt;Fitzpatrick&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bitzer,&lt;/i&gt; 427 U. S. 445 (1976), however, we held that "the Eleventh Amendment, and the principle of state sovereignty which it embodies, are necessarily limited by the enforcement provisions of &#167; 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 456 (citation omitted). As a result, we concluded, Congress may subject nonconsenting States to suit in federal court when it does so pursuant to a valid exercise of its &#167; 5 power. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Our cases have adhered to this proposition. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kimel, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 80. Accordingly, the ADA can apply to the States only to the extent that the statute is appropriate &#167; 5 legislation.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*365&lt;/span&gt; Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides, in relevant part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment grants Congress the power to enforce the substantive guarantees contained in &#167; 1 by enacting "appropriate legislation." See &lt;i&gt;City of Boerne&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Flores,&lt;/i&gt; 521 U. S. 507, 536 (1997). Congress is not limited to mere legislative repetition of this Court's constitutional jurisprudence. "Rather, Congress' power `to enforce' the Amendment includes the authority both to remedy and to deter violation of rights guaranteed thereunder by prohibiting a somewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment's text." &lt;i&gt;Kimel, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 81; &lt;i&gt;City of Boerne, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 536.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;City of Boerne&lt;/i&gt; also confirmed, however, the long-settled principle that it is the responsibility of this Court, not Congress, to define the substance of constitutional guarantees. 521 U. S., at 519-524. Accordingly, &#167; 5 legislation reaching beyond the scope of &#167; 1's actual guarantees must exhibit "congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 520.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in applying these now familiar principles is to identify with some precision the scope of the constitutional right at issue. Here, that inquiry requires us to examine the limitations &#167; 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment places upon States' treatment of the disabled. As we did last Term in &lt;i&gt;Kimel,&lt;/i&gt; see 528 U. S., at 83, we look to our prior decisions under the Equal Protection Clause dealing with this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*366&lt;/span&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Cleburne&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cleburne Living Center, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 473 U. S. 432 (1985), we considered an equal protection challenge to a city ordinance requiring a special use permit for the operation of a group home for the mentally retarded. The specific question before us was whether the Court of Appeals had erred by holding that mental retardation qualified as a "quasi-suspect" classification under our equal protection jurisprudence. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 435. We answered that question in the affirmative, concluding instead that such legislation incurs only the minimum "rational-basis" review applicable to general social and economic legislation.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 446. In a statement that today seems quite prescient, we explained that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"if the large and amorphous class of the mentally retarded were deemed quasi-suspect for the reasons given by the Court of Appeals, it would be difficult to find a principled way to distinguish a variety of other groups who have perhaps immutable disabilities setting them off from others, who cannot themselves mandate the desired legislative responses, and who can claim some degree of prejudice from at least part of the public at large. One need mention in this respect only the aging, the disabled, the mentally ill, and the infirm. We are reluctant to set out on that course, and we decline to do so." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 445-446.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under rational-basis review, where a group possesses "distinguishing characteristics relevant to interests the State has the authority to implement," a State's decision &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*367&lt;/span&gt; to act on the basis of those differences does not give rise to a constitutional violation. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 441. "Such a classification cannot run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause if there is a rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose." &lt;i&gt;Heller&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Doe,&lt;/i&gt;  509 U. S. 312, 320 (1993) (citing &lt;i&gt;Nordlinger&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hahn,&lt;/i&gt; 505 U. S. 1 (1992); &lt;i&gt;New Orleans&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dukes,&lt;/i&gt; 427 U. S. 297, 303 (1976) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; ). Moreover, the State need not articulate its reasoning at the moment a particular decision is made. Rather, the burden is upon the challenging party to negative "`any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.' " &lt;i&gt;Heller, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 320 (quoting &lt;i&gt;FCC&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Beach Communications, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 508 U. S. 307, 313 (1993)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Breyer suggests that &lt;i&gt;Cleburne&lt;/i&gt; stands for the broad proposition that state decisionmaking reflecting "negative attitudes" or "fear" necessarily runs afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment. See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 382 (dissenting opinion) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Cleburne,&lt;/i&gt; 473 U. S., at 448). Although such biases may often accompany irrational (and therefore unconstitutional) discrimination, their presence alone does not a constitutional violation make. As we noted in &lt;i&gt;Cleburne:&lt;/i&gt; "[M]ere negative attitudes, or fear, &lt;i&gt;unsubstantiated by factors which are properly cognizable&lt;/i&gt; in a zoning proceeding, are not permissible bases for treating a home for the mentally retarded differently . . . ." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 448 (emphases added). This language, read in context, simply states the unremarkable and widely acknowledged tenet of this Court's equal protection jurisprudence that state action subject to rational-basis scrutiny does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment when it "rationally furthers the purpose identified by the State." &lt;i&gt;Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Murgia,&lt;/i&gt; 427 U. S. 307, 314 (1976) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the result of &lt;i&gt;Cleburne&lt;/i&gt; is that States are not required by the Fourteenth Amendment to make special accommodations for the disabled, so long as their actions toward such individuals are rational. They could quite hardheadedly&#151; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*368&lt;/span&gt; and perhaps hardheartedly&#151;hold to job-qualification requirements which do not make allowance for the disabled. If special accommodations for the disabled are to be required, they have to come from positive law and not through the Equal Protection Clause.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have determined the metes and bounds of the constitutional right in question, we examine whether Congress identified a history and pattern of unconstitutional employment discrimination by the States against the disabled. Just as &#167; 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment applies only to actions committed "under color of state law," Congress' &#167; 5 authority is appropriately exercised only in response to state transgressions. See &lt;i&gt;Florida Prepaid,&lt;/i&gt; 527 U. S., at 640 ("It is this conduct then&#151;unremedied patent infringement by the States&#151;that must give rise to the Fourteenth Amendment violation that Congress sought to redress in the Patent Remedy Act"); &lt;i&gt;Kimel,&lt;/i&gt; 528 U. S., at 89 ("Congress never identified any pattern of age discrimination by the States, much less any discrimination whatsoever that rose to the level of constitutional violation"). The legislative record of the ADA, however, simply fails to show that Congress did in fact identify a pattern of irrational state discrimination in employment against the disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondents contend that the inquiry as to unconstitutional discrimination should extend not only to States themselves, but to units of local governments, such as cities and counties. All of these, they say, are "state actors" for &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*369&lt;/span&gt; purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. Brief for Respondents 8. This is quite true, but the Eleventh Amendment does not extend its immunity to units of local government. See &lt;i&gt;Lincoln County&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Luning,&lt;/i&gt; 133 U. S. 529, 530 (1890). These entities are subject to private claims for damages under the ADA without Congress' ever having to rely on &#167; 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to render them so. It would make no sense to consider constitutional violations on their part, as well as by the States themselves, when only the States are the beneficiaries of the Eleventh Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress made a general finding in the ADA that "historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12101(a)(2). The record assembled by Congress includes many instances to support such a finding. But the great majority of these incidents do not deal with the activities of States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondents in their brief cite half a dozen examples from the record that did involve States. A department head at the University of North Carolina refused to hire an applicant for the position of health administrator because he was blind; similarly, a student at a state university in South Dakota was denied an opportunity to practice teach because the dean at that time was convinced that blind people could not teach in public schools. A microfilmer at the Kansas Department of Transportation was fired because he had epilepsy; deaf workers at the University of Oklahoma were paid a lower salary than those who could hear. The Indiana State Personnel Office informed a woman with a concealed disability that she should not disclose it if she wished to obtain employment.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*370&lt;/span&gt; Several of these incidents undoubtedly evidence an unwillingness on the part of state officials to make the sort of accommodations for the disabled required by the ADA. Whether they were irrational under our decision in &lt;i&gt;Cleburne&lt;/i&gt;  is more debatable, particularly when the incident is described out of context. But even if it were to be determined that each incident upon fuller examination showed unconstitutional action on the part of the State, these incidents taken together fall far short of even suggesting the pattern of unconstitutional discrimination on which &#167; 5 legislation must be based. See &lt;i&gt;Kimel, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 89-91; &lt;i&gt;City of Boerne,&lt;/i&gt; 521 U. S., at 530-531. Congress, in enacting the ADA, found that "some 43,000,000 Americans have one or more physical or mental disabilities." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12101(a)(1). In 1990, the States alone employed more than 4.5 million people. U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States 338 (119th ed. 1999) (Table 534). It is telling, we think, that given these large numbers, Congress assembled only such minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination in employment against the disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Breyer maintains that Congress applied Title I of the ADA to the States in response to a host of incidents representing unconstitutional state discrimination in employment against persons with disabilities. A close review of the relevant materials, however, undercuts that conclusion. Justice Breyer's Appendix C consists not of legislative findings, but of unexamined, anecdotal accounts of "adverse, disparate treatment by state officials." &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 379. Of course, as we have already explained, "adverse, disparate treatment" often does not amount to a constitutional violation where rational-basis scrutiny applies. These accounts, moreover, were submitted not directly to Congress but to the Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*371&lt;/span&gt; Americans with Disabilities, which made no findings on the subject of state discrimination in employment.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; See the Task Force's Report entitled From ADA to Empowerment (Oct. 12, 1990). And, had Congress truly understood this information as reflecting a pattern of unconstitutional behavior by the States, one would expect some mention of that conclusion in the Act's legislative findings. There is none. See 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12101. Although Justice Breyer would infer from Congress' general conclusions regarding societal discrimination against the disabled that the States had likewise participated in such action, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 378, the House and Senate committee reports on the ADA flatly contradict this assertion. After describing the evidence presented to the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources and its subcommittee (including the Task Force Report upon which the dissent relies), the Committee's Report reached, among others, the following conclusion: "Discrimination still persists in such critical areas as &lt;i&gt;employment in the private sector,&lt;/i&gt; public accommodations, public services, transportation, and telecommunications." S. Rep. No. 101-116, p. 6 (1989) (emphasis added). The House Committee on Education and Labor, addressing the ADA's employment provisions, reached the same conclusion: "[A]fter extensive review and analysis over a number of Congressional sessions, . . . there exists a compelling need to establish a clear and comprehensive Federal prohibition of discrimination on the basis of disability in the areas of &lt;i&gt;employment in the private sector,&lt;/i&gt; public accommodations, public services, transportation, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*372&lt;/span&gt; and telecommunications." H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, p. 28 (1990) (emphasis added). Thus, not only is the inference Justice Breyer draws unwarranted, but there is also strong evidence that Congress' failure to mention States in its legislative findings addressing discrimination in employment reflects that body's judgment that no pattern of unconstitutional state action had been documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even were it possible to squeeze out of these examples a pattern of unconstitutional discrimination by the States, the rights and remedies created by the ADA against the States would raise the same sort of concerns as to congruence and proportionality as were found in &lt;i&gt;City of Boerne, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; For example, whereas it would be entirely rational (and therefore constitutional) for a state employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees who are able to use existing facilities, the ADA requires employers to "mak[e] existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities." 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 12112(5)(B), 12111(9). The ADA does except employers from the "reasonable accommodatio[n]" requirement where the employer "can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity." &#167; 12112(b)(5)(A). However, even with this exception, the accommodation duty far exceeds what is constitutionally required in that it makes unlawful a range of alternative responses that would be reasonable but would fall short of imposing an "undue burden" upon the employer. The Act also makes it the employer's duty to prove that it would suffer such a burden, instead of requiring (as the Constitution does) that the complaining party negate reasonable bases for the employer's decision. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADA also forbids "utilizing standards, criteria, or methods of administration" that disparately impact the disabled, without regard to whether such conduct has a rational basis. &#167; 12112(b)(3)(A). Although disparate impact may be &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*373&lt;/span&gt; relevant evidence of racial discrimination, see &lt;i&gt;Washington&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Davis,&lt;/i&gt; 426 U. S. 229, 239 (1976), such evidence alone is insufficient even where the Fourteenth Amendment subjects state action to strict scrutiny. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., ibid.&lt;/i&gt; ("[O]ur cases have not embraced the proposition that a law or other official act, without regard to whether it reflects a racially discriminatory purpose, is unconstitutional &lt;i&gt;solely&lt;/i&gt; because it has a racially disproportionate impact").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADA's constitutional shortcomings are apparent when the Act is compared to Congress' efforts in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to respond to a serious pattern of constitutional violations. In &lt;i&gt;South Carolina&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Katzenbach,&lt;/i&gt; 383 U. S. 301 (1966), we considered whether the Voting Rights Act was "appropriate" legislation to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment's protection against racial discrimination in voting. Concluding that it was a valid exercise of Congress' enforcement power under &#167; 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment,&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; we noted that "[b]efore enacting the measure, Congress explored with great care the problem of racial discrimination in voting." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 308.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that Act, Congress documented a marked pattern of unconstitutional action by the States. State officials, Congress found, routinely applied voting tests in order to exclude African-American citizens from registering to vote. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 312. Congress also determined that litigation had proved ineffective and that there persisted an otherwise inexplicable 50-percentage-point gap in the registration of white and African-American voters in some States. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 313. Congress' response was to promulgate in the Voting Rights Act a detailed but limited remedial scheme designed to guarantee meaningful enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment in those areas of the Nation where abundant evidence of States' systematic denial of those rights was identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*374&lt;/span&gt; The contrast between this kind of evidence, and the evidence that Congress considered in the present case, is stark. Congressional enactment of the ADA represents its judgment that there should be a "comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12101(b)(1). Congress is the final authority as to desirable public policy, but in order to authorize private individuals to recover money damages against the States, there must be a pattern of discrimination by the States which violates the Fourteenth Amendment, and the remedy imposed by Congress must be congruent and proportional to the targeted violation. Those requirements are not met here, and to uphold the Act's application to the States would allow Congress to rewrite the Fourteenth Amendment law laid down by this Court in &lt;i&gt;Cleburne.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; Section 5 does not so broadly enlarge congressional authority. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice O'Connor joins, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prejudice, we are beginning to understand, rises not from malice or hostile animus alone. It may result as well from insensitivity caused by simple want of careful, rational reflection or from some instinctive mechanism to guard against people who appear to be different in some respects from ourselves. Quite apart from any historical documentation, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*375&lt;/span&gt; knowledge of our own human instincts teaches that persons who find it difficult to perform routine functions by reason of some mental or physical impairment might at first seem unsettling to us, unless we are guided by the better angels of our nature. There can be little doubt, then, that persons with mental or physical impairments are confronted with prejudice which can stem from indifference or insecurity as well as from malicious ill will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the undoubted achievements of statutes designed to assist those with impairments is that citizens have an incentive, flowing from a legal duty, to develop a better understanding, a more decent perspective, for accepting persons with impairments or disabilities into the larger society. The law works this way because the law can be a teacher. So I do not doubt that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 will be a milestone on the path to a more decent, tolerant, progressive society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a question of quite a different order, however, to say that the States in their official capacities, the States as governmental entities, must be held in violation of the Constitution on the assumption that they embody the misconceived or malicious perceptions of some of their citizens. It is a most serious charge to say a State has engaged in a pattern or practice designed to deny its citizens the equal protection of the laws, particularly where the accusation is based not on hostility but instead on the failure to act or the omission to remedy. States can, and do, stand apart from the citizenry. States act as neutral entities, ready to take instruction and to enact laws when their citizens so demand. The failure of a State to revise policies now seen as incorrect under a new understanding of proper policy does not always constitute the purposeful and intentional action required to make out a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. See &lt;i&gt;Washington&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Davis,&lt;/i&gt; 426 U. S. 229 (1976).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the reasons explained by the Court, an equal protection violation has not been shown with respect to the several States in this case. If the States had been transgressing &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*376&lt;/span&gt; the Fourteenth Amendment by their mistreatment or lack of concern for those with impairments, one would have expected to find in decisions of the courts of the States and also the courts of the United States extensive litigation and discussion of the constitutional violations. This confirming judicial documentation does not exist. That there is a new awareness, a new consciousness, a new commitment to better treatment of those disadvantaged by mental or physical impairments does not establish that an absence of state statutory correctives was a constitutional violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must be noted, moreover, that what is in question is not whether the Congress, acting pursuant to a power granted to it by the Constitution, can compel the States to act. What is involved is only the question whether the States can be subjected to liability in suits brought not by the Federal Government (to which the States have consented, see &lt;i&gt;Alden&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Maine,&lt;/i&gt; 527 U. S. 706, 755 (1999)), but by private persons seeking to collect moneys from the state treasury without the consent of the State. The predicate for money damages against an unconsenting State in suits brought by private persons must be a federal statute enacted upon the documentation of patterns of constitutional violations committed by the State in its official capacity. That predicate, for reasons discussed here and in the decision of the Court, has not been established. With these observations, I join the Court's opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the congressional record as if it were an administrative agency record, the Court holds the statutory provision before us, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12202, unconstitutional. The Court concludes that Congress assembled insufficient evidence of unconstitutional discrimination, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 370, that Congress improperly attempted to "rewrite" the law we established in &lt;i&gt;Cleburne&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cleburne Living Center, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 473 U. S. 432 (1985), &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 374, and that the law is not sufficiently &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*377&lt;/span&gt; tailored to address unconstitutional discrimination, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 372-373.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 5, however, grants Congress the "power to enforce, by appropriate legislation," the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection guarantee. U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, &#167; 5. As the Court recognizes, state discrimination in employment against persons with disabilities might "`run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause' " where there is no "`rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.' " &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 367 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Heller&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Doe,&lt;/i&gt; 509 U. S. 312, 320 (1993)). See also &lt;i&gt;Cleburne&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Cleburne Living Center, Inc., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 440 (stating that the Court will sustain a classification if it is "rationally related to a legitimate state interest"). In my view, Congress reasonably could have concluded that the remedy before us constitutes an "appropriate" way to enforce this basic equal protection requirement. And that is all the Constitution requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court says that its primary problem with this statutory provision is one of legislative evidence. It says that "Congress assembled only . . . minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination in employment." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 370. In fact, Congress compiled a vast legislative record documenting "`massive, society-wide discrimination' " against persons with disabilities. S. Rep. No. 101-116, pp. 8-9 (1989) (quoting testimony of Justin Dart, chairperson of the Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities). In addition to the information presented at 13 congressional hearings (see Appendix A, &lt;i&gt;infra&lt;/i&gt; ), and its own prior experience gathered over 40 years during which it contemplated and enacted considerable similar legislation (see Appendix B, &lt;i&gt;infra&lt;/i&gt; ), Congress created a special task force to assess the need for comprehensive legislation. That task force held hearings in every State, attended by more than 30,000 people, including thousands who had experienced discrimination first hand. See From ADA to Empowerment, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*378&lt;/span&gt; Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities 16 (Oct. 12, 1990) (hereinafter Task Force Report). The task force hearings, Congress' own hearings, and an analysis of "census data, national polls, and other studies" led Congress to conclude that "people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12101(a)(6). As to employment, Congress found that "[t]wo-thirds of all disabled Americans between the age of 16 and 64 [were] not working at all," even though a large majority wanted to, and were able to, work productively. S. Rep. No. 101-116, at 9. And Congress found that this discrimination flowed in significant part from "stereotypic assumptions" as well as "purposeful unequal treatment." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12101(a)(7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The powerful evidence of discriminatory treatment throughout society in general, including discrimination by private persons and local governments, implicates state governments as well, for state agencies form part of that same larger society. There is no particular reason to believe that they are immune from the "stereotypic assumptions" and pattern of "purposeful unequal treatment" that Congress found prevalent. The Court claims that it "make[s] no sense" to take into consideration constitutional violations committed by local governments. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 369. But the substantive obligation that the Equal Protection Clause creates applies to state and local governmental entities alike. &lt;i&gt;E. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Richmond&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;J. A. Croson Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 488 U. S. 469 (1989). Local governments often work closely with, and under the supervision of, state officials, and in general, state and local government employers are similarly situated. Nor is determining whether an apparently "local" entity is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity as simple as the majority suggests&#151;it often requires a "`detailed examination of the relevant provisions of [state] law.' " &lt;i&gt;Regents of Univ. of Cal.&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*379&lt;/span&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Doe,&lt;/i&gt; 519 U. S. 425, 430, n. 6 (1997) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Moor&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;County of Alameda,&lt;/i&gt; 411 U. S. 693, 719-721 (1973)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, there is no need to rest solely upon evidence of discrimination by local governments or general societal discrimination. There are roughly 300 examples of discrimination by state governments themselves in the legislative record. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Appendix C, &lt;i&gt;infra.&lt;/i&gt; I fail to see how this evidence "fall[s] far short of even suggesting the pattern of unconstitutional discrimination on which &#167; 5 legislation must be based." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 370.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The congressionally appointed task force collected numerous specific examples, provided by persons with disabilities themselves, of adverse, disparate treatment by state officials. They reveal, not what the Court describes as "half a dozen" instances of discrimination, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 369, but hundreds of instances of adverse treatment at the hands of state officials&#151; instances in which a person with a disability found it impossible to obtain a state job, to retain state employment, to use the public transportation that was readily available to others in order to get to work, or to obtain a public education, which is often a prerequisite to obtaining employment. State-imposed barriers also frequently made it difficult or impossible for people to vote, to enter a public building, to access important government services, such as calling for emergency assistance, and to find a place to live due to a pattern of irrational zoning decisions similar to the discrimination that we held unconstitutional in &lt;i&gt;Cleburne,&lt;/i&gt; 473 U. S., at 448. See Appendix C, &lt;i&gt;infra.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Court notes, those who presented instances of discrimination rarely provided additional, independent evidence sufficient to prove in court that, in each instance, the discrimination they suffered lacked justification from a judicial standpoint. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 370 (stating that instances of discrimination are "described out of context"). Perhaps this explains the Court's view that there is "minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; But a legislature &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*380&lt;/span&gt; is not a court of law. And Congress, unlike courts, must, and does, routinely draw general conclusions&#151;for example, of likely motive or of likely relationship to legitimate need&#151;from anecdotal and opinion-based evidence of this kind, particularly when the evidence lacks strong refutation. See Task Force Report 16, 20 (task force "met many times with significant representatives of groups opposed to [the] ADA," and as to the general public, although the task force received "about 2,000 letters" in support of the ADA, there was only "one letter in opposition"); S. Rep. No. 101-116, at 10 (summarizing testimony that many reasonable accommodations cost "less than $50," and the expense of others, such as hiring employees who can interpret for the deaf, is "frequently exaggerated"). In reviewing &#167; 5 legislation, we have never required the sort of extensive investigation of each piece of evidence that the Court appears to contemplate. Compare &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 370-371, with &lt;i&gt;Katzenbach&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Morgan,&lt;/i&gt; 384 U. S. 641, 652-656 (1966) (asking whether Congress' likely conclusions were reasonable, not whether there was adequate evidentiary support in the record). Nor has the Court traditionally required Congress to make findings as to state discrimination, or to break down the record evidence, category by category. Compare &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 371-372 (noting statements in two congressional Reports that mentioned state discrimination in public services and transportation but not in employment), with &lt;i&gt;Morgan, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 654 (considering what Congress "might" have concluded); 384 U. S., at 652 (holding that likely discrimination against Puerto Ricans in areas other than voting supported statute abolishing literacy test as qualification for voting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, Congress expressly found substantial unjustified discrimination against persons with disabilities. 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12101(9) (finding a pattern of "&lt;i&gt;unnecessary&lt;/i&gt; discrimination and prejudice" that "costs the United States billions of dollars in &lt;i&gt;unnecessary&lt;/i&gt; expenses resulting from dependency and nonproductivity" (emphasis added)). See also 2 Legislative History of the Americans with Disabilities &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*381&lt;/span&gt; Act (Leg. Hist.) (Committee Print compiled for the House Committee on Education and Labor), Ser. No. 102&#151;B, p. 1620 (1990) (testimony of Arlene B. Mayerson) (describing "unjustifiable and discriminatory loss of job opportunities"); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1623 (citing study showing "`strong evidence that employers' fears of low performance among disabled workers are unjustified' "). Moreover, it found that such discrimination typically reflects "stereotypic assumptions" or "purposeful unequal treatment." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12101(7). See also 2 Leg. Hist. 1622 (testimony of Arlene B. Mayerson) ("Outmoded stereotypes whether manifested in medical or other job `requirements' that are unrelated to the successful performance of the job, or in decisions based on the generalized perceptions of supervisors and hiring personnel, have excluded many disabled people from jobs for which they are qualified"). In making these findings, Congress followed our decision in &lt;i&gt;Cleburne,&lt;/i&gt; which established that not only discrimination against persons with disabilities that rests upon "`a bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group,' " 473 U. S., at 447 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Department of Agriculture&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Moreno,&lt;/i&gt; 413 U. S. 528, 534 (1973) (omission in &lt;i&gt;Cleburne&lt;/i&gt; )), violates the Fourteenth Amendment, but also discrimination that rests solely upon "negative attitude[s]," "fea[r]," 473 U. S., at 448, or "irrational prejudice," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 450. Adverse treatment that rests upon such motives is unjustified discrimination in &lt;i&gt;Cleburne'&lt;/i&gt; s terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence in the legislative record bears out Congress' finding that the adverse treatment of persons with disabilities was often arbitrary or invidious in this sense, and thus unjustified. For example, one study that was before Congress revealed that "most . . . governmental agencies in [one State] discriminated in hiring against job applicants for an average period of five years after treatment for cancer," based in part on coworkers' misguided belief that "cancer is contagious." 2 Leg. Hist. 1619-1620 (testimony of Arlene B. Mayerson). A school inexplicably refused to exempt a deaf teacher, who taught at a school for the deaf, from a &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*382&lt;/span&gt; "listening skills" requirement. Government's Lodging 1503. A State refused to hire a blind employee as director of an agency for the blind&#151;even though he was the most qualified applicant. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 974. Certain state agencies apparently had general policies against hiring or promoting persons with disabilities. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1159, 1577. A zoo turned away children with Downs Syndrome "because [the zookeeper] feared they would upset the chimpanzees." S. Rep. No. 101&#151; 116, at 7. There were reports of numerous zoning decisions based upon "negative attitudes" or "fear," &lt;i&gt;Cleburne, supra,&lt;/i&gt;  at 448, such as a zoning board that denied a permit for an obviously pretextual reason after hearing arguments that a facility would house "`deviants' " who needed "`room to roam,' " Government's Lodging 1068. A complete listing of the hundreds of examples of discrimination by state and local governments that were submitted to the task force is set forth in Appendix C, &lt;i&gt;infra.&lt;/i&gt; Congress could have reasonably believed that these examples represented signs of a widespread problem of unconstitutional discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court's failure to find sufficient evidentiary support may well rest upon its decision to hold Congress to a strict, judicially created evidentiary standard, particularly in respect to lack of justification. Justice Kennedy's empirical conclusion&#151;which rejects that of Congress&#151;rests heavily upon his failure to find "extensive litigation and discussion of the constitutional violations," in "&lt;i&gt;the courts&lt;/i&gt; of the United States." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 376 (concurring opinion) (emphasis added). And the Court itself points out that, when economic or social legislation is challenged in court as irrational, hence unconstitutional, the "burden is upon the challenging party to negative any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt;  at 367 (internal quotation marks omitted). Or as Justice Brandeis, writing for the Court, put the matter many years ago, "`if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*383&lt;/span&gt; would sustain' " challenged legislation, then "`there is a presumption of the existence of that state of facts, and one who assails the classification must carry the burden of showing . . . that the action is arbitrary.' " &lt;i&gt;Pacific States Box &amp;amp; Basket Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;White,&lt;/i&gt; 296 U. S. 176, 185 (1935) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Borden's Farm Products Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Baldwin,&lt;/i&gt; 293 U. S. 194, 209 (1934)). Imposing this special "burden" upon Congress, the Court fails to find in the legislative record sufficient indication that Congress has "negative[d]" the presumption that state action is rationally related to a legitimate objective. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 367.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with the Court's approach is that neither the "burden of proof" that favors States nor any other rule of restraint applicable to &lt;i&gt;judges&lt;/i&gt; applies to &lt;i&gt;Congress&lt;/i&gt; when it exercises its &#167; 5 power. "Limitations stemming from the nature of the judicial process . . . have no application to Congress." &lt;i&gt;Oregon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mitchell,&lt;/i&gt; 400 U. S. 112, 248 (1970) (Brennan, White, and Marshall, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Rational-basis review&#151;with its presumptions favoring constitutionality&#151;is "a paradigm of &lt;i&gt;judicial&lt;/i&gt; restraint." &lt;i&gt;FCC&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Beach Communications, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 508 U. S. 307, 314 (1993) (emphasis added). And the Congress of the United States is not a lower court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the Court in &lt;i&gt;Cleburne&lt;/i&gt; drew this very institutional distinction. We emphasized that "courts have been very reluctant, as they should be in our federal system and with our respect for the separation of powers, to closely scrutinize legislative choices." 473 U. S., at 441. Our invocation of judicial deference and respect for Congress was based on the fact that "[&#167; ]5 of the [Fourteenth] Amendment empowers &lt;i&gt;Congress&lt;/i&gt; to enforce [the equal protection] mandate." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 439 (emphasis added). Indeed, we made clear that the absence of a contrary congressional finding was critical to our decision to apply mere rational-basis review to disability discrimination claims&#151;a "congressional direction" to apply a more stringent standard would have been "controlling." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; See also &lt;i&gt;Washington&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Davis,&lt;/i&gt; 426 U. S. 229, 248 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*384&lt;/span&gt; (1976) (refusing to invalidate a law based on the Equal Protection Clause because a disparate-impact standard "should await legislative prescription"). Cf. &lt;i&gt;Mitchell, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 284 (Stewart, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("Congress may paint with a much broader brush than may this Court, which must confine itself to the judicial function of deciding individual cases and controversies upon individual records"). In short, the Court's claim that "to uphold the Act's application to the States would allow Congress to rewrite the Fourteenth Amendment law laid down by this Court in &lt;i&gt;Cleburne,&lt;/i&gt; " &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 374, is repudiated by &lt;i&gt;Cleburne&lt;/i&gt;  itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is simply no reason to require Congress, seeking to determine facts relevant to the exercise of its &#167; 5 authority, to adopt rules or presumptions that reflect a court's institutional limitations. Unlike courts, Congress can readily gather facts from across the Nation, assess the magnitude of a problem, and more easily find an appropriate remedy. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Cleburne, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 442-443 (addressing the problems of the "large and diversified group" of persons with disabilities "is a difficult and often a technical matter, very much a task for legislators guided by qualified professionals and not by the perhaps ill-informed opinions of the judiciary"). Unlike courts, Congress directly reflects public attitudes and beliefs, enabling Congress better to understand where, and to what extent, refusals to accommodate a disability amount to behavior that is callous or unreasonable to the point of lacking constitutional justification. Unlike judges, Members of Congress can directly obtain information from constituents who have firsthand experience with discrimination and related issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, unlike judges, Members of Congress are elected. When the Court has applied the majority's burden of proof rule, it has explained that we, &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; the courts, do not "`sit as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations.' " &lt;i&gt;Heller,&lt;/i&gt; 509 U. S., at 319 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*385&lt;/span&gt; (quoting &lt;i&gt;New Orleans&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dukes,&lt;/i&gt; 427 U. S. 297, 303 (1976) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; ). To apply a rule designed to restrict courts as if it restricted Congress' legislative power is to stand the underlying principle&#151;a principle of judicial restraint&#151; on its head. But without the use of this burden of proof rule or some other unusually stringent standard of review, it is difficult to see how the Court can find the legislative record here inadequate. Read with a reasonably favorable eye, the record indicates that state governments subjected those with disabilities to seriously adverse, disparate treatment. And Congress could have found, in a significant number of instances, that this treatment violated the substantive principles of justification&#151;shorn of their judicialrestraint-related presumptions&#151;that this Court recognized in &lt;i&gt;Cleburne.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court argues in the alternative that the statute's damages remedy is not "congruent" with and "proportional" to the equal protection problem that Congress found. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt;  at 374 (citing &lt;i&gt;City of Boerne&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Flores,&lt;/i&gt; 521 U. S. 507, 520 (1997)). The Court suggests that the Act's "reasonable accommodation" requirement, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12112(b)(5)(A), and disparate-impact standard, &#167; 12112(b)(3)(A), "far excee[d] what is constitutionally required." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 372. But we have upheld disparate-impact standards in contexts where they were not "constitutionally required." Compare &lt;i&gt;Griggs&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Duke Power Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 401 U. S. 424, 432 (1971), with &lt;i&gt;Washington, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 239, and &lt;i&gt;City of Rome&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 446 U. S. 156, 172-173 (1980), with &lt;i&gt;Mobile&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bolden,&lt;/i&gt; 446 U. S. 55, 62 (1980) (plurality opinion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is wrong with a remedy that, in response to unreasonable employer behavior, requires an employer to make accommodations that are reasonable? Of course, what is "reasonable" in the statutory sense and what is "unreasonable" in the constitutional sense might differ. In other words, the requirement may exceed what is necessary to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*386&lt;/span&gt; avoid a constitutional violation. But it is just that power&#151; the power to require more than the minimum&#151;that &#167; 5 grants to Congress, as this Court has repeatedly confirmed. As long ago as 1880, the Court wrote that &#167; 5 "brought within the domain of congressional power" whatever "tends to enforce submission" to its "prohibitions" and "to secure to all persons . . . the equal protection of the laws." &lt;i&gt;Ex parte Virginia,&lt;/i&gt; 100 U. S. 339, 346 (1880). More recently, the Court added that &#167; 5's "draftsmen sought to grant to Congress, by a specific provision applicable to the Fourteenth Amendment, the same broad powers expressed in the Necessary and Proper Clause, Art. I, &#167; 8, cl. 18." &lt;i&gt;Morgan,&lt;/i&gt; 384 U. S., at 650 (citing &lt;i&gt;McCulloch&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maryland,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/7LyH/mcculloch-v-maryland/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wheat.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;316&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 421 (1819)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping with these principles, the Court has said that "[i]t is not for us to review the congressional resolution of . . . the various conflicting considerations&#151;the risk or pervasiveness of the discrimination in governmental services . . . , the adequacy or availability of alternative remedies, and the nature and significance of the state interests that would be affected." 384 U. S., at 653. "It is enough that we be able to perceive a basis upon which the Congress might resolve the conflict as it did." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; See also &lt;i&gt;South Carolina&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Katzenbach,&lt;/i&gt; 383 U. S. 301, 324 (1966) (interpreting the similarly worded Enforcement Clause of the Fifteenth Amendment to permit Congress to use "any rational means to effectuate the constitutional prohibition"). Nothing in the words "reasonable accommodation" suggests that the requirement has no "tend[ency] to enforce" the Equal Protection Clause, &lt;i&gt;Ex parte Virginia, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 346, that it is an irrational way to achieve the objective, &lt;i&gt;Katzenbach, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 324, that it would fall outside the scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause, &lt;i&gt;Morgan, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 650, or that it somehow otherwise exceeds the bounds of the "appropriate," U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, &#167; 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court's more recent cases have professed to follow the longstanding principle of deference to Congress. See &lt;i&gt;Kimel&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*387&lt;/span&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Florida Bd. of Regents,&lt;/i&gt; 528 U. S. 62, 81 (2000) ("Congress' &#167; 5 power is not confined to the enactment of legislation that merely parrots the precise wording of the Fourteenth Amendment." Rather, Congress can prohibit a "somewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment's text"); &lt;i&gt;Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;College Savings Bank,&lt;/i&gt; 527 U. S. 627, 639 (1999) ("`Congress must have wide latitude' ") (quoting &lt;i&gt;City of Boerne, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 519-520); &lt;i&gt;City of Boerne, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 528 (reaffirming &lt;i&gt;Morgan&lt;/i&gt; ); 521 U. S., at 536 (Congress' "conclusions are entitled to much deference"). And even today, the Court purports to apply, not to depart from, these standards. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 365. But the Court's analysis and ultimate conclusion deprive its declarations of practical significance. The Court `sounds the word of promise to the ear but breaks it to the hope.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court's harsh review of Congress' use of its &#167; 5 power is reminiscent of the similar (now-discredited) limitation that it once imposed upon Congress' Commerce Clause power. Compare &lt;i&gt;Carter&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Carter Coal Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 298 U. S. 238 (1936), with &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Darby,&lt;/i&gt; 312 U. S. 100, 123 (1941) (rejecting &lt;i&gt;Carter Coal'&lt;/i&gt; s rationale). I could understand the legal basis for such review were we judging a statute that discriminated against those of a particular race or gender, see &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Virginia,&lt;/i&gt; 518 U. S. 515 (1996), or a statute that threatened a basic constitutionally protected liberty such as free speech, see &lt;i&gt;Reno&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Civil Liberties Union,&lt;/i&gt;  521 U. S. 844 (1997); see also Post &amp;amp; Siegel, Equal Protection by Law: Federal Antidiscrimination Legislation After &lt;i&gt;Morrison&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kimel,&lt;/i&gt; 110 Yale L. J. 441, 477 (2000) (stating that the Court's recent review of &#167; 5 legislation appears to approach strict scrutiny); 1 L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law &#167; 5-16, p. 959 (3d ed. 2000) (same). The legislation before us, however, does not discriminate against anyone, nor does it pose any threat to basic liberty. And it is difficult &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*388&lt;/span&gt; to understand why the Court, which applies "minimum `rational-basis' review" to statutes that &lt;i&gt;burden&lt;/i&gt; persons with disabilities, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 366, subjects to far stricter scrutiny a statute that seeks to &lt;i&gt;help&lt;/i&gt; those same individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recognize nonetheless that this statute imposes a burden upon States in that it removes their Eleventh Amendment protection from suit, thereby subjecting them to potential monetary liability. Rules for interpreting &#167; 5 that would provide States with special protection, however, run counter to the very object of the Fourteenth Amendment. By its terms, that Amendment prohibits &lt;i&gt;States&lt;/i&gt; from denying their citizens equal protection of the laws. U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, &#167; 1. Hence "principles of federalism that might otherwise be an obstacle to congressional authority are necessarily overridden by the power to enforce the Civil War Amendments `by appropriate legislation.' Those Amendments were specifically designed as an expansion of federal power and an intrusion on state sovereignty." &lt;i&gt;City of Rome,&lt;/i&gt; 446 U. S., at 179. See also &lt;i&gt;Fitzpatrick&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bitzer,&lt;/i&gt; 427 U. S. 445, 456 (1976); &lt;i&gt;Ex parte Virginia, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 345. And, ironically, the greater the obstacle the Eleventh Amendment poses to the creation by Congress of the kind of remedy at issue here&#151;the decentralized remedy of private damages actions&#151;the more Congress, seeking to cure important national problems, such as the problem of disability discrimination before us, will have to rely on more uniform remedies, such as federal standards and court injunctions, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12188(a)(2), which are sometimes draconian and typically more intrusive. See &lt;i&gt;College Savings Bank&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.,&lt;/i&gt; 527 U. S. 666, 704-705 (1999) (Breyer, J., dissenting). Cf. &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 374, n. 9. For these reasons, I doubt that today's decision serves any constitutionally based federalism interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court, through its evidentiary demands, its nondeferential review, and its failure to distinguish between judicial and legislative constitutional competencies, improperly invades a power that the Constitution assigns to Congress. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*389&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Morgan,&lt;/i&gt; 384 U. S., at 648, n. 7 (The "sponsors and supporters of the [Fourteenth] Amendment were primarily interested in augmenting the power of Congress"). Its decision saps &#167; 5 of independent force, effectively "confin[ing] the legislative power . . . to the insignificant role of abrogating only those state laws that the judicial branch [is] prepared to adjudge unconstitutional." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 648-649. Whether the Commerce Clause does or does not enable Congress to enact this provision, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seminole Tribe of Fla.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Florida,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S. 44, 100-185 (1996) (Souter, J., joined by Ginsburg and Breyer, JJ., dissenting); &lt;i&gt;College Savings Bank, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 699-700 (Breyer, J., dissenting), in my view, &#167; 5 gives Congress the necessary authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the reasons stated, I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

Stephen Hut, Jr.,&lt;/i&gt; filed a statement by former President George H. W. Bush as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Respondents' complaints in the United States District Court alleged violations of both Title I and Title II of the ADA, and petitioners' "Question Presented" can be read to apply to both sections. See Brief for Petitioners i; Brief for United States I. Though the briefs of the parties discuss both sections in their constitutional arguments, no party has briefed the question whether Title II of the ADA, dealing with the "services, programs, or activities of a public entity," 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12132, is available for claims of employment discrimination when Title I of the ADA expressly deals with that subject. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Russello&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) ("[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion" (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Courts of Appeals are divided on this issue, compare &lt;i&gt;Zimmerman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Oregon Dept. of Justice,&lt;/i&gt; 170 F. 3d 1169 (CA9 1999), with &lt;i&gt;Bledsoe&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Palm Beach Cty. Soil &amp;amp; Water Conservation Dist.,&lt;/i&gt; 133 F. 3d 816 (CA11 1998). We are not disposed to decide the constitutional issue whether Title II, which has somewhat different remedial provisions from Title I, is appropriate legislation under &#167; 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment when the parties have not favored us with briefing on the statutory question. To the extent the Court granted certiorari on the question whether respondents may sue their state employers for damages under Title II of the ADA, see this Court's Rule 24.1(a), that portion of the writ is dismissed as improvidently granted. See &lt;i&gt;The Monrosa&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Carbon Black Export, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 359 U. S. 180, 184 (1959).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Garrett raised other claims, but those are not presently before the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  It is clear that Congress intended to invoke &#167; 5 as one of its bases for enacting the ADA. See 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12101(b)(4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Applying the basic principles of rationality review, &lt;i&gt;Cleburne&lt;/i&gt; struck down the city ordinance in question. 473 U. S., at 447-450. The Court's reasoning was that the city's purported justifications for the ordinance made no sense in light of how the city treated other groups similarly situated in relevant respects. Although the group home for the mentally retarded was required to obtain a special use permit, apartment houses, other multiple-family dwellings, retirement homes, nursing homes, sanitariums, hospitals, boarding houses, fraternity and sorority houses, and dormitories were not subject to the ordinance. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  It is worth noting that by the time that Congress enacted the ADA in 1990, every State in the Union had enacted such measures. At least one Member of Congress remarked that "this is probably one of the few times where the States are so far out in front of the Federal Government, it's not funny." Hearing on Discrimination Against Cancer Victims and the Handicapped before the Subcommittee on Employment Opportunities of the House Committee on Education and Labor, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1987). A number of these provisions, however, did not go as far as the ADA did in requiring accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  The record does show that some States, adopting the tenets of the eugenics movement of the early part of this century, required extreme measures such as sterilization of persons suffering from hereditary mental disease. These laws were upheld against constitutional attack 70 years ago in &lt;i&gt;Buck&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bell,&lt;/i&gt; 274 U. S. 200 (1927). But there is no indication that any State had persisted in requiring such harsh measures as of 1990 when the ADA was adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  Only a small fraction of the anecdotes Justice Breyer identifies in his Appendix C relate to state discrimination against the disabled in employment. At most, somewhere around 50 of these allegations describe conduct that could conceivably amount to constitutional violations by the States, and most of them are so general and brief that no firm conclusion can be drawn. The overwhelming majority of these accounts pertain to alleged discrimination by the States in the provision of public services and public accommodations, which areas are addressed in Titles II and III of the ADA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment is virtually identical to &#167; 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9]  Our holding here that Congress did not validly abrogate the States' sovereign immunity from suit by private individuals for money damages under Title I does not mean that persons with disabilities have no federal recourse against discrimination. Title I of the ADA still prescribes standards applicable to the States. Those standards can be enforced by the United States in actions for money damages, as well as by private individuals in actions for injunctive relief under &lt;i&gt;Ex parte Young,&lt;/i&gt; 209 U. S. 123 (1908). In addition, state laws protecting the rights of persons with disabilities in employment and other aspects of life provide independent avenues of redress. See n. 5, &lt;i&gt;supra.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*343&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Irving L. Gornstein&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Ogden, Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler, Douglas N. Letter, Peter J. Smith, Margaret Jane Porter,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Patricia J. Kaeding.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Michael D. Fishbein&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Arnold Levin, Sandra L. Duggan,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;John J. Cummings III.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent represents plaintiffs who claim injuries resulting from the use of orthopedic bone screws in the pedicles of their spines. Petitioner is a consulting company that assisted the screws' manufacturer, AcroMed Corporation, in navigating the federal regulatory process for these devices. Plaintiffs say petitioner made fraudulent representations to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Administration) in the course of obtaining approval to market the screws. Plaintiffs further claim that such representations were at least a "but for" cause of injuries that plaintiffs sustained from the implantation of these devices: Had the representations not been made, the FDA would not have approved the devices, and plaintiffs would not have been injured. Plaintiffs sought damages from petitioner under state tort law. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*344&lt;/span&gt; We hold that such claims are pre-empted by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 52 Stat. 1040, as amended by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA), 90 Stat. 539, 21 U. S. C. &#167; 301 (1994 ed. and Supp. V).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulation of medical devices is governed by the two Acts just named. The MDA separates devices into three categories: Class I devices are those that present no unreasonable risk of illness or injury and therefore require only general manufacturing controls; Class II devices are those possessing a greater potential dangerousness and thus warranting more stringent controls; Class III devices "presen[t] a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury" and therefore incur the FDA's strictest regulation. &#167; 360c(a)(1)(C)(ii)(II). It is not disputed that the bone screws manufactured by AcroMed are Class III devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class III devices must complete a thorough review process with the FDA before they may be marketed. This premarket approval (PMA) process requires the applicant to demonstrate a "reasonable assurance" that the device is both "safe . . . [and] effective under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof." &#167;&#167; 360e(d)(2)(A), (B). Among other information, an application must include all known reports pertaining to the device's safety and efficacy, see &#167; 360e(c)(1)(A); "a full statement of the components, ingredients, and properties and of the principle or principles of operation of such device," &#167; 360e(c)(1)(B); "a full description of the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and, when relevant, packing and installation of, such device," &#167; 360e(c)(1)(C); samples of the device (when practicable), see &#167; 360e(c)(1)(E); and "specimens of the labeling proposed to be used for such device," &#167; 360e(c)(1)(F). The PMA process is ordinarily quite time consuming because &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*345&lt;/span&gt; the FDA's review requires an "average of 1,200 hours [for] each submission." &lt;i&gt;Medtronic, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lohr,&lt;/i&gt; 518 U. S. 470, 477 (1996) (citing Hearings before the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment of the House Committee on Energy &amp;amp; Commerce, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (Ser. No. 100-34), p. 384 (1987); Kahan, Premarket Approval Versus Premarket Notification: Different Routes to the Same Market, 39 Food Drug Cosm. L. J. 510, 512-514 (1984)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exception to the PMA requirement exists for devices that were already on the market prior to the MDA's enactment in 1976. See 21 U. S. C. &#167; 360e(b)(1)(A). The MDA allows these "predicate" devices to remain available until the FDA initiates and completes the PMA process. In order to avoid the potentially monopolistic consequences of this predicate-device exception, the MDA allows other manufacturers to distribute (also pending completion of the predicate device's PMA review) devices that are shown to be "substantially equivalent" to a predicate device. &#167; 360e(b)(1)(B).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demonstrating that a device qualifies for this exception is known as the "&#167; 510(k) process," which refers to the section of the original MDA containing this provision. Section 510(k) submissions must include the following: "Proposed labels, labeling, and advertisements sufficient to describe the device, its intended use, and the directions for its use," 21 CFR &#167; 807.87(e) (2000); "[a] statement indicating the device is similar to and/or different from other products of comparable type in commercial distribution, accompanied by data to support the statement," &#167; 807.87(f); "[a] statement that the submitter believes, to the best of his or her knowledge, that all data and information submitted in the premarket notification are truthful and accurate and that no material fact has been omitted," &#167; 807.87(k); and "[a]ny additional information regarding the device requested by the [FDA] Commissioner that is necessary for the Commissioner to make a finding as to whether or not the device is substantially &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*346&lt;/span&gt; equivalent to a device in commercial distribution," &#167; 807.87(l).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1984, AcroMed sought &#167; 510(k) approval for its bone screw device, indicating it for use in spinal surgery. See &lt;i&gt;In re Orthopedic Bone Screw Products Liability Litigation,&lt;/i&gt;  159 F. 3d 817, 820 (CA3 1998). The FDA denied approval on the grounds that the Class III device lacked substantial equivalence to a predicate device. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; In September 1985, with the assistance of petitioner, AcroMed filed another &#167; 510(k) application. "The application provided additional information about the . . . device and again indicated its intended use in spinal surgery. The FDA again rejected the application, determining that the device was not substantially equivalent to a predicate device and that it posed potential risks not exhibited by other spinal-fixation systems." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; In December 1985, AcroMed and petitioner filed a third &#167; 510(k) application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"AcroMed and [petitioner] split the . . . device in to its component parts, renamed them `nested bone plates' and `[cancellous] bone screws' and filed a separate &#167; 510(k) application for each component. In both applications, a new intended use was specified: rather than seeking clearance for spinal applications, they sought clearance to market the plates and screws for use in the long bones of the arms and legs. AcroMed and Buckman claimed that the two components were substantially equivalent to predicate devices used in long bone surgery. The FDA approved the devices for this purpose in February 1986." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursuant to its designation by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation as the transferee court for &lt;i&gt;In re: Orthopedic Bone Screw Liability Litigation,&lt;/i&gt; MDL No. 1014, the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania has been the recipient of some 2,300 civil actions related to these medical devices. Many of these actions include state-law &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*347&lt;/span&gt; causes of action claiming that petitioner and AcroMed made fraudulent representations to the FDA as to the intended use of the bone screws and that, as a result, the devices were improperly given market clearance and were subsequently used to the plaintiffs' detriment. The District Court dismissed these "fraud-on-the-FDA" claims, first on the ground that they were expressly pre-empted by the MDA, and then, after our decision in &lt;i&gt;Medtronic,&lt;/i&gt; on the ground that these claims amounted to an improper assertion of a private right of action under the MDA.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; See 159 F. 3d, at 821.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, concluding that plaintiffs' fraud claims were neither expressly nor impliedly pre-empted. We granted certiorari, 530 U. S. 1273 (2000), to resolve a split among the Courts of Appeals on this question, see &lt;i&gt;Kemp&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Medtronic, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 231 F. 3d 216, 233-236 (CA6 2000) (identifying split and holding such claims expressly pre-empted), and we now reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policing fraud against federal agencies is hardly "a field which the States have traditionally occupied," &lt;i&gt;Rice&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947), such as to warrant a presumption against finding federal pre-emption of a state-law cause of action. To the contrary, the relationship between a federal agency and the entity it regulates is inherently federal in character because the relationship originates from, is governed by, and terminates according to federal law. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Boyle&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United Technologies Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 487 U. S. 500, 504-505 (1988) (allowing pre-emption of state law by federal common law where the interests at stake are "uniquely federal" in nature). Here, petitioner's dealings with the FDA were prompted by the MDA, and the very subject matter &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*348&lt;/span&gt; of petitioner's statements were dictated by that statute's provisions. Accordingly&#151;and in contrast to situations implicating "federalism concerns and the historic primacy of state regulation of matters of health and safety," &lt;i&gt;Medtronic,&lt;/i&gt;  518 U. S., at 485&#151;no presumption against pre-emption obtains in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this analytical framework, we hold that the plaintiffs' state-law fraud-on-the-FDA claims conflict with, and are therefore impliedly pre-empted by, federal law.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; The conflict stems from the fact that the federal statutory scheme amply empowers the FDA to punish and deter fraud against the Administration, and that this authority is used by the Administration to achieve a somewhat delicate balance of statutory objectives. The balance sought by the Administration can be skewed by allowing fraud-on-the-FDA claims under state tort law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As described in greater detail above, the &#167; 510(k) process sets forth a comprehensive scheme for determining whether an applicant has demonstrated that a product is substantially equivalent to a predicate device. Among other information, the applicant must submit to the FDA "[p]roposed labels, labeling, and advertisements sufficient to describe the device, its intended use, and the directions for its use," 21 CFR &#167; 807.87(e) (2000), and a statement attesting to and explaining the similarities to and/or differences from similar devices (along with supporting data), see &#167; 807.87(f). The FDA is also empowered to require additional necessary information. See &#167; 807.87(l). Admittedly, the &#167; 510(k) process lacks the PMA review's rigor: The former requires only a showing of substantial equivalence to a predicate device, while the latter involves a time-consuming inquiry into the risks and efficacy of each device. Nevertheless, to achieve its limited purpose, the &#167; 510(k) process imposes upon applicants a variety of requirements that are designed to enable the FDA to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*349&lt;/span&gt; make its statutorily required judgment as to whether the device qualifies under this exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accompanying these disclosure requirements are various provisions aimed at detecting, deterring, and punishing false statements made during this and related approval processes. The FDA is empowered to investigate suspected fraud, see 21 U. S. C. &#167; 372; 21 CFR &#167; 5.35 (2000), and citizens may report wrongdoing and petition the agency to take action, &#167; 10.30. In addition to the general criminal proscription on making false statements to the Federal Government, 18 U. S. C. &#167; 1001 (1994 ed., Supp. V),&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; the FDA may respond to fraud by seeking injunctive relief, 21 U. S. C. &#167; 332, and civil penalties, 21 U. S. C. &#167; 333(f)(1)(A); seizing the device, &#167; 334(a)(2)(D); and pursuing criminal prosecutions, &#167; 333(a). The FDA&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; thus has at its disposal a variety of enforcement options that allow it to make a measured response to suspected fraud upon the Administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This flexibility is a critical component of the statutory and regulatory framework under which the FDA pursues difficult (and often competing) objectives. For example, with respect to Class III devices, the FDA simultaneously maintains the exhaustive PMA and the more limited &#167; 510(k) processes in order to ensure both that medical devices are &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*350&lt;/span&gt; reasonably safe and effective and that, if the device qualifies under the &#167; 510(k) exception, it is on the market within a relatively short period of time. Similarly, "off-label" usage of medical devices (use of a device for some other purpose than that for which it has been approved by the FDA) is an accepted and necessary corollary of the FDA's mission to regulate in this area without directly interfering with the practice of medicine. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Beck &amp;amp; Azari, FDA, OffLabel Use, and Informed Consent: Debunking Myths and Misconceptions, 53 Food &amp;amp; Drug L. J. 71, 76-77 (1998) (noting that courts, several States, and the "FDA itself recogniz[e] the value and propriety of off-label use"). Indeed, a recent amendment to the FDCA expressly states in part that "[n]othing in this chapter shall be construed to limit or interfere with the authority of a health care practitioner to prescribe or administer any legally marketed device to a patient for any condition or disease within a legitimate health care practitioner-patient relationship." 21 U. S. C. &#167; 396 (1994 ed., Supp. V). Thus, the FDA is charged with the difficult task of regulating the marketing and distribution of medical devices without intruding upon decisions statutorily committed to the discretion of health care professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-law fraud-on-the-FDA claims inevitably conflict with the FDA's responsibility to police fraud consistently with the Administration's judgment and objectives. As a practical matter, complying with the FDA's detailed regulatory regime in the shadow of 50 States' tort regimes will dramatically increase the burdens facing potential applicants&#151;burdens not contemplated by Congress in enacting the FDCA and the MDA. Would-be applicants may be discouraged from seeking &#167; 510(k) approval of devices with potentially beneficial off-label uses for fear that such use might expose the manufacturer or its associates (such as petitioner) to unpredictable civil liability. In effect, then, fraud-on-the-FDA claims could cause the Administration's reporting requirements to deter off-label use despite the fact that the FDCA &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*351&lt;/span&gt; expressly disclaims any intent to directly regulate the practice of medicine, see 21 U. S. C. &#167; 396 (1994 ed., Supp. V), and even though off-label use is generally accepted.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, fraud-on-the-FDA claims would also cause applicants to fear that their disclosures to the FDA, although deemed appropriate by the Administration, will later be judged insufficient in state court. Applicants would then have an incentive to submit a deluge of information that the Administration neither wants nor needs, resulting in additional burdens on the FDA's evaluation of an application. As a result, the comparatively speedy &#167; 510(k) process could encounter delays, which would, in turn, impede competition among predicate devices and delay health care professionals' ability to prescribe appropriate off-label uses.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent relies heavily on &lt;i&gt;Silkwood&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kerr-McGee Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 464 U. S. 238 (1984), which it reads to "creat[e] a virtually irrefutable presumption against implied preemption of private damage remedies predicated on an alleged conflict with a federal remedial scheme." Brief for Respondent 34. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*352&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Silkwood&lt;/i&gt; is different from the present case, however, in several respects. Silkwood's claim was not based on any sort of fraud-on-the-agency theory, but on traditional state tort law principles of the duty of care owed by the producer of plutonium fuel pins to an employee working in its plant. See 464 U. S., at 241. Moreover, our decision there turned on specific statutory evidence that Congress "disclaimed any interest in promoting the development and utilization of atomic energy by means that fail to provide adequate remedies for those who are injured by exposure to hazardous nuclear materials." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 257. In the present case, by contrast, we have clear evidence that Congress intended that the MDA be enforced exclusively by the Federal Government. 21 U. S. C. &#167; 337(a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent also suggests that we should be reluctant to find a pre-emptive conflict here because Congress included an express pre-emption provision in the MDA. See Brief for Respondent 37. To the extent respondent posits that anything other than our ordinary pre-emption principles apply under these circumstances, that contention must fail in light of our conclusion last Term in &lt;i&gt;Geier&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Honda Motor Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S. 861 (2000), that neither an express pre-emption provision nor a saving clause "bar[s] the ordinary working of conflict pre-emption principles." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 869.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must also reject respondent's attempt to characterize both the claims at issue in &lt;i&gt;Medtronic&lt;/i&gt; (common-law negligence action against the manufacturer of an allegedly defective pacemaker lead) and the fraud claims here as "claims arising from violations of FDCA requirements." Brief for Respondent 38. Notwithstanding the fact that &lt;i&gt;Medtronic&lt;/i&gt;  did not squarely address the question of implied pre-emption, it is clear that the &lt;i&gt;Medtronic&lt;/i&gt; claims arose from the manufacturer's alleged failure to use reasonable care in the production of the product, not solely from the violation of FDCA requirements. See 518 U. S., at 481. In the present case, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*353&lt;/span&gt; however, the fraud claims exist solely by virtue of the FDCA disclosure requirements. Thus, although &lt;i&gt;Medtronic&lt;/i&gt; can be read to allow certain state-law causes of actions that parallel federal safety requirements, it does not and cannot stand for the proposition that any violation of the FDCA will support a state-law claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, were plaintiffs to maintain their fraud-on-theagency claims here, they would not be relying on traditional state tort law which had predated the federal enactments in questions. On the contrary, the existence of these federal enactments is a critical element in their case. For the reasons stated above, we think this sort of litigation would exert an extraneous pull on the scheme established by Congress, and it is therefore pre-empted by that scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Court points out, an essential link in the chain of causation that respondent must prove in order to prevail is that, but for petitioner's fraud, the allegedly defective orthopedic bone screws would not have reached the market. The fact that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has done nothing to remove the devices from the market, even though it is aware of the basis for the fraud allegations, convinces me that this essential element of the claim cannot be proved. I therefore agree that the case should not proceed.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*354&lt;/span&gt; This would be a different case if, prior to the instant litigation, the FDA had determined that petitioner had committed fraud during the &#167; 510(k) process and had then taken the necessary steps to remove the harm-causing product from the market. Under those circumstances, respondent's state-law fraud claim would not depend upon speculation as to the FDA's behavior in a counter factual situation but would be grounded in the agency's explicit actions. In such a case, a plaintiff would be able to establish causation without second-guessing the FDA's decisionmaking or overburdening its personnel, thereby alleviating the Government's central concerns regarding fraud-on-the-agency claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the FDA determines both that fraud has occurred and that such fraud requires the removal of a product from the market, state damages remedies would not encroach upon, but rather would supplement and facilitate, the federal enforcement scheme. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Medtronic, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lohr,&lt;/i&gt; 518 U. S. 470, 495 (1996) (holding that the presence of a state-law damages remedy for violations of FDA requirements does not impose an additional requirement upon medical device manufacturers but "merely provides another reason for manufacturers to comply with . . . federal law"); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 513 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (same).&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*355&lt;/span&gt; Under the pre-emption analysis the Court offers today, however, parties injured by fraudulent representations to federal agencies would have no remedy even if recognizing such a remedy would have no adverse consequences upon the operation or integrity of the regulatory process. I do not believe the reasons advanced in the Court's opinion support the conclusion that Congress intended such a harsh result. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Silkwood&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kerr-McGee Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 464 U. S. 238, 251 (1984) (declining to infer that a federal statutory scheme that affords no alternative means of seeking redress pre-empted traditional state-law remedies). For that reason, although I concur in the Court's disposition of this case, I do not join its opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   Briefs of &lt;i&gt;amici curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal were filed for the Medical Device Manufacturers Association by &lt;i&gt;Daniel G. Jarcho, Donald R. Stone,&lt;/i&gt;  and &lt;i&gt;Larry R. Pilot;&lt;/i&gt; for Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc., by &lt;i&gt;James M. Beck&lt;/i&gt;  and &lt;i&gt;Stephen S. Phillips;&lt;/i&gt; for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America by &lt;i&gt;Bert W. Rein, Daniel E. Troy,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Jennifer A. Shah;&lt;/i&gt; for the Product Liability Advisory Council, Inc., by &lt;i&gt;Malcolm E. Wheeler;&lt;/i&gt; and for the Washington Legal Foundation by &lt;i&gt;Daniel J. Popeo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Richard A. Samp.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefs of &lt;i&gt;amici curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging affirmance were filed for the Association of Trial Lawyers of America by &lt;i&gt;Jeffrey Robert White&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Frederick M. Baron;&lt;/i&gt; and for Public Citizen by &lt;i&gt;Allison M. Zieve, Brian Wolfman,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Alan Morrison.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The District Court also determined that the plaintiffs' fraud claims failed for lack of proximate cause, see &lt;i&gt;In re Orthopedic Bone Screw Products Liability Litigation,&lt;/i&gt; 159 F. 3d 817, 821 (CA3 1998), but that question is not presently before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  In light of this conclusion, we express no view on whether these claims are subject to express pre-emption under 21 U. S. C. &#167; 360k.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Title 18 U. S. C. &#167; 1001(a) (1994 ed., Supp. V) provides: "[W]hoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; [or]makes any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation; or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry; shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  The FDCA leaves no doubt that it is the Federal Government rather than private litigants who are authorized to file suit for noncompliance with the medical device provisions: "[A]ll such proceedings for the enforcement, or to restrain violations, of this chapter shall be by and in the name of the United States." 21 U. S. C.&#167; 337(a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  See Green &amp;amp; Schultz, Tort Law Deference to FDA Regulation of Medical Devices, 88 Geo. L. J. 2119, 2133 (2000) ("Physicians may prescribe drugs and devices for off-label uses"); Smith, Physician Modification of Legally Marketed Medical Devices: Regulatory Implications Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 55 Food &amp;amp; Drug L. J. 245, 251-252 (2000) (discussing off-label use in terms of the "practice of medicine doctrine[, which] stands firmly for the proposition that regulatory efforts are directed primarily at device marketing by manufacturers, not device use by physicians"); Beck &amp;amp; Azari, FDA, Off-Label Use, and Informed Consent: Debunking Myths and Misconceptions, 53 Food &amp;amp; Drug L. J. 71, 72 (1998) ("Off-label use is widespread in the medical community and often is essential to giving patients optimal medical care, both of which medical ethics, FDA, and most courts recognize").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  In light of the likely impact that the fraud-on-the-FDA claims would have on the administration of the Administration's duties, we must reject respondent's contention that these claims "will . . . affect only the litigants and will not have the kind of direct impact on the United States, which preemption is designed to protect from undue incursion." Brief for Respondent 30 (citing &lt;i&gt;Miree&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;DeKalb County,&lt;/i&gt; 433 U. S. 25 (1977)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Though my analysis focuses on the failure of the plaintiffs to establish a necessary element of their claim, that failure is grounded not in the minutiae of state law but in the details of the federal regulatory system for medical devices. Therefore, while this case does not fit neatly into our pre-existing pre-emption jurisprudence, it is accurate,in a sense, to say that federal law "pre-empts" this state-law fraud-on-the-FDA claim because the FDA has not acknowledged such a fraud and taken steps to remove the device from the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Though the United States in this case appears to take the position that fraud-on-the-FDA claims conflict with the federal enforcement scheme even when the FDA has publicly concluded that it was defrauded and taken all the necessary steps to remove a device from the market, see Brief for United States as &lt;i&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 24, 30, that has not always been its position. As recently as 1994, the United States took the position that state-law tort suits alleging fraud in FDA applications for medical devices do not conflict with federal law where the FDA has "subsequently concluded" that the device in question never met the appropriate federal requirements and "initiated enforcement actions" against those responsible for fraudulently obtaining its approval. Brief for United States as &lt;i&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Talbott&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;C. R. Bard, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; No. 94-1951 (CA1), reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. in &lt;i&gt;Talbott&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;C. R. Bard., Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; O. T. 1995, No. 95-1321, p. 84a.&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*440&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*440&lt;/span&gt; O'Connor, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Roy C. Dripps&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs was &lt;i&gt;Gail G. Renshaw.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;James V. O'Brien&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice O'Connor, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case concerns a seaman's ability to sue a vessel owner in state court for personal injuries sustained aboard a vessel. Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over admiralty and maritime claims, but the jurisdictional statute "sav[es] to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled." 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1333(1). Another statute grants vessel owners the right to seek limited liability in federal court for claims of damage aboard their vessels. 46 U. S. C. App. &#167; 181 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; In this case, the District Court, after conducting proceedings to preserve the vessel owner's right to seek limited liability, dissolved the injunction that prevented the seaman from litigating his personal injury claims in state court. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the vessel owner had a right to contest liability in federal court, and that the seaman did not have a saved remedy in state court. The question presented is whether the District Court abused its discretion in dissolving the injunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner, James F. Lewis, worked as a deckhand aboard the M/V &lt;i&gt;Karen Michelle,&lt;/i&gt; owned by respondent, Lewis &amp;amp; Clark Marine, Inc. Petitioner claims that on March 17, 1998, he was injured aboard the M/V &lt;i&gt;Karen Michelle&lt;/i&gt; when he tripped over a wire and hurt his back. App. 12. In April 1998, petitioner sued respondent in the Circuit Court of Madison &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*441&lt;/span&gt; County, Illinois. Petitioner claimed negligence under the Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. &#167; 688, unseaworthiness, and maintenance and cure. A Jones Act claim is an &lt;i&gt;in personam&lt;/i&gt;  action for a seaman who suffers injury in the course of employment due to negligence of his employer, the vessel owner, or crew members. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Plamals&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;S. S. "Pinar Del Rio,"&lt;/i&gt; 277 U. S. 151, 155-156 (1928). Unseaworthiness is a claim under general maritime law based on the vessel owner's duty to ensure that the vessel is reasonably fit to be at sea. See generally &lt;i&gt;Mitchell&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Trawler Racer, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 362 U. S. 539, 550 (1960). A claim for maintenance and cure concerns the vessel owner's obligation to provide food, lodging, and medical services to a seaman injured while serving the ship. See generally &lt;i&gt;Calmar S. S. Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Taylor,&lt;/i&gt; 303 U. S. 525, 527-528 (1938). Petitioner did not demand a jury trial in state court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of petitioner's suit, respondent had filed a complaint for exoneration from, or limitation of, liability in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri pursuant to the Limitation of Liability Act (Limitation Act or Act), 46 U. S. C. App. &#167; 181 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; The District Court followed the procedure for a limitation action provided in Supplemental Admiralty and Maritime Claims Rule F. The court entered an order approving a surety bond of $450,000, representing respondent's interest in the vessel. The court ordered that any person with a claim for the events of March 17, 1998, file a claim with the court within a specified period. The court then enjoined the filing or prosecution of any suits against respondent related to the incident on March 17, 1998. App. 30-33.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner filed an answer to respondent's complaint, a claim for damages for injury, and a motion to dissolve the restraining order. Petitioner averred that he was the sole claimant concerning the events of March 17, 1998. He waived any claim of res judicata concerning limited liability based on a state court judgment; he stipulated that respondent &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*442&lt;/span&gt; could relitigate issues relating to the limitation of liability in District Court. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 72. Petitioner later stipulated that the value of his claim was less than the value of the limitation fund, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 102, recanting his earlier allegation that his claim exceeded the vessel's value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Court dissolved the restraining order that prevented petitioner from proceeding with his cause of action in state court. &lt;i&gt;In re Complaint of Lewis &amp;amp; Clark Marine, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/moed/dTYP/in-re-complaint-of-lewis-clark/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1164&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (ED Mo. 1998). The court recognized that federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a vessel owner is entitled to limited liability. The court also noted, however, that the statute that confers exclusive jurisdiction over admiralty and maritime claims to federal courts contains a clause that saves to suitors "all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled." 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1333(1). The court reasoned that "a tension exists between the exclusive jurisdiction vested in the admiralty courts to determine a vessel owner's right to limited liability and the savings to suitors clause." 31 F. Supp. 2d, at 1168.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Court found two exceptions to exclusive federal jurisdiction under which a claimant is allowed to litigate his claim in state court. The first is where the value of the limitation fund exceeds the total value of all claims asserted against the vessel owner. The second is where a single claimant brings an action against the vessel owner seeking damages in excess of the value of the vessel. The court concluded that it should dissolve the injunction in this case because petitioner met the limited fund exception and probably met the single claimant exception as well. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1169, and n. 3. The court decided to retain jurisdiction over the limitation action to protect the vessel owner's right to limitation in the event that the state proceedings necessitated further proceedings in federal court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the District Court abused its discretion in dissolving the injunction. 196 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*443&lt;/span&gt; F. 3d 900 (1999). The Court of Appeals, like the District Court, recognized potential tension between the saving to suitors clause in the jurisdictional statute and the Limitation Act. The Court of Appeals, however, perceived no conflict between those provisions in the instant case. The Court of Appeals explained that a court must consider whether the vessel owner has the right to remain in federal court and whether the claimant is seeking a saved remedy in another forum. The court concluded that respondent had a right to seek exoneration from liability, not merely limitation of liability, in federal court. The court also concluded that because petitioner did not request a trial by jury, he had not sought a saved remedy in state court. The court determined that there was no substantive difference between the remedies afforded petitioner in state court and federal court. For these reasons, the court held that there was no basis for dissolving the injunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We granted certiorari, 530 U. S. 1202 (2000), to resolve a conflict between the Eighth Circuit's decision and the decisions of other Courts of Appeals. Compare 196 F. 3d 900 (CA8 1999), with &lt;i&gt;Kreta Shipping S. A.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Preussag International Steel Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 192 F. 3d 41 (CA2 1999), &lt;i&gt;Beiswenger Enterprises Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Carletta,&lt;/i&gt; 86 F. 3d 1032 (CA11 1996), and &lt;i&gt;Linton&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Great Lakes Dredge &amp;amp; Dock Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 964 F. 2d 1480 (CA5 1992).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article III, &#167; 2, of the United States Constitution vests federal courts with jurisdiction over all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. Section 9 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 codified this grant of exclusive original jurisdiction, but "sav[ed] to suitors, in all cases, the right of a common law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it." Ch. 20, &#167; 9, 1 Stat. 77. In the intervening years, Congress has revised the language of the saving to suitors clause, but &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*444&lt;/span&gt; its substance has remained largely unchanged. See 28 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 41(3) and 371 Third (1940 ed.) ("saving to suitors in all cases the right of a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it"); 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1333(1) (1946 ed., Supp. II) ("saving to the libellant or petitioner in every case any other remedy to which he is otherwise entitled"); Act of May 24, 1949, ch. 139, &#167; 79, 63 Stat. 101 ("saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled"). The jurisdictional statute now states that "[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of . . . any civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, &lt;i&gt;saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.&lt;/i&gt; " 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1333(1) (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the drafters of the Judiciary Act intended in creating the saving to suitors clause is not entirely clear and has been the subject of some debate. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 1 J. Goebel, Antecedents and Beginnings to 1801, History of the Supreme Court of the United States 474 (1971). Compare Casto, The Origins of Federal Admiralty Jurisdiction in an Age of Privateers, Smugglers, and Pirates, 37 Am. J. Legal Hist. 117, 139-149 (1993), with Gutoff, Original Understandings and the Private Law Origins of the Federal Admiralty Jurisdiction, A Reply to Professor Casto, 30 J. Mar. L. &amp;amp; Com. 361, 387-390 (1999). This Court theorized that the saving to suitors clause was "inserted, probably, from abundant caution, lest the exclusive terms in which the power is conferred on the District Courts might be deemed to have taken away the concurrent remedy which had before existed. This leaves the concurrent power where it stood at common law." &lt;i&gt;New Jersey Steam Nav. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Merchants' Bank of Boston,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;How.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;344&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 390 (1848).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early cases we defined the limits of the clause. For instance, proceedings &lt;i&gt;in rem&lt;/i&gt; were deemed outside the scope of the clause because an &lt;i&gt;in rem&lt;/i&gt; action was not a common law remedy, but instead a proceeding under civil law. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*445&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Hine&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Trevor,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/s6J/the-hine-v-trevor/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;555&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 571-572 (1867); &lt;i&gt;The Moses Taylor,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;411&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 431 (1867). We later distinguished between the concept of rights and remedies. &lt;i&gt;Chelentis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Luckenbach S. S. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 247 U. S. 372, 383-384 (1918). In &lt;i&gt;Chelentis,&lt;/i&gt; we held that maritime law governs a seaman's right to recovery against a vessel owner for his injuries aboard the vessel. We explained that "[t]he distinction between rights and remedies is fundamental. A right is a well founded or acknowledged claim; a remedy is the means employed to enforce a right or redress an injury." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 384.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a subsequent case, the Court defined the saving to suitors clause as a grant to state courts of &lt;i&gt;in personam&lt;/i&gt; jurisdiction, concurrent with admiralty courts. &lt;i&gt;Red Cross Line&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Atlantic Fruit Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 264 U. S. 109, 123 (1924). We held enforceable an arbitration agreement between an owner of a steamship and a company that chartered the ship. We reasoned that agreements to arbitrate were valid under admiralty law, and that the State of New York had the power to confer on its courts the authority to compel parties to submit to arbitration. We explained that the state arbitration law merely provided a remedy in state court:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The `right of a common law remedy,' so saved to suitors, does not . . . include attempted changes by the States in the substantive admiralty law, but it does include all means other than proceedings in admiralty which may be employed to enforce the right or to redress the injury involved. It includes remedies &lt;i&gt;in pais,&lt;/i&gt;  as well as proceedings in court; judicial remedies conferred by statute, as well as those existing at the common law; remedies in equity, as well as those enforceable in a court of law." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 123-124.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the saving to suitors clause preserves remedies and the concurrent jurisdiction of state courts over some admiralty and maritime claims. See also &lt;i&gt;Madruga&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Superior&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*446&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Court of Cal., County of San Diego,&lt;/i&gt; 346 U. S. 556, 560-561 (1954); &lt;i&gt;Steamboat Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chase,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/snm/steamboat-co-v-chase/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;522&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 533-534 (1873).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admiralty and maritime law includes a host of special rights, duties, rules, and procedures. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 46 U. S. C. App. &#167; 721 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; (wrecks and salvage); &#167; 741 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; (suits in admiralty by or against vessels or cargoes of the United States); 46 U. S. C. &#167; 10101 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; (merchant seamen protection and relief). Among these provisions is the Limitation Act, 46 U. S. C. App. &#167; 181 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; The Act allows a vessel owner to limit liability for damage or injury, occasioned without the owner's privity or knowledge, to the value of the vessel or the owner's interest in the vessel. The central provision of the Act provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The liability of the owner of any vessel, whether American or foreign, for any embezzlement, loss, or destruction by any person of any property, goods, or merchandise shipped or put on board of such vessel, or for any loss, damage, or injury by collision, or for any act, matter, or thing, loss, damage, or forfeiture, done, occasioned, or incurred, without the privity or knowledge of such owner or owners, shall not, except in the cases provided for in subsection (b) of this section, exceed the amount or value of the interest of such owner in such vessel, and her freight then pending." &#167; 183(a).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See also &#167; 183(b) (requiring supplemental fund for some vessels for personal injury and death claimants).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress passed the Limitation Act in 1851 "to encourage ship-building and to induce capitalists to invest money in this branch of industry." &lt;i&gt;Norwich Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wright,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/shR/norwich-co-v-wright/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;104&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 121 (1872). See also &lt;i&gt;British Transport Comm'n&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 354 U. S. 129, 133-135 (1957); &lt;i&gt;Just&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chambers,&lt;/i&gt; 312 U. S. 383, 385 (1941). The Act also had the purpose of "putting American shipping upon an equality with that of other &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*447&lt;/span&gt; maritime nations" that had their own limitation acts. &lt;i&gt;The Main&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Williams,&lt;/i&gt; 152 U. S. 122, 128 (1894). See also &lt;i&gt;Norwich Co., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 116-119 (discussing history of limitation acts in England, France, and the States that led to the passage of the Limitation Act).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Act is not a model of clarity. See 2 T. Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law 299 (2d ed. 1994) ("Th[e] 1851 Act, badly drafted even by the standards of the time, continues in effect today"). Having created a right to seek limited liability, Congress did not provide procedures for determining the entitlement. This Court did not have an opportunity to review the Act in detail until 20 years after its enactment. See &lt;i&gt;Norwich Co., supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; Deeming the Act "incapable of execution" without further instructions to courts, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 123, we designed the procedures that govern a limitation action, and promulgated them the same Term, see Supplementary Rules of Practice in Admiralty, 13 Wall. xii&#151;xiv. We later explained that the scheme "was sketched in outline" by the Act, and "the regulation of details as to the form and modes of proceeding was left to be prescribed by judicial authority." &lt;i&gt;Providence &amp;amp; New York S. S. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hill Mfg. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 109 U. S. 578, 590 (1883).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1872 rules were "intended to facilitate the proceedings of the owners of vessels for claiming the limitation of liability secured by the statute." &lt;i&gt;The "Benefactor,"&lt;/i&gt; 103 U. S. 239, 244 (1880). Under the rules, a vessel owner seeking limitation of liability had to file a petition. The district court would obtain an appraisal of the vessel's value or the owner's interest in the vessel, and ensure that payment or some guarantee of payment was deposited with the court. The court would then order all claimants to appear. Supplementary Rule of Practice in Admiralty 54, 13 Wall., at xii&#151; xiii. In the process of seeking limited liability, the owner was permitted to contest the fact of liability. Rule 56, 13 Wall., at xiii. The ability to contest liability relieved vessel owners of the "very onerous" English rule, which required &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*448&lt;/span&gt; vessel owners to confess liability in order to seek the benefit of limitation. &lt;i&gt;The "Benefactor," supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 243 ("[T]his court, in preparing the rules of procedure for a limitation of liability, deemed it proper to allow a party seeking such limitation to contest any liability whatever"). The claimants would then contest the vessel owner's claims for exoneration and limitation of liability. Rule 56, 13 Wall., at xiii. If the owner succeeded in its effort to limit liability, but was not exonerated, the court was responsible for distributing the fund deposited in the court among the claimants. Rule 55, 13 Wall., at xiii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure for a limitation action is now found in Supplemental Admiralty and Maritime Claims Rule F. Much like its predecessor provisions, Rule F sets forth the process for filing a complaint seeking exoneration from, or limitation of, liability. The district court secures the value of the vessel or owner's interest, marshals claims, and enjoins the prosecution of other actions with respect to the claims. In these proceedings, the court, sitting without a jury, adjudicates the claims. The court determines whether the vessel owner is liable and whether the owner may limit liability. The court then determines the validity of the claims, and if liability is limited, distributes the limited fund among the claimants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;C&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some tension exists between the saving to suitors clause and the Limitation Act. One statute gives suitors the right to a choice of remedies, and the other statute gives vessel owners the right to seek limitation of liability in federal court. We confronted this tension in &lt;i&gt;Langnes&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Green,&lt;/i&gt; 282 U. S. 531 (1931). The respondent in &lt;i&gt;Langnes&lt;/i&gt; was employed on the petitioner's vessel. The employee sued the vessel owner in state court for $25,000 for personal injuries suffered aboard the vessel. The vessel owner later filed a petition for limitation of liability in Federal District Court. The District Court enjoined any further proceedings in state court &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*449&lt;/span&gt; and issued a notice that all claimants appear. The employee filed his claim in District Court. The parties stipulated that the vessel was worth no more than $5,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The employee sought dissolution of the injunction. He argued that the state court had jurisdiction over his claim, that he was the only possible claimant, that there was only one vessel owner, and therefore the vessel owner could claim the benefit of the Limitation Act by proper pleading in state court. The District Court denied the motion and proceeded to decide the merits, concluding that the vessel owner was not liable. The Court of Appeals reversed on the issue of limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On review, this Court concluded that both courts erred in failing to recognize that the state court was competent to hear the employee's personal injury claim and the vessel owner's claim for limitation. In our view, the choice before the District Court was whether it should retain the limitation action and preserve the right of the vessel owner but destroy the right of the employee in state court to a common law remedy, or allow the action in state court to proceed and preserve the rights of both parties. We concluded that the latter course was just. We decided that the District Court should have dissolved the injunction and allowed the employee to proceed with his claim in state court, and retained jurisdiction over the petition for limitation of liability in the event that the state proceedings necessitated further proceedings in federal court. We explained that the District Court's decision is "one of discretion in every case," and remanded for further proceedings. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 544.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our decision, the employee was permitted to pursue his claim in state court. See &lt;i&gt;Ex parte Green,&lt;/i&gt; 286 U. S. 437 (1932). In those proceedings, notwithstanding this Court's recognition of the vessel owner's right to seek limitation of liability in federal court, the employee sought to litigate that issue in state court. We approved of the District Court's decision to enjoin any further proceedings in state court until &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*450&lt;/span&gt; the employee agreed to withdraw his submission on the issue of limited liability. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 440.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also considered the conflict between the saving to suitors clause and the Limitation Act in a case where several claimants attempted to sue avessel owner in state court. &lt;i&gt;Lake Tankers Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Henn,&lt;/i&gt; 354 U. S. 147 (1957). A pleasure yacht, the &lt;i&gt;Blackstone,&lt;/i&gt; capsized after a collision with a tug that was push-towing a barge, injuring several persons and killing one. Claimants sued the owner of the tug and barge in state court actions. The owner filed a petition for exoneration from, or limitation of, liability in federal court. The owner also filed a bond for the tug in the amount of approximately $119,000 and a bond for the barge in the amount of $165,000. The District Court enjoined other proceedings concerning the collision. Thereafter, the claimants made their demands for damages; the total claims were less than the amount of the two bonds. All claimants relinquished any right to damages in excess of that set forth in their claims. They further waived any claim of res judicata relating to the issue of the vessel owner's ability to limit liability. The District Court decided to dissolve the injunction because the total limitation fund exceeded the amount of the claims. The Court of Appeals affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision. In examining the Limitation Act and its history, we found it "crystal clear that the operation of the Act is directed at misfortunes at sea where the losses incurred exceed the value of the vessel and the pending freight." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 151. Where the value of the vessel and the pending freight exceed the claims, however, there is no necessity for the maintenance of the action in federal court. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 152. The stipulations, in addition to other restrictions on the state court proceedings, ensured "beyond doubt that [the owner's] right of limitation under the Act was fully protected." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; We explained that to expand the scope of exclusive jurisdiction to prevent the state court actions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*451&lt;/span&gt; "would transform the Act from a protective instrument to an offensive weapon by which the shipowner could deprive suitors of their common-law rights, even where the limitation fund is known to be more than adequate to satisfy all demands upon it. The shipowner's right to limit liability is not so boundless. The Act is not one of immunity from liability but of limitation of it and we read no other privilege for the shipowner into its language over and above that granting him limited liability. In fact, the Congress not only created the limitation procedure for the primary purpose of apportioning the limitation fund among the claimants where that fund was inadequate to pay the claims in full, but it reserved to such suitors their common-law remedies." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 152-153.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since these decisions, the Courts of Appeals have generally permitted claimants to proceed with their claims in state court where there is only a single claimant, as in &lt;i&gt;Langnes,&lt;/i&gt;  or where the total claims do not exceed the value of the limitation fund, as in &lt;i&gt;Lake Tankers.&lt;/i&gt; See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beiswenger Enterprises Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Carletta,&lt;/i&gt; 86 F. 3d 1032 (CA11 1996); &lt;i&gt;Linton&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Great Lakes Dredge &amp;amp; Dock Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 964 F. 2d 1480 (CA5 1992). See also &lt;i&gt;Kreta Shipping S. A.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Preussag International Steel Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 192 F. 3d 41 (CA2 1999) (foreign forum).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the instant case, we believe that the District Court properly exercised its discretion in dissolving the injunction that prevented petitioner from pursuing his claims in state court. The District Court, guided by our prior cases, attempted to reconcile petitioner's right to his remedy under the saving to suitors clause with respondent's right to seek limited liability under the Limitation Act. The court dissolved the injunction against the state court proceedings after it concluded that respondent's right to seek limitation of liability would be adequately protected. Respondent's &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*452&lt;/span&gt; rights were protected by petitioner's stipulation that his claim did not exceed the limitation fund, petitioner's waiver of any defense of res judicata with respect to limitation of liability, and the District Court's decision to stay the Limitation Act proceedings pending state court proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eighth Circuit held that the District Court should not have dissolved the injunction without first "finding . . . actual statutory conflict between the Limitation Act and the `saving to suitors' clause in the case at bar." 196 F. 3d, at 906. The Court of Appeals concluded that there was no conflict here because respondent had a right to seek exoneration from liability in federal court, and petitioner did not have a saved remedy under the saving to suitors clause. That reasoning misapprehends this Court's prior decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, there was a conflict between the saving to suitors clause and the Limitation Act. Petitioner sued respondent in state court; under the saving to suitors clause, that court had jurisdiction to hear his claims. Respondent sought limited liability for petitioner's claims in federal court; the Limitation Act granted the federal court jurisdiction over that action. Both parties selected legitimate forums for their claims, and therein lies the conflict. Had petitioner sought to institute &lt;i&gt;in rem&lt;/i&gt; proceedings against respondent in state court, that court would have lacked jurisdiction because the saving to suitors clause does not reach actions &lt;i&gt;in rem.&lt;/i&gt; Similarly, had respondent sought limited liability for payment of wages in federal court, that court would not have had jurisdiction under the Limitation Act because claims for wages due employees are not covered. 46 U. S. C. App. &#167; 189. See also &lt;i&gt;In re East River Towing Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 266 U. S. 355, 367 (1924). Here, however, there appears to have been no obstacle to each party pursuing its claim in the forum of its choice, except the competing action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In deciding that the case should proceed in federal court, the Court of Appeals relied on two flawed premises: that the Limitation Act grants vessel owners a right to obtain &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*453&lt;/span&gt; exoneration from liability in federal court where limitation of liability is not at issue, and that the saving to suitors clause reserves to claimants only the right to receive a jury trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By its own terms, the Limitation Act protects the right of vessel owners to limit their liability to the value of the vessel, provided that the events or circumstances giving rise to the damage occurred without the vessel owner's privity or knowledge. The Act was designed to encourage investment and protect vessel owners from unlimited exposure to liability. We have also made clear, however, that the scope of exclusive federal jurisdiction is proportional to the federal interest in protecting the vessel owner's right to seek limitation of liability. See &lt;i&gt;Lake Tankers,&lt;/i&gt; 354 U. S., at 153. We have explained that "[t]he Act is not one of immunity from liability but of limitation of it." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 152. We see no reason to revisit that conclusion and decline respondent's invitation to expand the scope of the Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In construing the Limitation Act, this Court long ago determined that vessel owners may contest liability in the process of seeking limited liability, and we promulgated rules to that effect pursuant to our "power to regulate . . . proceedings." &lt;i&gt;The "Benefactor,"&lt;/i&gt; 103 U. S., at 244; Supplementary Rule of Practice in Admiralty 56, 13 Wall., at xiii; Supplemental Admiralty and Maritime Claims Rule F(2). Thus, we agree with respondent that a vessel owner need not confess liability in order to seek limitation under the Act. The Act and the rules of practice, however, do not create a freestanding right to exoneration from liability in circumstances where limitation of liability is not at issue. In this case, petitioner stipulated that his claim for damages would not exceed the value of the vessel and waived any claim of res judicata from the state court action concerning issues bearing on the limitation of liability. The District Court concluded that these stipulations would protect the vessel owner's right to seek limited liability in federal court. Then, out of an "abundance of caution," the court stayed the limitation &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*454&lt;/span&gt; proceedings so that it could act if the state court proceedings jeopardized the vessel owner's rights under the Limitation Act. 31 F. Supp. 2d, at 1170-1171. We believe nothing more was required to protect respondent's right to seek a limitation of liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district courts have jurisdiction over actions arising under the Limitation Act, and they have discretion to stay or dismiss Limitation Act proceedings to allow a suitor to pursue his claims in state court. If the district court concludes that the vessel owner's right to limitation will not be adequately protected&#151;where for example a group of claimants cannot agree on appropriate stipulations or there is uncertainty concerning the adequacy of the fund or the number of claims&#151;the court may proceed to adjudicate the merits, deciding the issues of liability and limitation. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lake Tankers, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 152; &lt;i&gt;Port Arthur Towing Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;John W. Towing, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 42 F. 3d 312, 314 (CA5 1995). But where, as here, the District Court satisfies itself that a vessel owner's right to seek limitation will be protected, the decision to dissolve the injunction is well within the court's discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals reasoned that the District Court also erred in dissolving the injunction because petitioner had no saved remedy in state court. The Court of Appeals apparently treated as dispositive petitioner's failure to demand a jury trial in state court. The jurisdictional statute, however, reserves to suitors "all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled." 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1333(1). Tracing the development of the clause since the Judiciary Act of 1789, it appears that the clause was designed to protect remedies available at common law. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Hine&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Trevor,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/s6J/the-hine-v-trevor/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;555&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1867). We later explained that the clause extends to "all means other than proceedings in admiralty which may be employed to enforce the right or to redress the injury involved." &lt;i&gt;Red Cross Line,&lt;/i&gt; 264 U. S., at 124. Trial by jury is an obvious, but not exclusive, example of the remedies &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*455&lt;/span&gt; available to suitors. See &lt;i&gt;Lake Tankers, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 153; &lt;i&gt;Red Cross Line, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 123-125.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals concluded that forum choice could not be a saved remedy under the saving to suitors clause because a claimant does not have the ability to control the forum in which his claim will be heard. 196 F. 3d, at 909. The prospect that a vessel owner may remove a state court action to federal court, however, does not limit a claimant's forum choice under the saving to suitors clause any more than other litigants' forum choices may be limited. We have previously refused to hold that admiralty claims, such as a limitation claim, fall within the scope of federal question jurisdiction out of concern that saving to suitors actions in state court would be removed to federal court and undermine the claimant's choice of forum. &lt;i&gt;Romero&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;International Terminal Operating Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 358 U. S. 354, 371-372 (1959). We explained that to define admiralty jurisdiction as federal question jurisdiction would be a "destructive oversimplification of the highly intricate interplay of the States and the National Government in their regulation of maritime commerce." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 373. Moreover, in this case respondent raised a Jones Act claim, which is not subject to removal to federal court even in the event of diversity of the parties. See 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1445(a) (incorporated by reference into the Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. &#167; 688(a)). Respondent's arguments to limit and enumerate the saved remedies under the saving to suitors clause must fail in view of the consistent recognition by Congress and this Court that both state and federal courts may be proper forums for adjudicating claims such as petitioner's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, this Court's case law makes clear that state courts, with all of their remedies, may adjudicate claims like petitioner's against vessel owners so long as the vessel owner's right to seek limitation of liability is protected. Respondent seeks to invert that rule, making run of the mill personal &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*456&lt;/span&gt; injury actions involving vessels a matter of exclusive federal jurisdiction except where the claimant happens to seek a jury trial. We reject that proposal and hold that the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the District Court's decision to dissolve the injunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE APPELLATE COURT OF ILLINOIS, FOURTH DISTRICT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*328&lt;/span&gt; Breyer, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined. Souter, J., filed a concurring opinion, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 337. Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 338.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joel D. Bertocchi,&lt;/i&gt; Solicitor General of Illinois, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;James E. Ryan,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;William L. Browers&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Colleen M. Griffin,&lt;/i&gt; Assistant Attorneys General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matthew D. Roberts&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Robinson, Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Deborah Watson.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*328&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Deanne Fortna Jones&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With her on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Jeff Justice.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Breyer, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police officers, with probable cause to believe that a man had hidden marijuana in his home, prevented that man from entering the home for about two hours while they obtained a search warrant. We must decide whether those officers violated the Fourth Amendment. We conclude that the officers acted reasonably. They did not violate the Amendment's requirements. And we reverse an Illinois court's holding to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 2, 1997, Tera McArthur asked two police officers to accompany her to the trailer where she lived with her husband, Charles, so that they could keep the peace while she removed her belongings. The two officers, Assistant Chief John Love and Officer Richard Skidis, arrived with &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*329&lt;/span&gt; Tera at the trailer at about 3:15 p.m. Tera went inside, where Charles was present. The officers remained outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Tera emerged after collecting her possessions, she spoke to Chief Love, who was then on the porch. She suggested he check the trailer because "Chuck had dope in there." App. 15. She added (in Love's words) that she had seen Chuck "slid[e] some dope underneath the couch." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love knocked on the trailer door, told Charles what Tera had said, and asked for permission to search the trailer, which Charles denied. Love then sent Officer Skidis with Tera to get a search warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love told Charles, who by this time was also on the porch, that he could not reenter the trailer unless a police officer accompanied him. Charles subsequently reentered the trailer two or three times (to get cigarettes and to make phone calls), and each time Love stood just inside the door to observe what Charles did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officer Skidis obtained the warrant by about 5 p.m. He returned to the trailer and, along with other officers, searched it. The officers found under the sofa a marijuana pipe, a box for marijuana (called a "one-hitter" box), and a small amount of marijuana. They then arrested Charles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illinois subsequently charged Charles McArthur with unlawfully possessing drug paraphernalia and marijuana (less than 2.5 grams), both misdemeanors. See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, &#167;&#167; 550/4(a), 600/3.5(a) (1998). McArthur moved to suppress the pipe, box, and marijuana on the ground that they were the "fruit" of an unlawful police seizure, namely, the refusal to let him reenter the trailer unaccompanied, which would have permitted him, he said, to "have destroyed the marijuana." App. 27.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial court granted McArthur's suppression motion. The Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed, 304 Ill. App. 3d &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*330&lt;/span&gt; 395, 713 N. E. 2d 93 (1999), and the Illinois Supreme Court denied the State's petition for leave to appeal, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;185&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ill. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;651&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 720 N. E. 2d 1101 (1999). We granted certiorari to determine whether the Fourth Amendment prohibits the kind of temporary seizure at issue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fourth Amendment says that the "right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated." U. S. Const., Amdt. 4. Its "central requirement" is one of reasonableness. See &lt;i&gt;Texas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Brown,&lt;/i&gt; 460 U. S. 730, 739 (1983). In order to enforce that requirement, this Court has interpreted the Amendment as establishing rules and presumptions designed to control conduct of law enforcement officers that may significantly intrude upon privacy interests. Sometimes those rules require warrants. We have said, for example, that in "the ordinary case," seizures of personal property are "unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment," without more, "unless . . . accomplished pursuant to a judicial warrant," issued by a neutral magistrate after finding probable cause. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Place,&lt;/i&gt; 462 U. S. 696, 701 (1983).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We nonetheless have made it clear that there are exceptions to the warrant requirement. When faced with special law enforcement needs, diminished expectations of privacy, minimal intrusions, or the like, the Court has found that certain general, or individual, circumstances may render a warrantless search or seizure reasonable. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Labron,&lt;/i&gt; 518 U. S. 938, 940-941 (1996) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; (search of automobile supported by probable cause); &lt;i&gt;Michigan Dept. of State Police&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sitz,&lt;/i&gt; 496 U. S. 444, 455 (1990) (suspicionless stops at drunk driver checkpoint); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Place, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 706 (temporary seizure of luggage based on reasonable suspicion); &lt;i&gt;Michigan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*331&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Summers,&lt;/i&gt; 452 U. S. 692, 702-705 (1981) (temporary detention of suspect without arrest warrant to prevent flight and protect officers while executing search warrant); &lt;i&gt;Terry&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ohio,&lt;/i&gt;  392 U. S. 1, 27 (1968) (temporary stop and limited search for weapons based on reasonable suspicion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the circumstances of the case before us, we cannot say that the warrantless seizure was &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; unreasonable. It involves a plausible claim of specially pressing or urgent law enforcement need, &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; "exigent circumstances." Cf., &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Place, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 701 ("[T]he exigencies of the circumstances" may permit temporary seizure without warrant); &lt;i&gt;Warden, Md. Penitentiary&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hayden,&lt;/i&gt; 387 U. S. 294, 298-299 (1967) (warrantless search for suspect and weapons reasonable where delay posed grave danger); &lt;i&gt;Schmerber&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;California,&lt;/i&gt; 384 U. S. 757, 770-771 (1966) (warrantless blood test for alcohol reasonable where delay would have led to loss of evidence). Moreover, the restraint at issue was tailored to that need, being limited in time and scope, cf. &lt;i&gt;Terry&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ohio, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 29-30, and avoiding significant intrusion into the home itself, cf. &lt;i&gt;Payton&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York,&lt;/i&gt; 445 U. S. 573, 585 (1980) ("`[T]he chief evil against which the . . . Fourth Amendment is directed' " is warrantless entry and search of home) (quoting &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States Dist. Court for Eastern Dist. of Mich.,&lt;/i&gt; 407 U. S. 297, 313 (1972)). Consequently, rather than employing a &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt;  rule of unreasonableness, we balance the privacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns to determine if the intrusion was reasonable. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Delaware&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Prouse,&lt;/i&gt; 440 U. S. 648, 654 (1979) (determining lawfulness by balancing privacy and law enforcement interests); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;BrignoniPonce,&lt;/i&gt; 422 U. S. 873, 878 (1975) (same).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that the restriction at issue was reasonable, and hence lawful, in light of the following circumstances, which we consider in combination. First, the police had probable cause to believe that McArthur's trailer home contained evidence of a crime and contraband, namely, unlawful &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*332&lt;/span&gt; drugs. The police had had an opportunity to speak with Tera McArthur and make at least a very rough assessment of her reliability. They knew she had had a firsthand opportunity to observe her husband's behavior, in particular with respect to the drugs at issue. And they thought, with good reason, that her report to them reflected that opportunity. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Upton,&lt;/i&gt; 466 U. S. 727, 732-734 (1984) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; (upholding search warrant issued in similar circumstances).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the police had good reason to fear that, unless restrained, McArthur would destroy the drugs before they could return with a warrant. They reasonably might have thought that McArthur realized that his wife knew about his marijuana stash; observed that she was angry or frightened enough to ask the police to accompany her; saw that after leaving the trailer she had spoken with the police; and noticed that she had walked off with one policeman while leaving the other outside to observe the trailer. They reasonably could have concluded that McArthur, consequently suspecting an imminent search, would, if given the chance, get rid of the drugs fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, the police made reasonable efforts to reconcile their law enforcement needs with the demands of personal privacy. They neither searched the trailer nor arrested McArthur before obtaining a warrant. Rather, they imposed a significantly less restrictive restraint, preventing McArthur only from entering the trailer unaccompanied. They left his home and his belongings intact&#151;until a neutral Magistrate, finding probable cause, issued a warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the police imposed the restraint for a limited period of time, namely, two hours. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Terry&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ohio, supra,&lt;/i&gt;  at 28 (manner in which police act is "vital . .. part of . . . inquiry"). As far as the record reveals, this time period was no longer than reasonably necessary for the police, acting with diligence, to obtain the warrant. Compare &lt;i&gt;United&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*333&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Place,&lt;/i&gt; 462 U. S., at 709-710 (holding 90-minute detention of luggage unreasonable based on nature of interference with person's travels and lack of diligence of police), with &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Van Leeuwen,&lt;/i&gt; 397 U. S. 249, 253 (1970) (holding 29-hour detention of mailed package reasonable given unavoidable delay in obtaining warrant and minimal nature of intrusion). Given the nature of the intrusion and the law enforcement interest at stake, this brief seizure of the premises was permissible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our conclusion that the restriction was lawful finds significant support in this Court's case law. In &lt;i&gt;Segura&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 468 U. S. 796 (1984), the Court considered the admissibility of drugs which the police had found in a lawful, warrant-based search of an apartment, but only after unlawfully entering the apartment and occupying it for 19 hours. The majority held that the drugs were admissible because, had the police acted lawfully throughout, they could have discovered and seized the drugs pursuant to the validly issued warrant. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 799, 814-815 (citing &lt;i&gt;Silverthorne Lumber Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 251 U. S. 385 (1920)). The minority disagreed. However, when describing alternative lawful search and seizure methods, both majority and minority assumed, at least for argument's sake, that the police, armed with reliable information that the apartment contained drugs, might lawfully have sealed the apartment from the outside, restricting entry into the apartment while waiting for the warrant. Compare &lt;i&gt;Segura&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 468 U. S., at 814 ("Had police never entered the apartment, but instead conducted a perimeter stake out to prevent anyone from entering . . . and destroying evidence, the contraband . . .would have been . . .seized precisely as it was here"), with &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 824, n. 15 (Stevens, J., dissenting) ("I assume impoundment would be permissible &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*334&lt;/span&gt; even absent exigent circumstances when it occurs `from the outside'&#151;when the authorities merely seal off premises pending the issuance of a warrant but do not enter"); see also &lt;i&gt;Mincey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arizona,&lt;/i&gt; 437 U. S. 385, 394 (1978) (exigent circumstances do not justify search where police guard at door could prevent loss of evidence); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jeffers,&lt;/i&gt;  342 U. S. 48, 52 (1951) (same).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In various other circumstances, this Court has upheld temporary restraints where needed to preserve evidence until police could obtain a warrant. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Place, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 706 (reasonable suspicion justifies brief detention of luggage pending further investigation); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Van Leeuwen, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 253 (reasonable suspicion justifies detaining package delivered for mailing). Cf. &lt;i&gt;Richards&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin,&lt;/i&gt; 520 U. S. 385, 395 (1997) (no need to "knock and announce" when executing a search warrant where officers reasonably suspect that evidence might be destroyed); &lt;i&gt;Carroll&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 267 U. S. 132, 153 (1925) (warrantless search of automobile constitutionally permissible).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have found no case in which this Court has held unlawful a temporary seizure that was supported by probable cause and was designed to prevent the loss of evidence while the police diligently obtained a warrant in a reasonable period of time. But cf. &lt;i&gt;Welsh&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin,&lt;/i&gt; 466 U. S. 740, 754 (1984) (holding warrantless entry into and arrest in home unreasonable despite possibility that evidence of noncriminal offense would be lost while warrant was being obtained).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;C&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor are we persuaded by the countervailing considerations that the parties or lower courts have raised. McArthur argues that the police proceeded without probable cause. But McArthur has waived this argument. See 304 Ill. App. 3d, at 397, 713 N. E. 2d, at 95 (stating that McArthur &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*335&lt;/span&gt; does not contest existence of probable cause); Brief in Opposition 7 (acknowledging probable cause). And, in any event, it is without merit. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 331-332.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Appellate Court of Illinois concluded that the police could not order McArthur to stay outside his home because McArthur's porch, where he stood at the time, was part of his home; hence the order "amounted to a constructive eviction" of McArthur from his residence. 304 Ill. App. 3d, at 402, 713 N. E. 2d, at 98. This Court has held, however, that a person standing in the doorway of a house is "in a `public' place," and hence subject to arrest without a warrant permitting entry of the home. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Santana,&lt;/i&gt;  427 U. S. 38, 42 (1976). Regardless, we do not believe the difference to which the Appellate Court points&#151;porch versus, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; front walk&#151;could make a significant difference here as to the reasonableness of the police restraint; and that, from the Fourth Amendment's perspective, is what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Appellate Court also found negatively significant the fact that Chief Love, with McArthur's consent, stepped inside the trailer's doorway to observe McArthur when McArthur reentered the trailer on two or three occasions. 304 Ill. App. 3d, at 402-403, 713 N. E. 2d, at 98. McArthur, however, reentered simply for his own convenience, to make phone calls and to obtain cigarettes. Under these circumstances, the reasonableness of the greater restriction (preventing reentry) implies the reasonableness of the lesser (permitting reentry conditioned on observation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, McArthur points to a case (and we believe it is the only case) that he believes offers direct support, namely, &lt;i&gt;Welsh&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Welsh,&lt;/i&gt; this Court held that police could not enter a home without a warrant in order to prevent the loss of evidence (namely, the defendant's blood alcohol level) of the "nonjailable traffic offense" of driving while intoxicated. 466 U. S., at 742, 754. McArthur notes &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*336&lt;/span&gt; that his two convictions are for misdemeanors, which, he says, are as minor, and he adds that the restraint, keeping him out of his home, was nearly as serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We nonetheless find significant distinctions. The evidence at issue here was of crimes that were "jailable," not "nonjailable." See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, &#167; 550/4(a) (1998); ch. 730, &#167; 5/5-8&#151;3(3) (possession of less than 2.5 grams of marijuana punishable by up to 30 days in jail); ch. 720, &#167; 600/ 3.5; ch. 730, &#167; 5/5-8&#151;3(1) (possession of drug paraphernalia punishable by up to one year in jail). In &lt;i&gt;Welsh,&lt;/i&gt; we noted that, "[g]iven that the classification of state crimes differs widely among the States, the penalty that may attach to any particular offense seems to provide the clearest and most consistent indication of the State's interest in arresting individuals suspected of committing that offense." 466 U. S., at 754, n. 14. The same reasoning applies here, where class C misdemeanors include such widely diverse offenses as drag racing, drinking alcohol in a railroad car or on a railroad platform, bribery by a candidate for public office, and assault. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 65, &#167; 5/4-8&#151;2 (1998); ch. 610, &#167; 90/1; ch. 625, &#167; 5/11-504; ch. 720, &#167; 5/12-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the restriction at issue here is less serious. Temporarily keeping a person from entering his home, a consequence whenever police stop a person on the street, is considerably less intrusive than police entry into the home itself in order to make a warrantless arrest or conduct a search. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Payton&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York,&lt;/i&gt; 445 U. S., at 585 (the Fourth Amendment's central concern is the warrantless entry and search of the home).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have explained above why we believe that the need to preserve evidence of a "jailable" offense was sufficiently urgent or pressing to justify the restriction upon entry that the police imposed. We need not decide whether the circumstances before us would have justified a greater restriction for this type of offense or the same restriction were only a "nonjailable" offense at issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*337&lt;/span&gt; III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, the police officers in this case had probable cause to believe that a home contained contraband, which was evidence of a crime. They reasonably believed that the home's resident, if left free of any restraint, would destroy that evidence. And they imposed a restraint that was both limited and tailored reasonably to secure law enforcement needs while protecting privacy interests. In our view, the restraint met the Fourth Amendment's demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Illinois Appellate Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Souter, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I join the Court's opinion subject to this afterword on two points: the constitutionality of a greater intrusion than the one here and the permissibility of choosing impoundment over immediate search. Respondent McArthur's location made the difference between the exigency that justified temporarily barring him from his own dwelling and circumstances that would have supported a greater interference with his privacy and property. As long as he was inside his trailer, the police had probable cause to believe that he had illegal drugs stashed as his wife had reported and that with any sense he would flush them down the drain before the police could get a warrant to enter and search. This probability of destruction in anticipation of a warrant exemplifies the kind of present risk that undergirds the accepted exigent circumstances exception to the general warrant requirement. &lt;i&gt;Schmerber&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;California,&lt;/i&gt; 384 U. S. 757, 770-771 (1966). That risk would have justified the police in entering McArthur's trailer promptly to make a lawful, warrantless search. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Santana,&lt;/i&gt; 427 U. S. 38, 42-43 (1976); &lt;i&gt;Warden, Md. Penitentiary&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hayden,&lt;/i&gt;  387 U. S. 294, 298-299 (1967). When McArthur stepped &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*338&lt;/span&gt; outside and left the trailer uninhabited, the risk abated and so did the reasonableness of entry by the police for as long as he was outside. This is so because the only justification claimed for warrantless action here is the immediate risk, and the limit of reasonable response by the police is set by the scope of the risk. See &lt;i&gt;Terry&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ohio,&lt;/i&gt; 392 U. S. 1, 25-26 (1968).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since, however, McArthur wished to go back in, why was it reasonable to keep him out when the police could perfectly well have let him do as he chose, and then enjoyed the ensuing opportunity to follow him and make a warrantless search justified by the renewed danger of destruction? The answer is not that the law officiously insists on safeguarding a suspect's privacy from search, in preference to respecting the suspect's liberty to enter his own dwelling. Instead, the legitimacy of the decision to impound the dwelling follows from the law's strong preference for warrants, which underlies the rule that a search with a warrant has a stronger claim to justification on later, judicial review than a search without one. See &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v&lt;i&gt;. Ventresca,&lt;/i&gt; 380 U. S. 102, 106 (1965); see also 5 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure &#167; 11.2(b), p. 38 (3d ed. 1996) ("[M]ost states follow the rule which is utilized in the federal courts: if the search or seizure was pursuant to a warrant, the defendant has the burden of proof; but if the police acted without a warrant the burden of proof is on the prosecution"). The law can hardly raise incentives to obtain a warrant without giving the police a fair chance to take their probable cause to a magistrate and get one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Illinois General Assembly has decided that the possession of less than 2.5 grams of marijuana is a class C misdemeanor. See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, &#167; 550/4(a) (1998). In so classifying the offense, the legislature made a concerted policy judgment that the possession of small amounts of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*339&lt;/span&gt; marijuana for personal use does not constitute a particularly significant public policy concern. While it is true that this offense&#151;like feeding livestock on a public highway or offering a movie for rent without clearly displaying its rating&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&#151; may warrant a jail sentence of up to 30 days, the detection and prosecution of possessors of small quantities of this substance is by no means a law enforcement priority in the State of Illinois.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the governmental interest implicated by the particular criminal prohibition at issue in this case is so slight, this is a poor vehicle for probing the boundaries of the government's power to limit an individual's possessory interest in his or her home pending the arrival of a search warrant. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Segura&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 468 U. S. 796 (1984) (seven Justices decline to address this issue because case does not require its resolution). Given my preference, I would, therefore, dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compelled by the vote of my colleagues to reach the merits, I would affirm. As the majority explains, the essential inquiry in this case involves a balancing of the "privacyrelated &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*340&lt;/span&gt; and law enforcement-related concerns to determine if the intrusion was reasonable." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 331. Under the specific facts of this case, I believe the majority gets the balance wrong. Each of the Illinois jurists who participated in the decision of this case placed a higher value on the sanctity of the ordinary citizen's home than on the prosecution of this petty offense. They correctly viewed that interest&#151;whether the home be a humble cottage, a secondhand trailer, or a stately mansion&#151;as one meriting the most serious constitutional protection.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Following their analysis and the reasoning in our decision in &lt;i&gt;Welsh&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin,&lt;/i&gt; 466 U. S. 740 (1984) (holding that some offenses may be so minor as to make it unreasonable for police to undertake searches that would be constitutionally permissible if graver offenses were suspected), I would affirm.&lt;/p&gt;

Other examples of offenses classified as class C misdemeanors in Illinois include camping on the side of a public highway, ch. 605, &#167; 5/9-124, interfering with the "lawful taking of wild animals," ch. 720, &#167; 125/2, and tattooing the body of a person under 21 years of age, ch. 720, &#167; 5/12-10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Nor in many other States. Under the laws of many other States, the maximum penalty McArthur would have faced for possession of 2.3 grams of marijuana would have been less than what he faced in Illinois.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*289&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*290&lt;/span&gt; Souter, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Stevens, O'Connor, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deputy Solicitor General Underwood&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal. With her on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Acting Assistant Attorney General Lee, Irving L. Gornstein, Dennis J. Dimsey,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gregory B. Friel.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Richard L. Colbert&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for respondents.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Souter, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is whether a state wide association incorporated to regulate interscholastic athletic competition among public and private secondary schools may be regarded as engaging in state action when it enforces a rule against a member school. The association in question here includes most public schools located within the State, acts through their representatives, draws its officers from them, is largely funded &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*291&lt;/span&gt; by their dues and income received in their stead, and has historically been seen to regulate in lieu of the State Board of Education's exercise of its own authority. We hold that the association's regulatory activity may and should be treated as state action owing to the pervasive entwinement of state school officials in the structure of the association, there being no offsetting reason to see the association's acts in any other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association (Association) is a not-for-profit membership corporation organized to regulate interscholastic sport among the public and private high schools in Tennessee that belong to it. No school is forced to join, but without any other authority actually regulating interscholastic athletics, it enjoys the memberships of almost all the State's public high schools (some 290 of them or 84% of the Association's voting membership), far outnumbering the 55 private schools that belong. A member school's team may play or scrimmage only against the team of another member, absent a dispensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Association's rulemaking arm is its legislative council, while its board of control tends to administration. The voting membership of each of these nine-person committees is limited under the Association's bylaws to high school principals, assistant principals, and superintendents elected by the member schools, and the public school administrators who so serve typically attend meetings during regular school hours. Although the Association's staff members are not paid by the State, they are eligible to join the State's public retirement system for its employees. Member schools pay dues to the Association, though the bulk of its revenue is gate receipts at member teams' football and basketball tournaments, many of them held in public arenas rented by the Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constitution, bylaws, and rules of the Association set standards of school membership and the eligibility of students to play in interscholastic games. Each school, for &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*292&lt;/span&gt; example, is regulated in awarding financial aid, most coaches must have a Tennessee state teaching license, and players must meet minimum academic standards and hew to limits on student employment. Under the bylaws, "in all matters pertaining to the athletic relations of his school," App. 138, the principal is responsible to the Association, which has the power "to suspend, to fine, or otherwise penalize any member school for the violation of any of the rules of the Association or for other just cause," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since the Association was incorporated in 1925, Tennessee's State Board of Education (State Board) has (to use its own words) acknowledged the corporation's functions "in providing standards, rules and regulations for interscholastic competition in the public schools of Tennessee," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 211. More recently, the State Board cited its statutory authority, Tenn. Code Ann. &#167; 49-1&#151;302 (1996) (App. 220), when it adopted language expressing the relationship between the Association and the State Board. Specifically, in 1972, it went so far as to adopt a rule expressly "designat[ing]" the Association as "the organization to supervise and regulate the athletic activities in which the public junior and senior high schools in Tennessee participate on an interscholastic basis." Tennessee State Board of Education, Administrative Rules and Regulations, Rule 0520-1&#151;2&#151;.26 (1972) (later moved to Rule 0520-1&#151;2&#151;.08). The Rule provided that "the authority granted herein shall remain in effect until revoked" and instructed the State Board's chairman to "designate a person or persons to serve in an ex-officio capacity on the [Association's governing bodies]." App. 211. That same year, the State Board specifically approved the Association's rules and regulations, while reserving the right to review future changes. Thus, on several occasions over the next 20 years, the State Board reviewed, approved, or reaffirmed its approval of the recruiting Rule at issue in this case. In 1996, however, the State Board dropped the original Rule 0520-1&#151;2&#151;.08 expressly designating the Association &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*293&lt;/span&gt; as regulator; it substituted a statement "recogniz[ing] the value of participation in interscholastic athletics and the role of [the Association] in coordinating interscholastic athletic competition," while "authoriz[ing] the public schools of the state to voluntarily maintain membership in [the Association]." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 220.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action before us responds to a 1997 regulatory enforcement proceeding brought against petitioner, Brentwood Academy, a private parochial high school member of the Association. The Association's board of control found that Brentwood violated a rule prohibiting "undue influence" in recruiting athletes, when it wrote to incoming students and their parents about spring football practice. The Association accordingly placed Brentwood's athletic program on probation for four years, declared its football and boys' basketball teams ineligible to compete in play-offs for two years, and imposed a $3,000 fine. When these penalties were imposed, all the voting members of the board of control and legislative council were public school administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brentwood sued the Association and its executive director in federal court under Rev. Stat. &#167; 1979, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1983, claiming that enforcement of the Rule was state action and a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court entered summary judgment for Brentwood and enjoined the Association from enforcing the Rule. &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/tnmd/cRby/brentwood-academy-v-tennessee-secondary-schools/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;670&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (MD Tenn. 1998). In holding the Association to be a state actor under &#167; 1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment, the District Court found that the State had delegated authority over high school athletics to the Association, characterized the relationship between the Association and its public school members as symbiotic, and emphasized the predominantly public character of the Association's membership and leadership. The court relied on language in &lt;i&gt;National Collegiate Athletic Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tarkanian,&lt;/i&gt; 488 U. S. 179, 193, n. 13 (1988), suggesting that state wide interscholastic athletic associations are state actors, and on other federal cases &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*294&lt;/span&gt; in which such organizations had uniformly been held to be acting under color of state law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. 180 F. 3d 758 (1999). It recognized that there is no single test to identify state actions and state actors but applied three criteria derived from &lt;i&gt;Blum&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Yaretsky,&lt;/i&gt; 457 U. S. 991 (1982), &lt;i&gt;Lugar&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Edmondson Oil Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 457 U. S. 922 (1982), and &lt;i&gt;Rendell-Baker&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kohn,&lt;/i&gt; 457 U. S. 830 (1982), and found no state action under any of them. It said the District Court was mistaken in seeing a symbiotic relationship between the State and the Association, it emphasized that the Association was neither engaging in a traditional and exclusive public function nor responding to state compulsion, and it gave short shrift to the language from &lt;i&gt;Tarkanian&lt;/i&gt; on which the District Court relied. Rehearing en banc was later denied over the dissent of two judges, who criticized the panel decision for creating a conflict among state and federal courts, for being inconsistent with &lt;i&gt;Tarkanian,&lt;/i&gt; and for lacking support in the "functional" analysis of private activity required by &lt;i&gt;West&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Atkins,&lt;/i&gt; 487 U. S. 42 (1988), for assessing the significance of cooperation between public officials and a private actor. 190 F. 3d 705 (CA6 1999) (Merritt, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We granted certiorari, 528 U. S. 1153 (2000), to resolve the conflict&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; and now reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*295&lt;/span&gt; II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our cases try to plot a line between state action subject to Fourteenth Amendment scrutiny and private conduct (however exceptionable) that is not. &lt;i&gt;Tarkanian, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 191; &lt;i&gt;Jackson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Metropolitan Edison Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 419 U. S. 345, 349 (1974). The judicial obligation is not only to "`preserv[e] an area of individual freedom by limiting the reach of federal law' and avoi[d] the imposition of responsibility on a State for conduct it could not control," &lt;i&gt;Tarkanian, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 191 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Lugar, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 936-937), but also to assure that constitutional standards are invoked "when it can be said that the State is &lt;i&gt;responsible&lt;/i&gt; for the specific conduct of which the plaintiff complains," &lt;i&gt;Blum, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 1004 (emphasis in original). If the Fourteenth Amendment is not to be displaced, therefore, its ambit cannot be a simple line between States and people operating outside formally governmental organizations, and the deed of an ostensibly private organization or individual is to be treated sometimes as if a State had caused it to be performed. Thus, we say that state action may be found if, though only if, there is such a "close nexus between the State and the challenged action" that seemingly private behavior "may be fairly treated as that of the State itself." &lt;i&gt;Jackson, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 351.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is fairly attributable is a matter of normative judgment, and the criteria lack rigid simplicity. From the range of circumstances that could point toward the State behind an individual face, no one fact can function as a necessary condition across the board for finding state action; nor is any set of circumstances absolutely sufficient, for there may be some &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*296&lt;/span&gt; countervailing reason against attributing activity to the government. See &lt;i&gt;Tarkanian,&lt;/i&gt; 488 U. S., at 193, 196; &lt;i&gt;Polk County&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dodson,&lt;/i&gt; 454 U. S. 312 (1981).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our cases have identified a host of facts that can bear on the fairness of such an attribution. We have, for example, held that a challenged activity may be state action when it results from the State's exercise of "coercive power," &lt;i&gt;Blum,&lt;/i&gt;  457 U. S., at 1004, when the State provides "significant encouragement, either overt or covert," &lt;i&gt;ibid.,&lt;/i&gt; or when a private actor operates as a "willful participant in joint activity with the State or its agents," &lt;i&gt;Lugar, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 941 (internal quotation marks omitted). We have treated a nominally private entity as a state actor when it is controlled by an "agency of the State," &lt;i&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Board of Directors of City Trusts of Philadelphia,&lt;/i&gt; 353 U. S. 230, 231 (1957) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; when it has been delegated a public function by the State, cf., &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;West&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Atkins, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 56; &lt;i&gt;Edmonson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Leesville Concrete Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 500 U. S. 614, 627-628 (1991), when it is "entwined with governmental policies," or when government is "entwined in [its] management or control," &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Newton,&lt;/i&gt; 382 U. S. 296, 299, 301 (1966).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amidst such variety, examples may be the best teachers, and examples from our cases are unequivocal in showing that the character of a legal entity is determined neither by its expressly private characterization in statutory law, nor by the failure of the law to acknowledge the entity's inseparability from recognized government officials or agencies. &lt;i&gt;Lebron&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;National Railroad Passenger Corporation,&lt;/i&gt; 513 U. S. 374 (1995), held that Amtrak was the Government for constitutional purposes, regardless of its congressional designation as private; it was organized under federal law to attain governmental objectives and was directed and controlled by federal appointees. &lt;i&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Board of Directors of City Trusts of Philadelphia, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; held the privately endowed Girard College to be a state actor and enforcement of its private founder's limitation of admission &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*297&lt;/span&gt; to whites attributable to the State, because, consistent with the terms of the settlor's gift, the college's board of directors was a state agency established by state law. Ostensibly the converse situation occurred in &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Newton, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt;  which held that private trustees to whom a city had transferred a park were nonetheless state actors barred from enforcing racial segregation, since the park served the public purpose of providing community recreation, and "the municipality remain[ed] entwined in [its] management [and] control," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 301.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples of public entwinement in the management and control of ostensibly separate trusts or corporations foreshadow this case, as this Court itself anticipated in &lt;i&gt;Tarkanian. Tarkanian&lt;/i&gt; arose when an undoubtedly state actor, the University of Nevada, suspended its basketball coach, Tarkanian, in order to comply with rules and recommendations of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The coach charged the NCAA with state action, arguing that the state university had delegated its own functions to the NCAA, clothing the latter with authority to make and apply the university's rules, the result being joint action making the NCAA a state actor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, it is not the strict holding in &lt;i&gt;Tarkanian&lt;/i&gt; that points to our view of this case, for we found no state action on the part of the NCAA. We could see, on the one hand, that the university had some part in setting the NCAA's rules, and the Supreme Court of Nevada had gone so far as to hold that the NCAA had been delegated the university's traditionally exclusive public authority over personnel. 488 U. S., at 190. But on the other side, the NCAA's policies were shaped not by the University of Nevada alone, but by several hundred member institutions, most of them having no connection with Nevada, and exhibiting no color of Nevada law. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 193. Since it was difficult to see the NCAA, not as a collective membership, but as surrogate for the one State, we held the organization's connection with Nevada &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*298&lt;/span&gt; too insubstantial to ground a state-action claim. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 193, 196.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But dictum in &lt;i&gt;Tarkanian&lt;/i&gt; pointed to a contrary result on facts like ours, with an organization whose member public schools are all within a single State. "The situation would, of course, be different if the [Association's] membership consisted entirely of institutions located within the same State, many of them public institutions created by the same sovereign." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 193, n. 13. To support our surmise, we approvingly cited two cases: &lt;i&gt;Clark&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arizona Interscholastic Assn.,&lt;/i&gt; 695 F. 2d 1126 (CA9 1982), cert. denied, 464 U. S. 818 (1983), a challenge to a state high school athletic association that kept boys from playing on girls' interscholastic volleyball teams in Arizona; and &lt;i&gt;Louisiana High School Athletic Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;St. Augustine High School,&lt;/i&gt; 396 F. 2d 224 (CA5 1968), a parochial school's attack on the racially segregated system of interscholastic high school athletics maintained by the athletic association. In each instance, the Court of Appeals treated the athletic association as a state actor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as we foresaw in &lt;i&gt;Tarkanian,&lt;/i&gt; the "necessarily factbound inquiry," &lt;i&gt;Lugar,&lt;/i&gt; 457 U. S., at 939, leads to the conclusion of state action here. The nominally private character of the Association is overborne by the pervasive entwinement of public institutions and public officials in its composition and workings, and there is no substantial reason to claim unfairness in applying constitutional standards to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Association is not an organization of natural persons acting on their own, but of schools, and of public schools to the extent of 84% of the total. Under the Association's bylaws, each member school is represented by its principal or a faculty member, who has a vote in selecting members of the governing legislative council and board of control from eligible principals, assistant principals, and superintendents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*299&lt;/span&gt; Although the findings and prior opinions in this case include no express conclusion of law that public school officials act within the scope of their duties when they represent their institutions, no other view would be rational, the official nature of their involvement being shown in any number of ways. Interscholastic athletics obviously play an integral part in the public education of Tennessee, where nearly every public high school spends money on competitions among schools. Since a pickup system of interscholastic games would not do, these public teams need some mechanism to produce rules and regulate competition. The mechanism is an organization overwhelmingly composed of public school officials who select representatives (all of them public officials at the time in question here), who in turn adopt and enforce the rules that make the system work. Thus, by giving these jobs to the Association, the 290 public schools of Tennessee belonging to it can sensibly be seen as exercising their own authority to meet their own responsibilities. Unsurprisingly, then, the record indicates that half the council or board meetings documented here were held during official school hours, and that public schools have largely provided for the Association's financial support. A small portion of the Association's revenue comes from membership dues paid by the schools, and the principal part from gate receipts at tournaments among the member schools. Unlike mere public buyers of contract services, whose payments for services rendered do not convert the service providers into public actors, see &lt;i&gt;Rendell-Baker,&lt;/i&gt; 457 U. S., at 839-843, the schools here obtain membership in the service organization and give up sources of their own income to their collective association. The Association thus exercises the authority of the predominantly public schools to charge for admission to their games; the Association does not receive this money from the schools, but enjoys the schools' moneymaking capacity as its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, to the extent of 84% of its membership, the Association is an organization of public schools represented by their &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*300&lt;/span&gt; officials acting in their official capacity to provide an integral element of secondary public schooling. There would be no recognizable Association, legal or tangible, without the public school officials, who do not merely control but overwhelmingly perform all but the purely ministerial acts by which the Association exists and functions in practical terms. Only the 16% minority of private school memberships prevents this entwinement of the Association and the public school system from being total and their identities totally indistinguishable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complement the entwinement of public school officials with the Association from the bottom up, the State of Tennessee has provided for entwinement from top down. State Board members are assigned ex officio to serve as members of the board of control and legislative council, and the Association's ministerial employees are treated as state employees to the extent of being eligible for membership in the state retirement system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, of course, true that the time is long past when the close relationship between the surrogate association and its public members and public officials acting as such was attested frankly. As mentioned, the terms of the State Board's Rule expressly designating the Association as regulator of interscholastic athletics in public schools were deleted in 1996, the year after a Federal District Court held that the Association was a state actor because its rules were "caused, directed and controlled by the Tennessee Board of Education," &lt;i&gt;Graham&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;TSSAA,&lt;/i&gt; No. 1:95&#151;CV-044, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;1995&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;WL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;115890&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, *5 (ED Tenn., Feb. 20, 1995).&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*301&lt;/span&gt; But the removal of the designation language from Rule 0520-1&#151;2&#151;.08 affected nothing but words. Today the State Board's member-designees continue to sit on the Association's committees as nonvoting members, and the State continues to welcome Association employees in its retirement scheme. The close relationship is confirmed by the Association's enforcement of the same preamendment rules and regulations reviewed and approved by the State Board (including the recruiting Rule challenged by Brentwood), and by the State Board's continued willingness to allow students to satisfy its physical education requirement by taking part in interscholastic athletics sponsored by the Association. The most one can say on the evidence is that the State Board once freely acknowledged the Association's official character but now does it by winks and nods.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; The amendment to the Rule in 1996 affected candor but not the "momentum" of the Association's prior involvement with the State Board. &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Newton,&lt;/i&gt; 382 U. S., at 301. The District Court spoke to this point in finding that because of "custom and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*302&lt;/span&gt; practice," "the conduct of the parties has not materially changed" since 1996, "the connections between TSSAA and the State [being] still pervasive and entwined." 13 F. Supp. 2d, at 681.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entwinement down from the State Board is therefore unmistakable, just as the entwinement up from the member public schools is overwhelming. Entwinement will support a conclusion that an ostensibly private organization ought to be charged with a public character and judged by constitutional standards; entwinement to the degree shown here requires it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;C&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entwinement is also the answer to the Association's several arguments offered to persuade us that the facts would not support a finding of state action under various criteria applied in other cases. These arguments are beside the point, simply because the facts justify a conclusion of state action under the criterion of entwinement, a conclusion in no sense unsettled merely because other criteria of state action may not be satisfied by the same facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Association places great stress, for example, on the application of a public function test, as exemplified in &lt;i&gt;Rendell-Baker&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kohn,&lt;/i&gt; 457 U. S. 830 (1982). There, an apparently private school provided education for students whose special needs made it difficult for them to finish high school. The record, however, failed to show any tradition of providing public special education to students unable to cope with a regular school, who had historically been cared for (or ignored) according to private choice. It was true that various public school districts had adopted the practice of referring students to the school and paying their tuition, and no one disputed that providing the instruction aimed at a proper public objective and conferred a public benefit. But we held that the performance of such a public function did not permit a finding of state action on the part of the school unless the function performed was exclusively and traditionally &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*303&lt;/span&gt; public, as it was not in that case. The Association argues that application of the public function criterion would produce the same result here, and we will assume, &lt;i&gt;arguendo,&lt;/i&gt;  that it would. But this case does not turn on a public function test, any more than &lt;i&gt;Rendell-Baker&lt;/i&gt; had anything to do with entwinement of public officials in the special school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the same reason, it avails the Association nothing to stress that the State neither coerced nor encouraged the actions complained of. "Coercion" and "encouragement" are like "entwinement" in referring to kinds of facts that can justify characterizing an ostensibly private action as public instead. Facts that address any of these criteria are significant, but no one criterion must necessarily be applied. When, therefore, the relevant facts show pervasive entwinement to the point of largely overlapping identity, the implication of state action is not affected by pointing out that the facts might not loom large under a different test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that all of the Association's arguments are rendered beside the point by the public officials' involvement in the Association, for after application of the entwinement criterion, or any other, there is a further potential issue, and the Association raises it. Even facts that suffice to show public action (or, standing alone, would require such a finding) may be outweighed in the name of some value at odds with finding public accountability in the circumstances. In &lt;i&gt;Polk County,&lt;/i&gt; 454 U. S., at 322, a defense lawyer's actions were deemed private even though she was employed by the county and was acting within the scope of her duty as a public defender. Full-time public employment would be conclusive of state action for some purposes, see &lt;i&gt;West&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Atkins,&lt;/i&gt;  487 U. S., at 50, accord, &lt;i&gt;Lugar,&lt;/i&gt; 457 U. S., at 935, n. 18, but not when the employee is doing a defense lawyer's primary job; then, the public defender does "not ac[t] on behalf of the State; he is the State's adversary." &lt;i&gt;Polk County, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*304&lt;/span&gt; 323, n. 13. The state-action doctrine does not convert opponents into virtual agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assertion of such a countervailing value is the nub of each of the Association's two remaining arguments, neither of which, however, persuades us. The Association suggests, first, that reversing the judgment here will somehow trigger an epidemic of unprecedented federal litigation. Brief for Respondents 35. Even if that might be counted as a good reason for a &lt;i&gt;Polk County&lt;/i&gt; decision to call the Association's action private, the record raises no reason for alarm here. Save for the Sixth Circuit, every Court of Appeals to consider a state wide athletic association like the one here has found it a state actor. This majority view began taking shape even before &lt;i&gt;Tarkanian,&lt;/i&gt; which cited two such decisions approvingly, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 298 (and this was six years after &lt;i&gt;Blum, Rendell-Baker,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lugar,&lt;/i&gt; on which the Sixth Circuit relied here). No one, however, has pointed to any explosion of &#167; 1983 cases against interscholastic athletic associations in the affected jurisdictions. Not to put too fine a point on it, two District Courts in Tennessee have previously held the Association itself to be a state actor, see &lt;i&gt;Graham,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;1995&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;WL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;115890&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, at *5; &lt;i&gt;Crocker&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Assn.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/tnmd/8tTK/crocker-v-tennessee-secondary-sch-athletic-assn/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;735&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;753&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (MD Tenn. 1990), affirmance order, 908 F. 2d 972, 973 (CA6 1990), but there is no evident wave of litigation working its way across the State. A reversal of the judgment here portends nothing more than the harmony of an outlying Circuit with precedent otherwise uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor do we think there is anything to be said for the Association's contention that there is no need to treat it as a state actor since any public school applying the Association's rules is itself subject to suit under &#167; 1983 or Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, 20 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 1681&#151; 1688. Brief for Respondents 30. If Brentwood's claim were pushing at the edge of the class of possible defendant state actors, an argument about the social utility of expanding &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*305&lt;/span&gt; that class would at least be on point, but because we are nowhere near the margin in this case, the Association is really asking for nothing less than a dispensation for itself. Its position boils down to saying that the Association should not be dressed in state clothes because other, concededly public actors are; that Brentwood should be kept out of court because a different plaintiff raising a different claim in a different case may find the courthouse open. Pleas for special treatment are hard to sell, although saying that does not, of course, imply anything about the merits of Brentwood's complaint; the issue here is merely whether Brentwood properly names the Association as a &#167; 1983 defendant, not whether it should win on its claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have never found state action based upon mere "entwinement." Until today, we have found a private organization's acts to constitute state action only when the organization performed a public function; was created, coerced, or encouraged by the government; or acted in a symbiotic relationship with the government. The majority's holding&#151; that the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association's (TSSAA) enforcement of its recruiting rule is state action&#151; not only extends state-action doctrine beyond its permissible limits but also encroaches upon the realm of individual freedom that the doctrine was meant to protect. I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the state-action requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment, the state-action element of 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1983 excludes from its coverage "merely private conduct, however &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*306&lt;/span&gt; discriminatory or wrongful." &lt;i&gt;American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Sullivan,&lt;/i&gt; 526 U. S. 40, 50 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). "Careful adherence to the `state action' requirement" thus "preserves an area of individual freedom by limiting the reach of federal law and federal judicial power." &lt;i&gt;Lugar&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Edmondson Oil Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 457 U. S. 922, 936 (1982). The state-action doctrine also promotes important values of federalism, "avoid[ing] the imposition of responsibility on a State for conduct it could not control." &lt;i&gt;National Collegiate Athletic Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tarkanian,&lt;/i&gt; 488 U. S. 179, 191 (1988). Although we have used many different tests to identify state action, they all have a common purpose. Our goal in every case is to determine whether an action "can fairly be attributed to the State." &lt;i&gt;Blum&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Yaretsky,&lt;/i&gt; 457 U. S. 991, 1004 (1982); &lt;i&gt;American Mfrs., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 52.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of these various tests for state action, common sense dictates that the TSSAA's actions cannot fairly be attributed to the State, and thus cannot constitute state action. The TSSAA was formed in 1925 as a private corporation to organize interscholastic athletics and to sponsor tournaments among its member schools. Any private or public secondary school may join the TSSAA by signing a contract agreeing to comply with its rules and decisions. Although public schools currently compose 84% of the TSSAA's membership, the TSSAA does not require that public schools constitute a set percentage of its membership, and, indeed, no public school need join the TSSAA. The TSSAA's rules are enforced not by a state agency but by its own board of control, which comprises high school principals, assistant principals, and superintendents, none of whom must work at a public school. Of course, at the time the recruiting rule was enforced in this case, all of the board members happened to be public school officials. However, each board member acts in &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*307&lt;/span&gt; a representative capacity on behalf of all the private and public schools in his region of Tennessee, and not simply his individual school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State of Tennessee did not create the TSSAA. The State does not fund the TSSAA and does not pay its employees.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; In fact, only 4% of the TSSAA's revenue comes from the dues paid by member schools; the bulk of its operating budget is derived from gate receipts at tournaments it sponsors. The State does not permit the TSSAA to use stateowned facilities for a discounted fee, and it does not exempt the TSSAA from state taxation. No Tennessee law authorizes the State to coordinate interscholastic athletics or empowers another entity to organize interscholastic athletics on behalf of the State.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; The only state pronouncement acknowledging &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*308&lt;/span&gt; the TSSAA's existence is a rule providing that the State Board of Education permits public schools to maintain membership in the TSSAA if they so choose.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the State of Tennessee has never had any involvement in the particular action taken by the TSSAA in this case: the enforcement of the TSSAA's recruiting rule prohibiting members from using "undue influence" on students or their parents or guardians "to secure or to retain a student for athletic purposes." App. 115. There is no indication that the State has ever had any interest in how schools choose to regulate recruiting.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; In fact, the TSSAA's authority to enforce its recruiting rule arises solely from the voluntary membership contract that each member school signs, agreeing to conduct its athletics in accordance with the rules and decisions of the TSSAA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even approaching the issue in terms of any of the Court's specific state-action tests, the conclusion is the same: The TSSAA's enforcement of its recruiting rule against Brentwood Academy is not state action. In applying these tests, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*309&lt;/span&gt; courts of course must place the burden of persuasion on the plaintiff, not the defendant, because state action is an element of a &#167; 1983 claim. &lt;i&gt;American Mfrs.,&lt;/i&gt; 526 U. S., at 49-50; &lt;i&gt;West&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Atkins,&lt;/i&gt; 487 U. S. 42, 48 (1988).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TSSAA has not performed a function that has been "traditionally exclusively reserved to the State." &lt;i&gt;Jackson&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Metropolitan Edison Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 419 U. S. 345, 352 (1974). The organization of interscholastic sports is neither a traditional nor an exclusive public function of the States. Widespread organization and administration of interscholastic contests by schools did not begin until the 20th century. See M. Lee, A History of Physical Education and Sports in the U. S. A. 73 (1983) (explaining that what little interscholastic athletics there was in the 19th century "came almost entirely in the closing decade of the century and was largely pupil inspired, pupil controlled, and pupil coached"); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 68, 146 (stating that no control of high school sports occurred until 1896, when a group of teachers in Wisconsin set up a committee to control such contests, and pointing out that "[i]t was several years before the idea caught on in other states"). Certainly, in Tennessee, the State did not even show an interest in interscholastic athletics until 47 years after the TSSAA had been in existence and had been orchestrating athletic contests throughout the State. Even then, the State Board of Education merely acquiesced in the TSSAA's actions and did not assume the role of regulating interscholastic athletics. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Blum,&lt;/i&gt; 457 U. S., at 1004-1005 ("Mere approval of or acquiescence in the initiatives of a private party is not sufficient to justify holding the State responsible for those initiatives . . ."); see also &lt;i&gt;Flagg Bros., Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Brooks,&lt;/i&gt; 436 U. S. 149, 164-165 (1978). The TSSAA no doubt serves the public, particularly the public schools, but the mere provision of a service to the public does not render such provision a traditional and exclusive public function. See &lt;i&gt;RendellBaker&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kohn,&lt;/i&gt; 457 U. S. 830, 842 (1982).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*310&lt;/span&gt; It is also obvious that the TSSAA is not an entity created and controlled by the government for the purpose of fulfilling a government objective, as was Amtrak in &lt;i&gt;Lebron&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;National Railroad Passenger Corporation,&lt;/i&gt; 513 U. S. 374, 394 (1995). See also &lt;i&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Board of Directors of City Trusts of Philadelphia,&lt;/i&gt; 353 U. S. 230 (1957) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; (holding that a state agency created under state law was a state actor). Indeed, no one claims that the State of Tennessee played any role in the creation of the TSSAA as a private corporation in 1925. The TSSAA was designed to fulfill an objective&#151;the organization of interscholastic athletic tournaments&#151;that the government had not contemplated, much less pursued. And although the board of control currently is composed of public school officials, and although public schools currently account for the majority of the TSSAA's membership, this is not required by the TSSAA's constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the State of Tennessee has not "exercised coercive power or . . . provided such significant encouragement [to the TSSAA], either overt or covert," &lt;i&gt;Blum,&lt;/i&gt; 457 U. S., at 1004, that the TSSAA's regulatory activities must in law be deemed to be those of the State. The State has not promulgated any regulations of interscholastic sports, and nothing in the record suggests that the State has encouraged or coerced the TSSAA in enforcing its recruiting rule. To be sure, public schools do provide a small portion of the TSSAA's funding through their membership dues, but no one argues that these dues are somehow conditioned on the TSSAA's enactment and enforcement of recruiting rules.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*311&lt;/span&gt; Likewise, even if the TSSAA were dependent on state funding to the extent of 90%, as was the case in &lt;i&gt;Blum,&lt;/i&gt; instead of less than 4%, mere financial dependence on the State does not convert the TSSAA's actions into acts of the State. See &lt;i&gt;Blum, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 1011; &lt;i&gt;Rendell-Baker, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 840; see also &lt;i&gt;Moose Lodge No. 107&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Irvis,&lt;/i&gt; 407 U. S. 163, 173 (1972) ("The Court has never held, of course, that discrimination by an otherwise private entity would be violative of the Equal Protection Clause if the private entity receives any sort of benefit or service at all from the State . . ."). Furthermore, there is no evidence of "joint participation," &lt;i&gt;Lugar,&lt;/i&gt; 457 U. S., at 941-942, between the State and the TSSAA in the TSSAA's enforcement of its recruiting rule. The TSSAA's board of control enforces its recruiting rule solely in accordance with the authority granted to it under the contract that each member signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is no "symbiotic relationship" between the State and the TSSAA. &lt;i&gt;Moose Lodge, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 175; cf. &lt;i&gt;Burton&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wilmington Parking Authority,&lt;/i&gt; 365 U. S. 715 (1961). Contrary to the majority's assertion, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 299-300, the TSSAA's "fiscal relationship with the State is not different from that of many contractors performing services for the government." &lt;i&gt;Rendell-Baker, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 843. The TSSAA provides a service&#151;the organization of athletic tournaments&#151;in exchange for membership dues and gate fees, just as a vendor could contract with public schools to sell refreshments at school events. Certainly the public school could sell its own refreshments, yet the existence of that option does not transform the service performed by the contractor into a state action. Also, there is no suggestion in this case that, as was the case in &lt;i&gt;Burton,&lt;/i&gt; the State profits from the TSSAA's decision to enforce its recruiting rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*312&lt;/span&gt; Because I do not believe that the TSSAA's action of enforcing its recruiting rule is fairly attributable to the State of Tennessee, I would affirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the TSSAA's enforcement activities cannot be considered state action as a matter of common sense or under any of this Court's existing theories of state action, the majority presents a new theory. Under this theory, the majority holds that the combination of factors it identifies evidences "entwinement" of the State with the TSSAA, and that such entwinement converts private action into state action. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 296-297. The majority does not define "entwinement," and the meaning of the term is not altogether clear. But whatever this new "entwinement" theory may entail, it lacks any support in our state-action jurisprudence. Although the majority asserts that there are three examples of entwinement analysis in our cases, there is no case in which we have rested a finding of state action on entwinement alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the cases on which the majority relies do not even use the word "entwinement." See &lt;i&gt;Lebron&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;National Railroad Passenger Corporation, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Board of Directors of City Trusts of Philadelphia, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;. Lebron&lt;/i&gt; concerned the status of Amtrak, a corporation that Congress created and placed under Government control for the specific purpose of achieving a governmental objective (namely, to avert the threatened extinction of passenger train service in the United States). 513 U. S., at 383, 386. Without discussing any notion of entwinement, we simply held that, when "the Government creates a corporation by special law, for the furtherance of governmental objectives, and retains for itself permanent authority to appoint a majority of the directors of that corporation, the corporation is part of the Government for purposes of the First Amendment." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 400. Similarly, in &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*313&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;City Trusts,&lt;/i&gt; we did not consider entwinement when we addressed the question whether an agency established by state law was a state actor. See 353 U. S., at 231. In that case, the Pennsylvania Legislature passed a law creating a board of directors to operate a racially segregated school for orphans. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Without mentioning "entwinement," we held that, because the board was a state agency, its actions were attributable to the State. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority's third example, &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Newton,&lt;/i&gt; 382 U. S. 296 (1966), lends no more support to an "entwinement" theory than do &lt;i&gt;Lebron&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;City Trusts.&lt;/i&gt; Although &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; at least uses the word "entwined," 382 U. S., at 299 ("Conduct that is formally `private' may become so entwined with governmental policies or so impregnated with a governmental character as to become subject to the constitutional limitations placed upon state action"), we did not discuss entwinement as a distinct concept, let alone one sufficient to transform a private entity into a state actor when traditional theories of state action do not. On the contrary, our analysis rested on the recognition that the subject of the dispute, a park, served a "public function," much like a fire department or a police department. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 302. A park, we noted, is a "public facility" that "serves the community." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 301&#151; 302. Even if the city severed all ties to the park and placed its operation in private hands, the park still would be "municipal in nature," analogous to other public facilities that have given rise to a finding of state action: the streets of a company town in &lt;i&gt;Marsh&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Alabama,&lt;/i&gt; 326 U. S. 501 (1946), the elective process in &lt;i&gt;Terry&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Adams,&lt;/i&gt; 345 U. S. 461 (1953), and the transit system in &lt;i&gt;Public Util. Comm'n of D. C.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pollak,&lt;/i&gt; 343 U. S. 451 (1952). 382 U. S., at 301-302. Because the park served public functions, the private trustees operating the park were considered to be state actors.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*314&lt;/span&gt; These cases, therefore, cannot support the majority's "entwinement" theory. Only &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; speaks of entwinement at all, and it does not do so in the same broad sense as does the majority.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; Moreover, these cases do not suggest that the TSSAA's activities can be considered state action, whether the label for the state-action theory is "entwinement" or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the majority never defines "entwinement," the scope of its holding is unclear. If we are fortunate, the majority's fact-specific analysis will have little bearing beyond this case. But if the majority's new entwinement test develops in future years, it could affect many organizations that foster activities, enforce rules, and sponsor extracurricular competition among high schools&#151;not just in athletics, but in such diverse areas as agriculture, mathematics, music, marching bands, forensics, and cheerleading. Indeed, this entwinement test may extend to other organizations that are composed of, or controlled by, public officials or public entities, such as firefighters, policemen, teachers, cities, or counties. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*315&lt;/span&gt; I am not prepared to say that any private organization that permits public entities and public officials to participate acts as the State in anything or everything it does, and our state-action jurisprudence has never reached that far. The state-action doctrine was developed to reach only those actions that are truly attributable to the State, not to subject private citizens to the control of federal courts hearing &#167; 1983 actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

I.1992); see also &lt;i&gt;Moreland&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Western Penn. Interscholastic Athletic League,&lt;/i&gt; 572 F. 2d 121, 125 (CA3 1978) (state action conceded).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  If a defendant's conduct satisfies the state-action requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment, the conduct also constitutes action "under color of state law" for &#167; 1983 purposes. &lt;i&gt;Lugar&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Edmondson Oil Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 457 U. S. 922, 935 (1982).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  The District Court in &lt;i&gt;Graham&lt;/i&gt; held that "[t]his delegation of authority to TSSAA by Tennessee, standing alone, is sufficient to make TSSAA a state actor" under the "state compulsion test," which it understood to provide that a State could exercise such coercive power or provide such significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that the choice of the private actor must be deemed to be that of the State as a matter of law. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;1995&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;WL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;115890&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, at *4&#151;*5 (citing &lt;i&gt;Blum&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Yaretsky,&lt;/i&gt; 457 U. S. 991, 1004 (1982)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  The significance of winks and nods in state-action doctrine seems to be one of the points of the dissenters' departure from the rest of the Court. In drawing the public-private action line, the dissenters would emphasize the formal clarity of the legislative action providing for the appointment of Girard College's trustees, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 296-297; &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 310, in preference to our reliance on the practical certainty in this case that public officials will control operation of the Association under its bylaws. Similarly, the dissenters stress the express formality of the special statute defining Amtrak's ties to the Government, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 296; &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 310, in contrast to the reality in this case that the Association's organizers structured the Association's relationships to the officialdom of public education. But if formalism were the &lt;i&gt;sine qua non&lt;/i&gt; of state action, the doctrine would vanish owing to the ease and inevitability of its evasion, and for just that reason formalism has never been controlling. For example, a criterion of state action like symbiosis (which the dissenters accept, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt;  at 311) looks not to form but to an underlying reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Although the TSSAA's employees, who typically are retired teachers, are allowed to participate in the state retirement system, the State does not pay any portion of the employer contribution for them. The TSSAA is one of three private associations, along with the Tennessee Education Association and the Tennessee School Boards Association, whose employees are statutorily permitted to participate in the state retirement system. Tenn. Code Ann. &#167; 8-35-118 (1993).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The first formal state acknowledgment of the TSSAA's existence did not occur until 1972, when the State Board of Education passed a resolution stating that it "recognizes and designates [the TSSAA] as the organization to supervise and regulate the athletic activities in which the public junior and senior high schools of Tennessee participate in on an interscholastic basis." App. 211. There is no indication that the TSSAA invited this resolution or that the resolution in any way altered the actions of the TSSAA or the State following its adoption in 1972. In fact, it appears that the resolution was not entirely accurate: The TSSAA does not supervise or regulate regular season interscholastic contests. In any event, the resolution was revoked in 1996. Contrary to the majority's reference to its revocation as being "winks and nods," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 301, the repeal of the 1972 resolution appears to have had no more impact on the TSSAA's operation than did its passage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority also cites this resolution to support its assertion that "[e]ver since the Association was incorporated in 1925, Tennessee's State Board of Education . . . has acknowledged the corporation's function `in providing standards, rules and regulations for interscholastic competition in the public schools of Tennessee.' " &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 292. However, there is no evidence in the record that suggests that the State of Tennessee or the State Board of Education had any involvement or interest in the TSSAA prior to 1972.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  The Rule provides: "The State Board of Education recognizes the value of participation in interscholastic athletics and the role of the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association in coordinating interscholastic athletic competition. The State Board of Education authorizes the public schools of the state to voluntarily maintain membership in the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association." Tenn. Comp. Rules &amp;amp; Regs. &#167; 0520-1&#151;2&#151;.08(1) (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  The majority relies on the fact that the TSSAA permits members of the State Board of Education to serve ex officio on its board of control to support its "top-down" theory of state action. But these members are not voting members of the TSSAA's board of control and thus cannot exert any control over its actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  The majority emphasizes that public schools joining the TSSAA "give up sources of their own income to their collective association" by allowing the TSSAA "to charge for admission to their games." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 299. However, this would be equally true whenever a State contracted with a private entity: The State presumably could provide the same service for profit, if it so chose. In &lt;i&gt;Rendell-Baker&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kohn,&lt;/i&gt; 457 U. S. 830 (1982), for example, the State could have created its own school for students with special needs and charged for admission. Or in &lt;i&gt;Blum&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Yaretsky,&lt;/i&gt; 457 U. S. 991 (1982), the State could have created its own nursing homes and charged individuals to stay there. The ability of a State to make money by performing a service it has chosen to buy from a private entity is hardly an indication that the service provider is a state actor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  We have used the word "entwined" in another case, &lt;i&gt;Gilmore&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Montgomery,&lt;/i&gt; 417 U. S. 556, 565 (1974), which the majority does not cite. In &lt;i&gt;Gilmore,&lt;/i&gt; we held that a city could not grant exclusive use of public facilities to racially segregated groups. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 566. The city, we determined, was "engaged in an elaborate subterfuge" to circumvent a court order desegregating the city's recreational facilities. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 567. The grant of exclusive authority was little different from a formal agreement to run a segregated recreational program. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Thus, although we quoted the "entwined" language from &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Newton,&lt;/i&gt; 382 U. S. 296 (1966), we were not using the term in the same loose sense the majority uses it today. And there is certainly no suggestion that the TSSAA has structured its recruiting rule specifically to evade review of an activity that previously was deemed to be unconstitutional state action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  The majority's reference to &lt;i&gt;National Collegiate Athletic Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tarkanian,&lt;/i&gt; 488 U. S. 179 (1988), as foreshadowing this case, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 297-298, also does not support its conclusion. Indeed, the reference to &lt;i&gt;Tarkanian&lt;/i&gt;  is ironic because it is not difficult to imagine that application of the majority's entwinement test could change the result reached in that case, so that the National Collegiate Athletic Association's actions could be found to be state action given its large number of public institution members that virtually control the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;No. 99-1792.&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Decided February 20, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MISSOURI
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*317&lt;/span&gt; Thomas, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;James R. Layton,&lt;/i&gt; State Solicitor of Missouri, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Jeremiah W. (Jay) Nixon,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General of Missouri, and &lt;i&gt;Gail Vasterling&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;David Lieber,&lt;/i&gt; Assistant Attorneys General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;David C. Frederick&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Acting Assistant Attorney General Junghans, Deputy Solicitor General Wallace, David English Carmack,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Donald B. Tobin.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Richard A. Hanson&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Theodore R. Bots.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*318&lt;/span&gt; Justice Thomas, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case we are asked to decide whether the National Bank for Cooperatives, which Congress has designated as a federally chartered instrumentality of the United States, is exempt from state income taxation. We hold that it is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Farm Credit Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 257, as amended, 12 U. S. C. &#167; 2001 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; Congress created various lending institutions within the Farm Credit System to meet the specific credit needs of farmers. Among these institutions were banks for cooperatives, one in each of 12 farm credit districts, and a Central Bank for Cooperatives. These banks were designed to make loans to cooperative associations engaged in marketing farm products, purchasing farm supplies, or furnishing farm services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the Farm Credit System includes banks for cooperatives, production credit associations, farm credit banks, and federal land bank associations. &#167; 2002(a). By statute, each of these institutions is designated as a "federally chartered instrumentalit[y] of the United States." &#167; 2121 (banks for cooperatives and Central Bank for Cooperatives); &#167; 2141 (National Bank for Cooperatives); &#167;&#167; 2071(a) and (b)(7) (production credit associations); &#167; 2011(a) (farm credit banks); &#167;&#167; 2091(a) and (b)(4) (federal land bank associations). The Farm Credit Act also addresses the taxation of these institutions. The provision applicable to a bank for cooperatives, the institution at issue in this case, states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Each bank for cooperatives and its obligations are instrumentalities of the United States and as such any and all notes, debentures, and other obligations issued by such bank shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*319&lt;/span&gt; and gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by the United States or any State, territorial, or local taxing authority, except that interest on such obligations shall be subject to Federal income taxation in the hands of the holder." &#167; 2134.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent CoBank ACB is the successor to all rights and obligations of the National Bank for Cooperatives, which had been formed in 1989 through the consolidation of 10 district banks for cooperatives and the Central Bank for Cooperatives.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The National Bank for Cooperatives filed Missouri corporate income tax returns for the years 1991 through 1994 and paid the taxes shown on those returns. In March 1996, CoBank filed amended returns on behalf of the National Bank for Cooperatives, requesting an exemption from all state income taxes and refunds on the taxes paid&#151;erroneously, it alleged&#151;for 1991 through 1994. Relying on the doctrine of implied tax immunity that originated in &lt;i&gt;McCulloch&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maryland,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/7LyH/mcculloch-v-maryland/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wheat.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;316&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1819), CoBank asserted that the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution accords federal instrumentalities immunity from state taxation unless Congress has expressly waived this immunity. CoBank argued that, because the current version of the Farm Credit Act does not expressly waive this immunity, banks for cooperatives are exempt from Missouri's corporate income tax. The Director of Revenue of Missouri denied the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On appeal, the Administrative Hearing Commission upheld the Director of Revenue's assessment of corporate income tax, because the National Bank for Cooperatives had not established that it was a federal instrumentality statutorily exempt from state taxation of its income. The commission determined that Congress did not provide expressly that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*320&lt;/span&gt; banks for cooperatives, in contrast to farm credit banks and federal land bank associations, would have immunity from state income taxation. The commission reasoned that had Congress intended to confer upon banks for cooperatives the same immunity that was provided to farm credit banks and federal land bank associations, it would have done so expressly. For jurisdictional reasons, the commission did not decide CoBank's constitutional claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Missouri Supreme Court reversed the commission's decision and held that banks for cooperatives are exempt from state income taxation.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Production Credit Assn. of Southeastern Mo.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Director of Revenue,&lt;/i&gt; 10 S. W. 3d 142, 143 (2000). The Missouri Supreme Court held that the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution provides federal instrumentalities immunity from state taxation unless Congress has expressly waived this immunity. According to the Missouri Supreme Court, because the current version of the Farm Credit Act is silent as to such institutions' immunity from state taxation, Congress cannot be said to have expressly consented to state income taxation and, thus, the institutions are exempt from state income taxes. The Missouri Supreme Court noted that other courts that had addressed the issue of state taxation of member institutions of the Farm Credit System also had concluded that the States could not tax such institutions. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 143-144 (citing &lt;i&gt;Farm Credit Servs. of Central Ark., PCA&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arkansas,&lt;/i&gt; 76 F. 3d 961, 964 (CA8 1996), rev'd on other grounds, 520 U. S. 821 (1997); &lt;i&gt;State&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Farm Credit Servs. of Central Ark.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ark/dzGT/state-v-farm-credit-services-of-cent-ark/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;338&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ark.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;322&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 327, 994 S. W. 2d 453, 456 (1999), cert. denied, 529 U. S. 1036 (2000); &lt;i&gt;Northwest La. Production Credit Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; 98-1995 (La. App. 11/5/99), 746 So. 2d 280).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Mexico Court of Appeals and the Indiana Supreme Court have reached the opposite conclusion with &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*321&lt;/span&gt; respect to state taxation of production credit associations. See &lt;i&gt;Production Credit Assn. of Eastern N. M.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Taxation and Revenue Dept.,&lt;/i&gt; 2000 NMCA-021 &#182; 26, 999 P. 2d 1031, 1038, cert. denied, 128 N. M. 688, 997 P. 2d 820 (2000); &lt;i&gt;Indiana Dept. of State Revenue&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Farm Credit Servs. of MidAmerica, ACA,&lt;/i&gt; 734 N. E. 2d 551, 560 (Ind. 2000). Since the statutory history and provisions regarding the taxation of production credit associations and banks for cooperatives are virtually identical, compare 12 U. S. C. &#167; 2077 with &#167; 2134; compare Farm Credit Act of 1971, &#167; 2.17, 85 Stat. 602, with &#167; 3.13, 85 Stat. 608; compare Farm Credit Amendments Act of 1985, &#167; 205(d)(16), 99 Stat. 1705, with &#167; 205(e)(10), 99 Stat. 1705,&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; we granted certiorari to resolve this conflict. 530 U. S. 1260 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress has expressly designated banks for cooperatives as "instrumentalities of the United States." 12 U. S. C. &#167; 2121. We have held, in addressing state taxation of contractors conducting business with the United States, that an instrumentality is entitled to implied tax immunity only when it is "so closely connected to the Government that the two cannot realistically be viewed as separate entities." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New Mexico,&lt;/i&gt; 455 U. S. 720, 735 (1982). Relying on &lt;i&gt;New Mexico,&lt;/i&gt; the Director of Revenue argues that banks for cooperatives are not "so closely connected" to the United States as to be indistinguishable from the United States, and that banks for cooperatives thus are not entitled to immunity from state taxation. CoBank disagrees with this characterization and asks us to conclude that banks for cooperatives are indeed virtual arms of the United States, worthy of implied tax immunity under &lt;i&gt;McCulloch.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need not, however, reach this implied immunity question. Implied immunity becomes an issue only when Congress has failed to indicate whether an instrumentality is &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*322&lt;/span&gt; subject to state taxation. In this case, Congress has provided that banks for cooperatives are subject to state taxation. To be sure, Congress did not include an express statement in the current version of &#167; 2134. However, nothing in the statute indicates a repeal of the previous express approval of state taxation, and the structure of the Farm Credit Act indicates by negative implication that banks for cooperatives are not entitled to immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon their creation in 1933, banks for cooperatives were subject to state income taxation except during periods when the United States held stock in the banks. Farm Credit Act of 1933, &#167; 63, 48 Stat. 267 ("Such banks, . . . and their income, shall be exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by the United States or by any State, Territorial, or local taxing authority . . . . The exemption provided herein shall not apply . . . with respect to . . . any . . . Bank for Cooperatives, or its property or income after the stock held in it by the United States has been retired"). Under this statute, as soon as governmental investment in a bank for cooperatives was repaid (as it was for all such banks by 1968), the bank had to pay state income taxes because the exemption from such taxation no longer applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Congress amended the Farm Credit Act in 1971, it did not change the rule that banks for cooperatives are subject to state taxation unless the United States holds stock in the banks. Farm Credit Act of 1971, &#167; 3.13, 85 Stat. 608. Although all banks for cooperatives were at the time privately owned, Congress provided that the Governor of the Farm Credit Administration had the authority on behalf of the United States to purchase stock in banks for cooperatives "as a temporary investment in the stock of the institution to help one or several of the banks . . . to meet emergency credit needs of borrowers." &#167; 4.0, 85 Stat. 609. The 1971 version of &#167; 2134 therefore provided, in relevant part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*323&lt;/span&gt; "Such banks . . . and their income shall be exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by the United States or by any State, territorial, or local taxing authority . . . . The exemption provided in the preceding sentence shall apply only for any year or part thereof in which stock in the bank for cooperatives is held by the Governor of the Farm Credit Administration." &#167; 3.13, 85 Stat. 608-609.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1985, Congress enacted various amendments to the Act. Among other things, these amendments eliminated the position of Governor of the Farm Credit Administration, discontinued the Farm Credit Administration's authority to own stock in banks for cooperatives, and included numerous "Technical and Conforming Amendments." Farm Credit Amendments Act of 1985, &#167; 201, 99 Stat. 1688; &#167; 101, 99 Stat. 1678; &#167; 205, 99 Stat. 1703-1707. One of these technical and conforming amendments was the deletion of the two sentences within &#167; 2134 that, first, exempted a bank for cooperatives from state taxation and, second, limited that exemption to periods when the Governor held stock in the bank. &#167; 205(e)(10), 99 Stat. 1705, as amended, 12 U. S. C. &#167; 2134.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CoBank argues that the deletion of these two sentences altered the States' ability to tax the income of banks for cooperatives. According to CoBank, because the deletion eliminated the express statutory authorization for such taxation, Congress intended banks for cooperatives to be immune from state taxation under &lt;i&gt;McCulloch&lt;/i&gt; `s implied immunity doctrine. We do not share CoBank's interpretation as to the effect of this amendment, because there is no indication that Congress intended to change the taxation of banks for cooperatives with the 1985 amendments. Since 1933, the States could collect revenue from banks for cooperatives. Nothing in the 1985 amendments expressly changes this. And, it would be surprising, indeed, if Congress had eliminated this important fact &lt;i&gt;sub silentio.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*324&lt;/span&gt; CoBank's interpretation would mean that Congress made a radical&#151;but entirely implicit&#151;change in the taxation of banks for cooperatives with the 1985 amendment to &#167; 2134. The amendment to &#167; 2134 was merely one of numerous "technical and conforming amendments" to the Farm Credit Act. Farm Credit Amendments Act of 1985, &#167; 205, 99 Stat. 1703&#151; 1707 (section entitled "Technical and Conforming Amendments"). In fact, the deletion of the sentence within &#167; 2134 referring to the Governor was one of more than 30 deletions of references to the Governor, a position eliminated by the 1985 amendments to the Act. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; The more logical interpretation of this amendment to &#167; 2134 is that Congress merely deleted language that had become superfluous once the United States no longer owned, and no longer could own, stock in banks for cooperatives. This explanation accords with the more than 50-year history of the Farm Credit Act, permitting the States to tax banks for cooperatives except when there was governmental investment in the banks. Had Congress simply deleted the final sentence of &#167; 2134 that limited the exemption while retaining the sentence granting the exemption, we would have no trouble concluding that Congress had eliminated the States' ability to tax banks for cooperatives. Short of this act, however, we find Congress' silence insufficient to disrupt the 50-year history of state taxation of banks for cooperatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the structure of the Farm Credit Act confirms that banks for cooperatives are subject to state taxation. With respect to each lending institution in the Farm Credit System, the Act contains a taxation provision that specifically delineates the immunity from taxation enjoyed by that entity. For example, farm credit banks and federal land bank associations receive the type of immunity from state taxation that the Missouri Supreme Court held to be implied here for banks for cooperatives. See 12 U. S. C. &#167; 2023 ("The &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*325&lt;/span&gt; Farm Credit Banks and the capital, reserves, and surplus thereof, and the income derived therefrom, shall be exempt from Federal, State, municipal, and local taxation . . ."); &#167; 2098 ("Each Federal land bank association and the capital, reserves, and surplus thereof, and the income derived therefrom, shall be exempt from Federal, State, municipal, and local taxation . . .").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, since their creation in 1933, banks for cooperatives have been granted only limited exemptions from taxation. Had Congress intended to confer upon banks for cooperatives the more comprehensive exemption from taxation that it had provided to farm credit banks and federal land bank associations, it would have done so expressly as it had done elsewhere in the Farm Credit Act. Thus, in light of the structure of the Farm Credit Act&#151;and the explicit grant of immunity to other institutions within the Farm Credit System&#151;Congress' silence with respect to banks for cooperatives indicates that banks for cooperatives are subject to state taxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Missouri Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Q. Wolfson,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Douglas N. Letter.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;U. S. Term Limits, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Thornton,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S. 779 (1995), we reviewed a challenge to an Arkansas law that prohibited the name of an otherwise eligible candidate for the United States Congress from appearing on the general election ballot if he or she had already served three terms in the House of Representatives or two terms in the Senate. We held that the ballot restriction was an indirect attempt to impose term limits on congressional incumbents that violated the Qualifications Clauses in Article I of the Constitution rather than a permissible exercise of the State's power to regulate the "Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives" within the meaning of Article I, &#167; 4, cl. 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to that decision, the voters of Missouri adopted in 1996 an amendment to Article VIII&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; of their State Constitution designed to lead to the adoption of a specified "Congressional Term Limits Amendment" to the Federal Constitution. At issue in this case is the constitutionality of Article VIII.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*514&lt;/span&gt; I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article VIII "instruct[s]" each Member of Missouri's congressional delegation "to use all of his or her delegated powers to pass the Congressional Term Limits Amendment" set forth in &#167; 16 of the Article. Mo. Const., Art. VIII, &#167; 17(1). That proposed amendment would limit service in the United States Congress to three terms in the House of Representatives and two terms in the Senate.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three provisions in Article VIII combine to advance its purpose. Section 17 prescribes that the statement "DISREGARDED VOTERS' INSTRUCTION ON TERM LIMITS" be printed on all primary and general ballots adjacent to the name of a Senator or Representative who fails to take any one of eight legislative acts in support of the proposed amendment.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Section 18 provides that the statement "DE- &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*515&lt;/span&gt; CLINED TO PLEDGE TO SUPPORT TERM LIMITS" be printed on all primary and general election ballots next to the name of every nonincumbent congressional candidate who refuses to take a "Term Limit" pledge that commits the candidate, if elected, to performing the legislative acts enumerated in &#167; 17.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; And &#167; 19 directs the Missouri Secretary of State to determine and declare, pursuant to &#167;&#167; 17 and 18, whether either statement should be printed alongside the name of each candidate for Congress.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*516&lt;/span&gt; Respondent Don Gralike was a nonincumbent candidate for election in 1998 to the United States House of Representatives from Missouri's Third Congressional District. A month after Article VIII was amended, Gralike brought suit&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri to enjoin petitioner, the Secretary of State of Missouri, from implementing the Article, which the complaint alleges violates several provisions of the Federal Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Court decided the case on the pleadings, granting Gralike's motion for summary judgment. The court first held that Article VIII contravened the Qualifications Clauses of Article I of the Federal Constitution because it "has the sole purpose of creating additional qualifications for Congress indirectly and has the likely effect of handicapping a class of candidates for Congress." 996 F. Supp. 917, 920 (1998); see 996 F. Supp. 901, 905-909 (1998). The court further held that Article VIII places an impermissible burden on the candidates' First Amendment right to speak freely on the issue of term limits by "punish[ing] candidates for speaking out against term limits" through putting "negative words next to their names on the ballot," and by "us[ing] the threat of being disadvantaged in the election to coerce candidates into taking a position on the term limits issue." 996 F. Supp., at 910; see 996 F. Supp., at 920. Lastly, the court found Article VIII to be an indirect and unconstitutional attempt by the people of Missouri to interject themselves into the amending process authorized by Article V of the Federal Constitution. In doing so, the court endorsed the reasoning of other decisions invalidating provisions similar &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*517&lt;/span&gt; to Article VIII on the ground that negative ballot designations "place an undue influence on the legislator to vote in favor of term limits rather than exercise his or her own independent judgment as is contemplated by Article V." 996 F. Supp., at 916; see 996 F. Supp., at 920.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; Accordingly, the court permanently enjoined petitioner from enforcing &#167;&#167; 15 through 19 of Article VIII.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; Like the District Court, it found that Article VIII "threatens a penalty that is serious enough to compel candidates to speak&#151;the potential political damage of the ballot labels"; "seeks to impose an additional qualification for candidacy for Congress and does so in a manner which is highly likely to handicap term limit opponents and other labeled candidates"; and "coerce[s] legislators into proposing or ratifying a particular constitutional amendment" in violation of Article V. 191 F. 3d 911, 918, 924, 925 (1999). The Court of Appeals also observed that, contrary to the Speech or Debate Clause in Art. I, &#167; 6, cl. 1, of the Federal Constitution, Article VIII "establishes a regime in which a state officer&#151;the secretary of state&#151;is permitted to judge and punish Members of Congress for their legislative actions or positions." 191 F. 3d, at 922.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*518&lt;/span&gt; Although the Court of Appeals' decision is consistent with the views of other courts that have passed on similar voter initiatives,&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; the importance of the case prompted our grant of certiorari. 529 U. S. 1065 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article VIII furthers the State's interest in adding a term limits amendment to the Federal Constitution in two ways. It encourages Missouri's congressional delegation to support such an amendment in order to avoid an unfavorable ballot designation when running for reelection. And it encourages the election of representatives who favor such an amendment. Petitioner argues that Article VIII is an exercise of the "right of the people to instruct" their representatives reserved by the Tenth Amendment,&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; and that it is a permissible regulation of the "manner" of electing federal legislators within the authority delegated to the States by the Elections Clause, Art. I, &#167; 4, cl. 1.&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt; Because these two arguments rely on different sources of state power, it is &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*519&lt;/span&gt; appropriate at the outset to review the distinction in kind between powers reserved to the States and those delegated to the States by the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we discussed at length in &lt;i&gt;U. S. Term Limits,&lt;/i&gt; the Constitution "draws a basic distinction between the powers of the newly created Federal Government and the powers retained by the pre-existing sovereign States." 514 U. S., at 801. On the one hand, in the words of Chief Justice Marshall, "it was neither necessary nor proper to define the powers retained by the States. These powers proceed, not from the people of America, but from the people of the several States; and remain, after the adoption of the constitution, what they were before, except so far as they may be abridged by that instrument." &lt;i&gt;Sturges&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Crowninshield,&lt;/i&gt; 4 Wheat. 122, 193 (1819). The text of the Tenth Amendment delineates this principle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, as Justice Story observed, "the states can exercise no powers whatsoever, which exclusively spring out of the existence of the national government, which the constitution did not delegate to them." 1 Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States &#167; 627 (3d ed. 1858) (hereinafter Story). Simply put, "[n]o state can say, that it has reserved, what it never possessed." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;III&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be persuasive, petitioner's argument that Article VIII is a valid exercise of the State's reserved power to give binding instructions to its representatives would have to overcome three hurdles. First, the historical precedents on &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*520&lt;/span&gt; which she relies for the proposition that the States have such a reserved power are distinguishable. Second, there is countervailing historical evidence. Third, and of decisive significance, the means employed to issue the instructions, ballots for congressional elections, are unacceptable unless Article VIII is a permissible exercise of the State's power to regulate the manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives. Only a brief comment on the first two points is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner relies heavily on the part instructions played in the Second Continental Congress, the Constitutional Convention, the early Congress, the selection of United States Senators before the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment, and the ratification of certain federal constitutional amendments.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt; However, unlike Article VIII, none of petitioner's examples was coupled with an express legal sanction for disobedience.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; At best, as an &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; for petitioner points out, and as petitioner herself acknowledges, such historical instructions at one point in the early Republic may have had "de facto binding force" because it might have been "political suicide" not to follow them.&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt; This evidence falls short of demonstrating that either the people or the States &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*521&lt;/span&gt; had a right to give legally binding, &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; nonadvisory, instructions to their representatives that the Tenth Amendment reserved, much less that such a right would apply to federal representatives. See &lt;i&gt;U. S. Term Limits, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Thornton,&lt;/i&gt;  514 U. S., at 802 (Tenth Amendment "could only `reserve' that which existed before"); cf. &lt;i&gt;McCulloch&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maryland,&lt;/i&gt; 4 Wheat. 316, 430 (1819) (rejecting argument that States had reserved power to tax corporations chartered by Congress because an "original right to tax" such federal entities "never existed").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, contrary evidence is provided by the fact that the First Congress rejected a proposal to insert a right of the people "to instruct their representatives" into what would become the First Amendment. 1 Annals of Cong. 732 (1789). The fact that the proposal was made suggests that its proponents thought it necessary, and the fact that it was rejected by a vote of 41 to 10, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 747, suggests that we should give weight to the views of those who opposed the proposal. It was their view that binding instructions would undermine an essential attribute of Congress by eviscerating the deliberative nature of that National Assembly. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 735 (remarks of Rep. Sherman) ("[W]hen the people have chosen a representative, it is his duty to meet others from the different parts of the Union, and consult, and agree with them to such acts as are for the general benefit of the whole community. If they were to be guided by instructions, there would be no use in deliberation; all that a man would have to do, would be to produce his instructions, and lay them on the table, and let them speak for him"). As a result, James Madison, then a Representative from Virginia, concluded that a right to issue binding instructions would "run the risk of losing the whole system." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 739; see also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 735 (remarks of Rep. Clymer) (proposed right to give binding instructions was "a most dangerous principle, utterly destructive of all ideas of an independent and deliberative &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*522&lt;/span&gt; body, which are essential requisites in the Legislatures of free Governments").&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, even assuming the existence of the reserved right that petitioner asserts (and that Article VIII falls within its ambit), the question remains whether the State may use ballots for congressional elections as a means of giving its instructions binding force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal offices at stake "aris[e] from the Constitution itself." &lt;i&gt;U. S. Term Limits, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Thornton,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S., at 805. Because any state authority to regulate election to those offices could not precede their very creation by the Constitution, such power "had to be delegated to, rather than reserved by, the States." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 804. Cf. 1 Story &#167; 627 ("It is no original prerogative of state power to appoint a representative, a senator, or president for the union"). Through the Elections Clause, the Constitution delegated to the States the power to regulate the "Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives," subject to a grant of authority to Congress to "make or alter such Regulations." Art. I, &#167; 4, cl. 1; see &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Classic,&lt;/i&gt; 313 U. S. 299, 315 (1941). No other constitutional &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*523&lt;/span&gt; provision gives the States authority over congressional elections, and no such authority could be reserved under the Tenth Amendment. By process of elimination, the States may regulate the incidents of such elections, including balloting, only within the exclusive delegation of power under the Elections Clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to the Elections Clause, petitioner argues that Article VIII "merely regulates the manner in which elections are held by disclosing information about congressional candidates."&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt; As such, petitioner concludes, Article VIII is a valid exercise of Missouri's delegated power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We disagree. To be sure, the Elections Clause grants to the States "broad power" to prescribe the procedural mechanisms for holding congressional elections. &lt;i&gt;Tashjian&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Republican Party of Conn.,&lt;/i&gt; 479 U. S. 208, 217 (1986); see also &lt;i&gt;Smiley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Holm,&lt;/i&gt; 285 U. S. 355, 366 (1932) ("It cannot be doubted that these comprehensive words embrace authority to provide a complete code for congressional elections"). Nevertheless, Article VIII falls outside of that grant of authority. As we made clear in &lt;i&gt;U. S. Term Limits,&lt;/i&gt; "the Framers understood the Elections Clause as a grant of authority to issue procedural regulations, and not as a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints." 514 U. S., at 833-834. Article VIII is not a procedural regulation. It does not regulate the time of elections; it does not regulate the place of elections; nor, we believe, does it regulate the manner of elections.&lt;sup&gt;[18]&lt;/sup&gt; As to the last point, Article VIII bears no relation to the "manner" of elections as we understand it, for in our commonsense view that term encompasses matters like "notices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*524&lt;/span&gt; practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and making and publication of election returns." &lt;i&gt;Smiley,&lt;/i&gt; 285 U. S., at 366; see also &lt;i&gt;U. S. Term Limits, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Thornton,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S., at 833. In short, Article VIII is not among "the numerous requirements as to procedure and safeguards which experience shows are necessary in order to enforce the fundamental right involved," &lt;i&gt;Smiley,&lt;/i&gt; 285 U. S., at 366, ensuring that elections are "fair and honest," and that "some sort of order, rather than chaos, is to accompany the democratic process," &lt;i&gt;Storer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Brown,&lt;/i&gt; 415 U. S. 724, 730 (1974).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, Article VIII is plainly designed to favor candidates who are willing to support the particular form of a term limits amendment set forth in its text and to disfavor those who either oppose term limits entirely or would prefer a different proposal. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Anderson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Celebrezze,&lt;/i&gt; 460 U. S. 780, 788, n. 9 (1983) ("We have upheld generally applicable and evenhanded [ballot access] restrictions that protect the integrity and reliability of the electoral process itself"). As noted, the state provision does not just "instruct" each member of Missouri's congressional delegation to promote in certain ways the passage of the specified term limits amendment. It also attaches a concrete consequence to noncompliance&#151;the printing of the statement "DISREGARDED VOTERS' INSTRUCTIONS ON TERM LIMITS" by the candidate's name on all primary and general election ballots. Likewise, a nonincumbent candidate who does not pledge to follow the instruction receives the ballot designation "DECLINED TO PLEDGE TO SUPPORT TERM LIMITS."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In describing the two labels, the courts below have employed terms such as "pejorative," "negative," "derogatory," "`intentionally intimidating,' " "particularly harmful," "politically damaging," "a serious sanction," "a penalty," and "official denunciation." 191 F. 3d, at 918, 919, 922, 925; 996 F. Supp., at 908; see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 910, 916. The general counsel to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*525&lt;/span&gt; petitioner's office, no less, has denominated the labels as "the Scarlet Letter." App. 34-35. We agree with the sense of these descriptions. They convey the substantial political risk the ballot labels impose on current and prospective congressional members who, for one reason or another, fail to comply with the conditions set forth in Article VIII for passing its term limits amendment. Although petitioner now claims that the labels "merely" inform Missouri voters about a candidate's compliance with Article VIII, she has acknowledged under oath that the ballot designations would handicap candidates for the United States Congress. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 66. To us, that is exactly the intended effect of Article VIII.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it seems clear that the adverse labels handicap candidates "at the most crucial stage in the election process&#151;the instant before the vote is cast." &lt;i&gt;Anderson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Martin,&lt;/i&gt; 375 U. S. 399, 402 (1964). At the same time, "by directing the citizen's attention to the single consideration" of the candidates' fidelity to term limits, the labels imply that the issue "is an important&#151;perhaps paramount&#151;consideration in the citizen's choice, which may decisively influence the citizen to cast his ballot" against candidates branded as unfaithful. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; While the precise damage the labels may exact on candidates is disputed between the parties, the labels surely place their targets at a political disadvantage to unmarked candidates for congressional office.&lt;sup&gt;[19]&lt;/sup&gt; Thus, far from &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*526&lt;/span&gt; regulating the procedural mechanisms of elections, Article VIII attempts to "dictate electoral outcomes." &lt;i&gt;U. S. Term Limits, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Thornton,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S., at 833-834. Such "regulation" of congressional elections simply is not authorized by the Elections Clause.&lt;sup&gt;[20]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*527&lt;/span&gt; Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Kennedy, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I join the opinion of the Court, holding &#167; 15 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; of Article VIII of the Missouri Constitution violative of the Constitution of the United States. It seems appropriate, however, to add these brief observations with respect to Part III of the opinion. The Court does not say the States are disabled from requesting specific action from Congress or from expressing their concerns to it. As the Court holds, however, the mechanism the State seeks to employ here goes well beyond this prerogative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A State is not permitted to interpose itself between the people and their National Government as it seeks to do here. Whether a State's concern is with the proposed enactment of a constitutional amendment or an ordinary federal statute it simply lacks the power to impose any conditions on the election of Senators and Representatives, save neutral provisions as to the time, place, and manner of elections pursuant to Article I, &#167; 4. As the Court observed in &lt;i&gt;U. S. Term Limits, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Thornton,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S. 779 (1995), the Elections Clause is a "grant of authority to issue procedural regulations," and not "a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 833-834. The Elections Clause thus delegates but limited power over federal elections to the States. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 804. The Court rules, as it must, that the amendments to Article VIII of the Missouri Constitution do not regulate the time or place of federal elections; rather, those provisions are an attempt to control the actions of the State's congressional delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*528&lt;/span&gt; The dispositive principle in this case is fundamental to the Constitution, to the idea of federalism, and to the theory of representative government. The principle is that Senators and Representatives in the National Government are responsible to the people who elect them, not to the States in which they reside. The Constitution was ratified by Conventions in the several States, not by the States themselves, U. S. Const., Art. VII, a historical fact and a constitutional imperative which underscore the proposition that the Constitution was ordained and established by the people of the United States. U. S. Const., preamble. The idea of federalism is that a National Legislature enacts laws which bind the people as individuals, not as citizens of a State; and, it follows, freedom is most secure if the people themselves, not the States as intermediaries, hold their federal legislators to account for the conduct of their office. If state enactments were allowed to condition or control certain actions of federal legislators, accountability would be blurred, with the legislators having the excuse of saying that they did not act in the exercise of their best judgment but simply in conformance with a state mandate. As noted in the concurring opinion in &lt;i&gt;Thornton,&lt;/i&gt; "[n]othing in the Constitution or The Federalist Papers . . . supports the idea of state interference with the most basic relation between the National Government and its citizens, the selection of legislative representatives." 514 U. S., at 842. Yet that is just what Missouri seeks to do through its law&#151;to wield the power granted to it by the Elections Clause to handicap those who seek federal office by affixing pejorative labels next to their names on the ballot if they do not pledge to support the State's preferred position on a certain issue. Neither the design of the Constitution nor sound principles of representative government are consistent with the right or power of a State to interfere with the direct line of accountability between the National Legislature and the people who elect it. For these reasons Article VIII is void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*529&lt;/span&gt; This said, it must be noted that when the Constitution was enacted, respectful petitions to legislators were an accepted mode of urging legislative action. See W. Miller, Arguing About Slavery 105-107 (1995). This right is preserved to individuals (the people) in the First Amendment. Even if a State, as an entity, is not itself protected by the Petition Clause, there is no principle prohibiting a state legislature from following a parallel course and by a memorial resolution requesting the Congress of the United States to pay heed to certain state concerns. From the earliest days of our Republic to the present time, States have done so in the context of federal legislation. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 22 Annals of Cong. 153-154 (1811) (reprinting a resolution by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania requesting that the charter of the Bank of the United States not be renewed); 2000 Ala. Acts 66 (requesting targeted relief for Medicare cuts); 2000 Kan. Sess. Laws, ch. 186 (urging Congress to allow state-inspected meat to be shipped in interstate commerce). Indeed, the situation was even more complex in the early days of our Nation, when Senators were appointed by state legislatures rather than directly elected. At that time, it appears that some state legislatures followed a practice of instructing the Senators whom they had appointed to pass legislation, while only requesting that the Representatives, who had been elected by the people, do so. See 22 Annals of Cong., at 153-154. I do not believe that the situation should be any different with respect to a proposed constitutional amendment, and indeed history bears this out. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 13 Annals of Cong. 95-96 (1803) (reprinting a resolution from the State of Vermont and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts requesting that Congress propose to the legislatures of the States a constitutional amendment akin to the Twelfth Amendment). The fact that the Members of the First Congress decided not to codify a right to instruct legislative representatives does not, in my view, prove that they &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*530&lt;/span&gt; intended to prohibit nonbinding petitions or memorials by the State as an entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are to be cases in which a close question exists regarding whether the State has exceeded its constitutional authority in attempting to influence congressional action, this case is not one of them. In today's case the question is not close. Here the State attempts to intrude upon the relationship between the people and their congressional delegates by seeking to control or confine the discretion of those delegates, and the interference is not permissible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these observations, I concur in the Court's opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Thomas, concurring in Parts I and IV and concurring in the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continue to believe that, because they possess "reserved" powers, "the people of the States need not point to any affirmative grant of power in the Constitution in order to prescribe qualifications for their representatives in Congress, or to authorize their elected state legislators to do so." &lt;i&gt;U. S. Term Limits, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Thornton,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S. 779, 846 (1995) (Thomas, J., dissenting). For this reason, I disagree with the Court's premise, derived from &lt;i&gt;U. S. Term Limits,&lt;/i&gt; that the States have no authority to regulate congressional elections except for the authority that the Constitution expressly delegates to them. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 522. Nonetheless, the parties conceded the validity of this premise, see Brief for Petitioner 25-26; Brief for Respondents 12-13, and I therefore concur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice O'Connor joins, concurring in the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, but on the ground that Missouri's Article VIII violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Specifically, I believe that Article VIII violates the First Amendment right of a political candidate, once lawfully on the ballot, to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*531&lt;/span&gt; have his name appear unaccompanied by pejorative language required by the State. Our ballot access cases based on First Amendment grounds have rarely distinguished between the rights of candidates and the rights of voters. In &lt;i&gt;Bullock&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Carter,&lt;/i&gt; 405 U. S. 134, 143 (1972), we said: "[T]he rights of voters and the rights of candidates do not lend themselves to neat separation; laws that affect candidates always have at least some theoretical, correlative effect on voters." And in &lt;i&gt;Anderson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Celebrezze,&lt;/i&gt; 460 U. S. 780, 787 (1983), we said that "voters can assert their preferences only through candidates or parties or both." Actions such as the present one challenging ballot provisions have in most instances been brought by the candidates themselves, and no one questions the standing of respondents Gralike and Harmon to raise a First Amendment challenge to such laws.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article I, &#167; 4, provides that "[t]he Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof . . . ." Missouri justifies Article VIII as a "time, place, and manner" regulation of election. Restrictions of this kind are valid "provided that they are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and that they leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information." &lt;i&gt;Clark&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Community for Creative Non-Violence,&lt;/i&gt; 468 U. S. 288, 293 (1984). Missouri's Article VIII flunks two of these three requirements. Article VIII is not only not content neutral, but it &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*532&lt;/span&gt; actually discriminates on the basis of viewpoint because only those candidates who fail to conform to the State's position receive derogatory labels. The result is that the State injects itself into the election process at an absolutely critical point&#151;the composition of the ballot, which is the last thing the voter sees before he makes his choice&#151;and does so in a way that is not neutral as to issues or candidates. The candidates who are thus singled out have no means of replying to their designation which would be equally effective with the voter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Anderson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Martin,&lt;/i&gt; 375 U. S. 399 (1964), we held that a Louisiana statute requiring the designation of a candidate's race on the ballot violated the Equal Protection Clause. In describing the effect of such a designation, the Court said: "[B]y directing the citizen's attention to the single consideration of race or color, the State indicates that a candidate's race or color is an important&#151;perhaps paramount&#151;consideration in the citizen's choice, which may decisively influence the citizen to cast his ballot along racial lines." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 402. So, too, here the State has chosen one and only one issue to comment on the position of the candidates. During the campaign, they may debate tax reform, Social Security, national security, and a host of other issues; but when it comes to the ballot on which one or the other of them is chosen, the State is saying that the issue of term limits is paramount. Although uttered in a different context, what we said in &lt;i&gt;Police Dept. of Chicago&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mosley,&lt;/i&gt; 408 U. S. 92, 96 (1972), is equally applicable here: "[Government] may not select which issues are worth discussing or debating."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If other Missouri officials feel strongly about the need for term limits, they are free to urge rejection of candidates who do not share their view and refuse to "take the pledge." Such candidates are able to respond to that sort of speech with speech of their own. But the State itself may not skew the ballot listings in this way without violating the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   Briefs of &lt;i&gt;amici curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal were filed for the State of Nebraska by &lt;i&gt;Don Stenberg,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;L.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kris W. Kobach, pro se,&lt;/i&gt; filed a brief as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  We shall follow the parties' practice of referring to the amendment as "Article VIII" even though it merely added new &#167;&#167; 15 through 22 to the pre-existing article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The full text of the proposed amendment is as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Congressional Term Limits Amendment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(a) No person shall serve in the office of United States Representative for more than three terms, but upon ratification of this amendment no person who has held the office of the United States Representative or who then holds the office shall serve for more than two additional terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(b) No person shall serve in the office of United States Senator for more than two terms, but upon ratification of this amendment no person who has held the office of United States Senator or who then holds the office shall serve in the office for more than one additional term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(c) Any state may enact by state constitutional amendment longer or shorter limits than those specified in section `a' or `b' herein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(d) This article shall have no time limit within which it must be ratified to become operative upon the ratification of the legislatures of threefourths of the several States."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Section 17(2) provides that the statement shall be printed "adjacent to the name of any United States Senator or Representative who:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(a) fails to vote in favor of the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above when brought to a vote or;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(b) fails to second the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above if it lacks for a second before any proceeding of the legislative body or;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(c) fails to propose or otherwise bring to a vote of the full legislative body the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above if it otherwise lacks a legislator who so proposes or brings to a vote of the full legislative body the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above or;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(d) fails to vote in favor of all votes bringing the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above before any committee or subcommittee of the respective house upon which he or she serves or;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(e) fails to reject any attempt to delay, table or otherwise prevent a vote by the full legislative body of the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above or;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(f) fails to vote against any proposed constitutional amendment that would establish longer term limits than those in the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above regardless of any other actions in support of the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above or;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(g) sponsors or cosponsors any proposed constitutional amendment or law that would increase term limits beyond those in the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above or;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(h) fails to ensure that all votes on Congressional Term Limits are recorded and made available to the public."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  The pledge, contained in &#167; 18(3), reads:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I support term limits and pledge to use all my legislative powers to enact the proposed Constitutional Amendment set forth in the Term Limits Act of 1996. If elected, I pledge to vote in such a way that the designation `DISREGARDED VOTERS' INSTRUCTION ON TERM LIMITS' will not appear adjacent to my name."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  Section 19(5) permits a voter to appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court a determination that a statement should not be placed next to a candidate's name, and &#167; 19(6) allows a candidate to appeal to the State's highest court a determination that such a statement should be printed. In either case, clear and convincing evidence is required to demonstrate that the statement does not belong on the ballot adjacent to the candidate's name.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remainder of Article VIII provides for automatic repeal of the Article should the specified Congressional Term Limits Amendment be ratified, &#167; 20; exclusive jurisdiction of challenges to the Amendment in the Supreme Court of Missouri, &#167; 21; and severance of "any portion, clause, or phrase" of Article VIII that is declared invalid, &#167; 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  Although Gralike intended to run for Congress when he filed suit, under Missouri law he could not formally file a declaration for candidacy until February 1998. App. 25-26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  See &lt;i&gt;League of Women Voters of Me.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gwadosky,&lt;/i&gt; 966 F. Supp. 52 (Me. 1997); &lt;i&gt;Donovan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Priest,&lt;/i&gt; 326 Ark. 353, 931 S. W. 2d 119 (1996).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  While the appeal was pending, respondent Gralike withdrew from the 1998 election and respondent Harmon, a nonincumbent candidate in the 2000 Republican congressional primary in the Seventh District of Missouri, intervened as an appellee. In view of Harmon's participation, there isno contention that this case is moot. See &lt;i&gt;Storer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Brown,&lt;/i&gt; 415 U. S. 724, 737, n. 8 (1974).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9]  Although Judge Hansen, dissenting in part, thought that &#167;&#167; 17 through 19 should be severed, leaving the rest of Article VIII intact, the majority declined to do so. 191 F. 3d, at 926, n. 12. Petitioner does not contend here that any parts of Article VIII should be severed if found unconstitutional, but rather urges us to uphold the provision "in its entirety."

&lt;p&gt;[14]  For example, the Provincial Congress of North Carolina passed the following instruction on April 12, 1776: "&lt;i&gt;Resolved,&lt;/i&gt; That the Delegates for this Colony in the Continental Congress be empowered to concur with the Delegates of the other Colonies in declaring Independency, and forming foreign alliances, reserving to this Colony the sole and exclusive right of forming a Constitution and Laws for this Colony . . . ." 5 American Archives 860 (P. Force ed. 1844).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[15]  Brief for Professor Kris W. Kobach as &lt;i&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 5, 13; see Brief for Petitioner 14, n. 13. But see 1 Annals of Cong. 744 (1789) (remarks of Rep. Wadsworth) ("I have known, myself, that [instructions] have been disobeyed, and yet the representative was not brought to account for it; on the contrary, he was caressed and re-elected, while those who have obeyed them, contrary to their private sentiments, have ever after been despised for it").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[16]  Of course, whether the members of a representative assembly should be bound by the views of their constituents, or by their own judgment, is a matter that has been the subject of debate since even before the Federal Union was established. For instance, in his classic speech to the electors of Bristol, Edmund Burke set forth the latter view:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To deliver an opinion is the right of all men; that of constituents is a weighty and respectable opinion, which a representative ought always to rejoice to hear; and which he ought always most seriously to consider. But authoritative instructions; mandates issued, which the member is bound blindly and implicitly to obey, to vote, and to argue for, though contrary to the clearest conviction of his judgment and conscience, these are things utterly unknown to the laws of this land, and which arise from a fundamental mistake of the whole order and tenor of our constitution." The Speeches of the Right Hon. Edmund Burke 130 (J. Burke ed. 1867).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[17]  Brief for Petitioner 28; see also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 38.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[18]  Petitioner once shared our belief, when, in deposition testimony before the District Court, she admitted that Article VIII does not regulate the time, place, or manner of elections. App. 58.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[19]  That much, apparently, also seemed clear to many Members of Congress operating under Article VIII or similar label laws adopted by other States, who consequently tailored their behavior to avoid the ballot designations. For example, in 1997, the House of Representatives voted on 11 different proposals to adopt a term limits amendment to the Constitution; 7 of those proposals were dictated by voter initiatives in 7 different States. Representative Blunt of Missouri introduced the Article VIII version to "ensure that members of the Missouri delegation have the ability to vote for language that meets a verbatim test of [the] Missouri Amendment" and thereby avoid "the scarlet letter provision." 143 Cong. Rec. H494 (Feb. 12, 1997). However, because each of the state initiatives provided a sanction similar to the ballot labels included in Article VIII, some Representatives explained that they were constrained to vote only for the version endorsed by the voters of their States, and to vote against differing versions proposed by congressional members from other States, even though they were supportive of term limits generally. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., id.,&lt;/i&gt; at H486 (remarks of Rep. Hutchinson) ("I will vote against the bill of the gentleman from Florida [Mr. McCollum], not because I am opposed to term limits but because this particular resolution does not comply with the term limit instructions approved by the voters and the people of Arkansas"); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at H490 (remarks of Rep. Crapo) ("Last Congress I supported the McCollum term limits bill that, as I said, supported a 12-year term limit. However, in this Congress I must oppose this bill because of the initiative passed by the people of the State of Idaho which requires me to oppose any term limits measure that does not have the same set of term limit conditions that are included in the initiative that was passed in the State"). As Representative Frank of Massachusetts put it, "[e]very State's Members get to vote on their State's term limits so they make them feel better and they do not get the scarlet letter." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at H487. Consequently, the most popular proposal for such an amendment, that of Representative McCollum of Florida, received 217 votes, 10 fewer than it had in the preceding Congress. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at H511. As for the Missouri version, it suffered a 353-to-72 defeat. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at H497.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[20]  At the margins, the parties have fought over whether the Elections Clause is even applicable because it is a grant of power to "each State by the Legislature thereof" and Article VIII is the product of referendum. Compare Brief for Petitioner 38, n. 46, with Brief for Respondents 12-13, n. 8. Of course, "[w]herever the term `legislature' is used in the Constitution, it is necessary to consider the nature of the particular action in view." &lt;i&gt;Smiley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Holm,&lt;/i&gt; 285 U. S. 355, 366 (1932). Nevertheless, we need not delve into this inquiry, as it is clear, for the reasons stated in the text, that Article VIII is not authorized by the Elections Clause.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In discussing the Elections Clause issue, respondents have also relied in part on First Amendment cases upholding "time, place, and manner" regulations of speech. Brief for Respondents 13-14. Although the Elections Clause uses the same phrase as that branch of our First Amendment jurisprudence, it by no means follows that such cases have any relevance to our disposition of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   The Court of Appeals upheld their First Amendment claim, but based its reasoning on the view that the ballot statements were "compelled speech" by the candidate, and therefore ran afoul of cases such as &lt;i&gt;Wooley&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Maynard,&lt;/i&gt; 430 U. S. 705 (1977). I do not agree with the reasoning of the Court of Appeals. I do not believe a reasonable voter, viewing the ballot labeled as Article VIII requires, would think that the candidate in question chose to characterize himself as having "disregarded voters' instructions" or as "having declined to pledge" to support term limits.&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

Collette.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Burt Neuborne&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondents in both cases. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Laura K. Abel, Kimani&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*536&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Paul-Emile, Paul K. Sonn, David S. Udell, Peter M. Fishbein,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Alan E. Rothman.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[&#134;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Kennedy, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1974, Congress enacted the Legal Services Corporation Act, 88 Stat. 378, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2996 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; The Act establishes the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) as a District of Columbia nonprofit corporation. LSC's mission is to distribute funds appropriated by Congress to eligible local grantee organizations "for the purpose of providing financial support for legal assistance in noncriminal proceedings or matters to persons financially unable to afford legal assistance." &#167; 2996b(a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSC grantees consist of hundreds of local organizations governed, in the typical case, by local boards of directors. In many instances the grantees are funded by a combination of LSC funds and other public or private sources. The grantee organizations hire and supervise lawyers to provide free legal assistance to indigent clients. Each year LSC appropriates funds to grantees or recipients that hire and supervise lawyers for various professional activities, including representation of indigent clients seeking welfare benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suit requires us to decide whether one of the conditions imposed by Congress on the use of LSC funds violates the First Amendment rights of LSC grantees and their clients. For purposes of our decision, the restriction, to be quoted in further detail, prohibits legal representation &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*537&lt;/span&gt; funded by recipients of LSC moneys if the representation involves an effort to amend or otherwise challenge existing welfare law. As interpreted by the LSC and by the Government, the restriction prevents an attorney from arguing to a court that a state statute conflicts with a federal statute or that either a state or federal statute by its terms or in its application is violative of the United States Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers employed by New York City LSC grantees, together with private LSC contributors, LSC indigent clients, and various state and local public officials whose governments contribute to LSC grantees, brought suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York to declare the restriction, among other provisions of the Act, invalid. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit approved an injunction against enforcement of the provision as an impermissible viewpoint-based discrimination in violation of the First Amendment, 164 F. 3d 757 (1999). We granted certiorari, and the parties who commenced the suit in the District Court are here as respondents. The LSC as petitioner is joined by the Government of the United States, which had intervened in the District Court. We agree that the restriction violates the First Amendment, and we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the inception of the LSC, Congress has placed restrictions on its use of funds. For instance, the LSC Act prohibits recipients from making available LSC funds, program personnel, or equipment to any political party, to any political campaign, or for use in "advocating or opposing any ballot measures." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2996e(d)(4). See &#167; 2996e(d)(3). The Act further proscribes use of funds in most criminal proceedings and in litigation involving nontherapeutic abortions, secondary school desegregation, military desertion, or violations of the Selective Service statute. &#167;&#167; 2996f(b)(8)&#151;(10) (1994 ed. and Supp. IV). Fund recipients &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*538&lt;/span&gt; are barred from bringing class-action suits unless express approval is obtained from LSC. &#167; 2996e(d)(5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restrictions at issue were part of a compromise set of restrictions enacted in the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (1996 Act), &#167; 504, 110 Stat. 1321-53, and continued in each subsequent annual appropriations Act. The relevant portion of &#167; 504(a)(16) prohibits funding of any organization&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"that initiates legal representation or participates in any other way, in litigation, lobbying, or rulemaking, involving an effort to reform a Federal or State welfare system, except that this paragraph shall not be construed to preclude a recipient from representing an individual eligible client who is seeking specific relief from a welfare agency if such relief does not involve an effort to amend or otherwise challenge existing law in effect on the date of the initiation of the representation."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prohibitions apply to all of the activities of an LSC grantee, including those paid for by non-LSC funds. &#167;&#167; 504(d)(1) and (2). We are concerned with the statutory provision which excludes LSC representation in cases which "involve an effort to amend or otherwise challenge existing law in effect on the date of the initiation of the representation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1997, LSC adopted final regulations clarifying &#167; 504(a)(16). 45 CFR pt. 1639 (1999). LSC interpreted the statutory provision to allow indigent clients to challenge welfare agency determinations of benefit ineligibility under interpretations of existing law. For example, an LSC grantee could represent a welfare claimant who argued that an agency made an erroneous factual determination or that an agency misread or misapplied a term contained in an existing welfare statute. According to LSC, a grantee in that position could argue as well that an agency policy violated existing law. &#167; 1639.4. Under LSC's interpretation, however, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*539&lt;/span&gt; grantees could not accept representations designed to change welfare laws, much less argue against the constitutionality or statutory validity of those laws. Brief for Petitioner in No. 99-603, p. 7. Even in cases where constitutional or statutory challenges became apparent after representation was well under way, LSC advised that its attorneys must withdraw. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the instant suit was filed in the District Court alleging the restrictions on the use of LSC funds violated the First Amendment, see 985 F. Supp. 323 (1997), the court denied a preliminary injunction, finding no probability of success on the merits. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 344.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. 164 F. 3d 757 (1999). As relevant for our purposes, the court addressed respondents' challenges to the restrictions in &#167; 504(a)(16). It concluded the section specified four categories of prohibited activities, of which "three appear[ed] to prohibit the type of activity named regardless of viewpoint, while one might be read to prohibit the activity only when it seeks reform." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 768. The court upheld the restrictions on litigation, lobbying, and rulemaking "involving an effort to reform a Federal or State welfare system," since all three prohibited grantees' involvement in these activities regardless of the side of the issue. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 768-769.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court next considered the exception to &#167; 504(a)(16) that allows representation of "`an individual eligible client who is seeking specific relief from a welfare agency.'" The court invalidated, as impermissible viewpoint discrimination, the qualification that representation could "not involve an effort to amend or otherwise challenge existing law," because it "clearly seeks to discourage challenges to the status quo." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 769-770.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left to decide what part of the 1996 Act to strike as invalid, the court concluded that congressional intent regarding severability was unclear. It decided to "invalidate the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*540&lt;/span&gt; smallest possible portion of the statute, excising only the viewpoint-based proviso rather than the entire exception of which it is a part." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 773.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dissenting in part, Judge Jacobs agreed with the majority except for its holding that the proviso banning challenges to existing welfare laws effected impermissible viewpointbased discrimination. The provision, in his view, was permissible because it merely defined the scope of services to be funded. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 773-778 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSC filed a petition for certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the &#167; 504(a)(16) suits-for-benefits proviso was unconstitutional. We granted certiorari, 529 U. S. 1052 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States and LSC rely on &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sullivan,&lt;/i&gt; 500 U. S. 173 (1991), as support for the LSC program restrictions. In &lt;i&gt;Rust,&lt;/i&gt; Congress established program clinics to provide subsidies for doctors to advise patients on a variety of family planning topics. Congress did not consider abortion to be within its family planning objectives, however, and it forbade doctors employed by the program from discussing abortion with their patients. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 179-180. Recipients of funds under Title X of the Public Health Service Act, &#167;&#167; 1002, 1008, as added, 84 Stat. 1506, 1508, 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 300a, 300a&#151;6, challenged the Act's restriction that provided that none of the Title X funds appropriated for family planning services could "be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning." &#167; 300a&#151;6. The recipients argued that the regulations constituted impermissible viewpoint discrimination favoring an antiabortion position over a proabortion approach in the sphere of family planning. 500 U. S., at 192. They asserted as well that Congress had imposed an unconstitutional condition on recipients of federal funds by requiring them to relinquish their right to engage &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*541&lt;/span&gt; in abortion advocacy and counseling in exchange for the subsidy. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 196.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We upheld the law, reasoning that Congress had not discriminated against viewpoints on abortion, but had "merely chosen to fund one activity to the exclusion of the other." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 193. The restrictions were considered necessary "to ensure that the limits of the federal program [were] observed." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Title X did not single out a particular idea for suppression because it was dangerous or disfavored; rather, Congress prohibited Title X doctors from counseling that was outside the scope of the project. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 194-195.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court in &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; did not place explicit reliance on the rationale that the counseling activities of the doctors under Title X amounted to governmental speech; when interpreting the holding in later cases, however, we have explained &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; on this understanding. We have said that viewpoint-based funding decisions can be sustained in instances in which the government is itself the speaker, see &lt;i&gt;Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Southworth,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S. 217, 229, 235 (2000), or instances, like &lt;i&gt;Rust,&lt;/i&gt; in which the government "used private speakers to transmit specific information pertaining to its own program." &lt;i&gt;Rosenberger&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,&lt;/i&gt; 515 U. S. 819, 833 (1995). As we said in &lt;i&gt;Rosenberger,&lt;/i&gt; "[w]hen the government disburses public funds to private entities to convey a governmental message, it may take legitimate and appropriate steps to ensure that its message is neither garbled nor distorted by the grantee." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; The latitude which may exist for restrictions on speech where the government's own message is being delivered flows in part from our observation that, "[w]hen the government speaks, for instance to promote its own policies or to advance a particular idea, it is, in the end, accountable to the electorate and the political process for its advocacy. If the citizenry objects, newly elected officials later could espouse some different or contrary &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*542&lt;/span&gt; position." &lt;i&gt;Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Southworth, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 235.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the latitude for government speech nor its rationale applies to subsidies for private speech in every instance, however. As we have pointed out, "[i]t does not follow . . . that viewpoint-based restrictions are proper when the [government] does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers." &lt;i&gt;Rosenberger, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 834.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the LSC program differs from the program at issue in &lt;i&gt;Rosenberger&lt;/i&gt; in that its purpose is not to "encourage a diversity of views," the salient point is that, like the program in &lt;i&gt;Rosenberger,&lt;/i&gt; the LSC program was designed to facilitate private speech, not to promote a governmental message. Congress funded LSC grantees to provide attorneys to represent the interests of indigent clients. In the specific context of &#167; 504(a)(16) suits for benefits, an LSC-funded attorney speaks on the behalf of the client in a claim against the government for welfare benefits. The lawyer is not the government's speaker. The attorney defending the decision to deny benefits will deliver the government's message in the litigation. The LSC lawyer, however, speaks on the behalf of his or her private, indigent client. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Polk County&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Dodson,&lt;/i&gt; 454 U. S. 312, 321-322 (1981) (holding that a public defender does not act "under color of state law" because he "works under canons of professional responsibility that mandate his exercise of independent judgment on behalf of the client" and because there is an "assumption that counsel will be free of state control").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government has designed this program to use the legal profession and the established Judiciary of the States and the Federal Government to accomplish its end of assisting welfare claimants in determination or receipt of their benefits. The advice from the attorney to the client and the advocacy by the attorney to the courts cannot be classified &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*543&lt;/span&gt; as governmental speech even under a generous understanding of the concept. In this vital respect this suit is distinguishable from &lt;i&gt;Rust.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private nature of the speech involved here, and the extent of LSC's regulation of private expression, are indicated further by the circumstance that the Government seeks to use an existing medium of expression and to control it, in a class of cases, in ways which distort its usual functioning. Where the government uses or attempts to regulate a particular medium, we have been informed by its accepted usage in determining whether a particular restriction on speech is necessary for the program's purposes and limitations. In &lt;i&gt;FCC&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;League of Women Voters of Cal.,&lt;/i&gt; 468 U. S. 364 (1984), the Court was instructed by its understanding of the dynamics of the broadcast industry in holding that prohibitions against editorializing by public radio networks were an impermissible restriction, even though the Government enacted the restriction to control the use of public funds. The First Amendment forbade the Government from using the forum in an unconventional way to suppress speech inherent in the nature of the medium. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 396-397. In &lt;i&gt;Arkansas Ed. Television Comm'n&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Forbes,&lt;/i&gt; 523 U. S. 666, 676 (1998), the dynamics of the broadcasting system gave station programmers the right to use editorial judgment to exclude certain speech so that the broadcast message could be more effective. And in &lt;i&gt;Rosenberger,&lt;/i&gt; the fact that student newspapers expressed many different points of view was an important foundation for the Court's decision to invalidate viewpoint-based restrictions. 515 U. S., at 836.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the government creates a limited forum for speech, certain restrictions may be necessary to define the limits and purposes of the program. &lt;i&gt;Perry Ed. Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Perry Local Educators' Assn.,&lt;/i&gt; 460 U. S. 37 (1983); see also &lt;i&gt;Lamb's Chapel&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Center Moriches Union Free School Dist.,&lt;/i&gt; 508 U. S. 384 (1993). The same is true when the government establishes a subsidy for specified ends. &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sullivan,&lt;/i&gt; 500 U. S. 173 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*544&lt;/span&gt; (1991). As this suit involves a subsidy, limited forum cases such as &lt;i&gt;Perry, Lamb's Chapel,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rosenberger&lt;/i&gt; may not be controlling in a strict sense, yet they do provide some instruction. Here the program presumes that private, nongovernmental speech is necessary, and a substantial restriction is placed upon that speech. At oral argument and in its briefs the LSC advised us that lawyers funded in the Government program may not undertake representation in suits for benefits if they must advise clients respecting the questionable validity of a statute which defines benefit eligibility and the payment structure. The limitation forecloses advice or legal assistance to question the validity of statutes under the Constitution of the United States. It extends further, it must be noted, so that state statutes inconsistent with federal law under the Supremacy Clause may be neither challenged nor questioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing subsidies to LSC, the Government seeks to facilitate suits for benefits by using the state and federal courts and the independent bar on which those courts depend for the proper performance of their duties and responsibilities. Restricting LSC attorneys in advising their clients and in presenting arguments and analyses to the courts distorts the legal system by altering the traditional role of the attorneys in much the same way broadcast systems or student publication networks were changed in the limited forum cases we have cited. Just as government in those cases could not elect to use a broadcasting network or a college publication structure in a regime which prohibits speech necessary to the proper functioning of those systems, see &lt;i&gt;Arkansas Ed. Television Comm'n, supra,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rosenberger, supra,&lt;/i&gt; it may not design a subsidy to effect this serious and fundamental restriction on advocacy of attorneys and the functioning of the judiciary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSC has advised us, furthermore, that upon determining a question of statutory validity is present in any anticipated or pending case or controversy, the LSC-funded attorney &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*545&lt;/span&gt; must cease the representation at once. This is true whether the validity issue becomes apparent during initial attorneyclient consultations or in the midst of litigation proceedings. A disturbing example of the restriction was discussed during oral argument before the Court. It is well understood that when there are two reasonable constructions for a statute, yet one raises a constitutional question, the Court should prefer the interpretation which avoids the constitutional issue. &lt;i&gt;Gomez&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 490 U. S. 858, 864 (1989); &lt;i&gt;Ashwander&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;TVA,&lt;/i&gt; 297 U. S. 288, 346-348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). Yet, as the LSC advised the Court, if, during litigation, a judge were to ask an LSC attorney whether there was a constitutional concern, the LSC attorney simply could not answer. Tr. of Oral Arg. 8-9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interpretation of the law and the Constitution is the primary mission of the judiciary when it acts within the sphere of its authority to resolve a case or controversy. &lt;i&gt;Marbury&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Madison,&lt;/i&gt; 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) ("It is emphatically the province and the duty of the judicial department to say what the law is"). An informed, independent judiciary presumes an informed, independent bar. Under &#167; 504(a)(16), however, cases would be presented by LSC attorneys who could not advise the courts of serious questions of statutory validity. The disability is inconsistent with the proposition that attorneys should present all the reasonable and well-grounded arguments necessary for proper resolution of the case. By seeking to prohibit the analysis of certain legal issues and to truncate presentation to the courts, the enactment under review prohibits speech and expression upon which courts must depend for the proper exercise of the judicial power. Congress cannot wrest the law from the Constitution which is its source. "Those then who controvert the principle that the constitution is to be considered, in court, as a paramount law, are reduced to the necessity of maintaining that courts must close their eyes on the constitution, and see only the law." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 178.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*546&lt;/span&gt; The restriction imposed by the statute here threatens severe impairment of the judicial function. Section 504(a)(16) sifts out cases presenting constitutional challenges in order to insulate the Government's laws from judicial inquiry. If the restriction on speech and legal advice were to stand, the result would be two tiers of cases. In cases where LSC counsel were attorneys of record, there would be lingering doubt whether the truncated representation had resulted in complete analysis of the case, full advice to the client, and proper presentation to the court. The courts and the public would come to question the adequacy and fairness of professional representations when the attorney, either consciously to comply with this statute or unconsciously to continue the representation despite the statute, avoided all reference to questions of statutory validity and constitutional authority. A scheme so inconsistent with accepted separation-of-powers principles is an insufficient basis to sustain or uphold the restriction on speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no answer to say the restriction on speech is harmless because, under LSC's interpretation of the Act, its attorneys can withdraw. This misses the point. The statute is an attempt to draw lines around the LSC program to exclude from litigation those arguments and theories Congress finds unacceptable but which by their nature are within the province of the courts to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restriction on speech is even more problematic because in cases where the attorney withdraws from a representation, the client is unlikely to find other counsel. The explicit premise for providing LSC attorneys is the necessity to make available representation "to persons financially unable to afford legal assistance." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2996(a)(3). There often will be no alternative source for the client to receive vital information respecting constitutional and statutory rights bearing upon claimed benefits. Thus, with respect to the litigation services Congress has funded, there is no alternative channel for expression of the advocacy Congress &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*547&lt;/span&gt; seeks to restrict. This is in stark contrast to &lt;i&gt;Rust.&lt;/i&gt;  There, a patient could receive the approved Title X family planning counseling funded by the Government and later could consult an affiliate or independent organization to receive abortion counseling. Unlike indigent clients who seek LSC representation, the patient in &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; was not required to forfeit the Government-funded advice when she also received abortion counseling through alternative channels. Because LSC attorneys must withdraw whenever a question of a welfare statute's validity arises, an individual could not obtain joint representation so that the constitutional challenge would be presented by a non-LSC attorney, and other, permitted, arguments advanced by LSC counsel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, LSC and the Government maintain that &#167; 504(a)(16) is necessary to define the scope and contours of the federal program, a condition that ensures funds can be spent for those cases most immediate to congressional concern. In support of this contention, they suggest the challenged limitation takes into account the nature of the grantees' activities and provides limited congressional funds for the provision of simple suits for benefits. In petitioners' view, the restriction operates neither to maintain the current welfare system nor insulate it from attack; rather, it helps the current welfare system function in a more efficient and fair manner by removing from the program complex challenges to existing welfare laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of the restriction, however, is to prohibit advice or argumentation that existing welfare laws are unconstitutional or unlawful. Congress cannot recast a condition on funding as a mere definition of its program in every case, lest the First Amendment be reduced to a simple semantic exercise. Here, notwithstanding Congress' purpose to confine and limit its program, the restriction operates to insulate current welfare laws from constitutional scrutiny and certain other legal challenges, a condition implicating central First Amendment concerns. In no lawsuit funded by the Government &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*548&lt;/span&gt; can the LSC attorney, speaking on behalf of a private client, challenge existing welfare laws. As a result, arguments by indigent clients that a welfare statute is unlawful or unconstitutional cannot be expressed in this Governmentfunded program for petitioning the courts, even though the program was created for litigation involving welfare benefits, and even though the ordinary course of litigation involves the expression of theories and postulates on both, or multiple, sides of an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is fundamental that the First Amendment "`was fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.'" &lt;i&gt;New York Times Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sullivan,&lt;/i&gt; 376 U. S. 254, 269 (1964) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Roth&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 354 U. S. 476, 484 (1957)). There can be little doubt that the LSC Act funds constitutionally protected expression; and in the context of this statute there is no programmatic message of the kind recognized in &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; and which sufficed there to allow the Government to specify the advice deemed necessary for its legitimate objectives. This serves to distinguish &#167; 504(a)(16) from any of the Title X program restrictions upheld in &lt;i&gt;Rust,&lt;/i&gt;  and to place it beyond any congressional funding condition approved in the past by this Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress was not required to fund an LSC attorney to represent indigent clients; and when it did so, it was not required to fund the whole range of legal representations or relationships. The LSC and the United States, however, in effect ask us to permit Congress to define the scope of the litigation it funds to exclude certain vital theories and ideas. The attempted restriction is designed to insulate the Government's interpretation of the Constitution from judicial challenge. The Constitution does not permit the Government to confine litigants and their attorneys in this manner. We must be vigilant when Congress imposes rules and conditions which in effect insulate its own laws from legitimate judicial challenge. Where private speech is involved, even &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*549&lt;/span&gt; Congress' antecedent funding decision cannot be aimed at the suppression of ideas thought inimical to the Government's own interest. &lt;i&gt;Regan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Taxation With Representation of Wash.,&lt;/i&gt; 461 U. S. 540, 548 (1983); &lt;i&gt;Speiser&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Randall,&lt;/i&gt;  357 U. S. 513, 519 (1958).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the reasons we have set forth, the funding condition is invalid. The Court of Appeals considered whether the language restricting LSC attorneys could be severed from the statute so that the remaining portions would remain operative. It reached the reasoned conclusion to invalidate the fragment of &#167; 504(a)(16) found contrary to the First Amendment, leaving the balance of the statute operative and in place. That determination was not discussed in the briefs of either party or otherwise contested here, and in the exercise of our discretion and prudential judgment we decline to address it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Court of Appeals is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 504(a)(16) of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (Appropriations Act) defines the scope of a federal spending program. It does not directly regulate speech, and it neither establishes a public forum nor discriminates on the basis of viewpoint. The Court agrees with all this, yet applies a novel and unsupportable interpretation of our public-forum precedents to declare &#167; 504(a)(16) facially unconstitutional. This holding not only has no foundation in our jurisprudence; it is flatly contradicted by a recent decision that is on all fours with the present cases. Having found the limitation upon the spending program unconstitutional, the Court then declines to consider the question of severability, allowing a judgment to stand that lets the program go forward under a version of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*550&lt;/span&gt; the statute Congress never enacted. I respectfully dissent from both aspects of the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974 (LSC Act), 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2996 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; is a federal subsidy program, the stated purpose of which is to "provid[e] financial support for legal assistance in noncriminal proceedings or matters to persons financially unable to afford legal assistance." &#167; 2996b(a). Congress, recognizing that the program could not serve its purpose unless it was "kept free from the influence of or use by it of political pressures," &#167; 2996(5), has from the program's inception tightly regulated the use of its funds. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt;  at 537-538. No Legal Services Corporation (LSC) funds may be used, for example, for "encouraging . . . labor or antilabor activities," &#167; 2996f(b)(6), for "litigation relating to the desegregation of any elementary or secondary school or school system," &#167; 2996f(b)(9), or for "litigation which seeks to procure a nontherapeutic abortion," &#167; 2996f(b)(8). Congress discovered through experience, however, that these restrictions did not exhaust the politically controversial uses to which LSC funds could be put.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, in 1996 Congress added new restrictions to the LSC Act and strengthened existing restrictions. Among the new restrictions is the one at issue here. Section 504(a)(16) of the Appropriations Act, 110 Stat. 1321-55 to 1321-56, withholds LSC funds from every entity that "participates in any . . . way . . . in litigation, lobbying, or rulemaking . . . involving an effort to reform a Federal or State welfare system." It thus bans LSC-funded entities from participating on either side of litigation involving such statutes, from participating in rulemaking relating to the implementation of such legislation, and from lobbying Congress itself regarding any proposed changes to such legislation. See 45 CFR &#167; 1639.3 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*551&lt;/span&gt; The restrictions relating to rulemaking and lobbying are superfluous; they duplicate general prohibitions on the use of LSC funds for those activities found elsewhere in the Appropriations Act. See &#167;&#167; 504(a)(2), (3), (4). The restriction on litigation, however, is unique, and it contains a proviso specifying what the restriction does not cover. Funding recipients may "represen[t] an individual eligible client who is seeking specific relief from a welfare agency if such relief does not involve an effort to amend or otherwise challenge existing law in effect on the date of the initiation of the representation." The LSC declares in its brief, and respondents do not deny, that under these provisions the LSC can sponsor neither challenges to &lt;i&gt;nor&lt;/i&gt; defenses of existing welfare reform law, Brief for Petitioner in No. 99-603, p. 29. The litigation ban is symmetrical: Litigants challenging the covered statutes or regulations do not receive LSC funding, and neither do litigants defending those laws against challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a suit for benefits raises a claim outside the scope of the LSC program, the LSC-funded lawyer may not participate in the suit. As the Court explains, if LSC-funded lawyers anticipate that a forbidden claim will arise in a prospective client's suit, they "may not undertake [the] representation," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 544. Likewise, if a forbidden claim arises unexpectedly at trial, "LSC-funded attorney[s] must cease the representation at once," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 544-545. See also Brief for Petitioner in No. 99-603, at 7, n. 4 (if the issue arises at trial, "the lawyer should discontinue the representation `consistent with the applicable rules of professional responsibility'"). The lawyers may, however, and indeed &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; explain to the client why they cannot represent him. See 164 F. 3d 757, 765 (CA2 1999). They are also free to express their views of the legality of the welfare law to the client, and they may refer the client to another attorney who can accept the representation, &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; See 985 F. Supp. 323, 335&#151; 336 (EDNY 1997).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*552&lt;/span&gt; II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LSC Act is a federal subsidy program, not a federal regulatory program, and "[t]here is a basic difference between [the two]." &lt;i&gt;Maher&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Roe,&lt;/i&gt; 432 U. S. 464, 475 (1977). Regulations directly restrict speech; subsidies do not. Subsidies, it is true, may &lt;i&gt;indirectly&lt;/i&gt; abridge speech, but only if the funding scheme is "`manipulated' to have a `coercive effect'" on those who do not hold the subsidized position. &lt;i&gt;National Endowment for Arts&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Finley,&lt;/i&gt; 524 U. S. 569, 587 (1998) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ragland,&lt;/i&gt;  481 U. S. 221, 237 (1987) (Scalia, J., dissenting)). Proving unconstitutional coercion is difficult enough when the spending program has universal coverage and excludes only certain speech&#151;such as a tax exemption scheme excluding lobbying expenses. The Court has found such programs unconstitutional only when the exclusion was "aimed at the suppression of dangerous ideas." &lt;i&gt;Speiser&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Randall,&lt;/i&gt; 357 U. S. 513, 519 (1958) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also &lt;i&gt;Regan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Taxation With Representation of Wash.,&lt;/i&gt; 461 U. S. 540, 550 (1983). Proving the requisite coercion is harder still when a spending program is not universal but limited, providing benefits to a restricted number of recipients, see &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sullivan,&lt;/i&gt; 500 U. S. 173, 194-195 (1991). The Court has found such selective spending unconstitutionally coercive only once, when the government created a public forum with the spending program but then discriminated in distributing funding within the forum on the basis of viewpoint. See &lt;i&gt;Rosenberger&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,&lt;/i&gt; 515 U. S. 819, 829-830 (1995). When the limited spending program does not create a public forum, proving coercion is virtually impossible, because simply denying a subsidy "does not `coerce' belief," &lt;i&gt;Lyng&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Automobile Workers,&lt;/i&gt; 485 U. S. 360, 369 (1988), and because the criterion of unconstitutionality is whether denial of the subsidy threatens "to drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace," &lt;i&gt;National Endowment for Arts&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Finley, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 587 (internal quotation &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*553&lt;/span&gt; marks omitted). Absent such a threat, "the Government may allocate . . . funding according to criteria that would be impermissible were direct regulation of speech or a criminal penalty at stake." 524 U. S., at 587-588.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sullivan, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; the Court applied these principles to a statutory scheme that is in all relevant respects indistinguishable from &#167; 504(a)(16). The statute in &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; authorized grants for the provision of family planning services, but provided that "[n]one of the funds . . . shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 178. Valid regulations implementing the statute required funding recipients to refer pregnant clients "for appropriate prenatal . . . services by furnishing a list of available providers that promote the welfare of mother and unborn child," but forbade them to refer a pregnant woman specifically to an abortion provider, even upon request. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 180. We rejected a First Amendment free-speech challenge to the funding scheme, explaining that "[t]he Government can, without violating the Constitution, selectively fund a program to encourage certain activities it believes to be in the public interest, without at the same time funding an alternative program which seeks to deal with the problem another way." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 193. This was not, we said, the type of "discriminat[ion] on the basis of viewpoint" that triggers strict scrutiny, &lt;i&gt;ibid.,&lt;/i&gt; because the "`decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right,'" &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; (quoting &lt;i&gt;Regan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Taxation With Representation of Wash., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 549).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true here. The LSC Act, like the scheme in &lt;i&gt;Rust,&lt;/i&gt; see 500 U. S., at 200, does not create a public forum. Far from encouraging a diversity of views, it has always, as the Court accurately states, "placed restrictions on its use of funds," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 537. Nor does &#167; 504(a)(16) discriminate on the basis of viewpoint, since it funds neither challenges to nor defenses of existing welfare law. The provision simply declines to subsidize a certain class of litigation, and under &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*554&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; that decision "does not infringe the right" to bring such litigation. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Ortwein&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Schwab,&lt;/i&gt; 410 U. S. 656, 658-660, and n. 5 (1973) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; (government not required by First Amendment or Due Process Clause to waive filing fee for welfare benefits litigation). The Court's repeated claims that &#167; 504(a)(16) "restricts" and "prohibits" speech, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 545, 546, and "insulates" laws from judicial review, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 547, are simply baseless. No litigant who, in the absence of LSC funding, would bring a suit challenging existing welfare law is deterred from doing so by &#167; 504(a)(16). &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; thus controls these cases and compels the conclusion that &#167; 504(a)(16) is constitutional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court contends that &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; is different because the program at issue subsidized government speech, while the LSC funds private speech. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 541-542. This is so unpersuasive it hardly needs response. If the private doctors' confidential advice to their patients at issue in &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; constituted "government speech," it is hard to imagine what subsidized speech would &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be government speech. Moreover, the majority's contention that the subsidized speech in these cases is not government speech because the lawyers have a professional obligation to represent the interests of their clients founders on the reality that the doctors in &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; had a professional obligation to serve the interests of their patients, see 500 U. S., at 214 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) ("ethical responsibilities of the medical profession")&#151;which at the time of &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; we had held to be highly relevant to the permissible scope of federal regulation, see &lt;i&gt;Thornburgh&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,&lt;/i&gt; 476 U. S. 747, 763 (1986) ("professional responsibilities" of physicians), overruled in part on other grounds, &lt;i&gt;Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Casey,&lt;/i&gt; 505 U. S. 833 (1992). Even respondents agree that "the true speaker in &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; was not the government, but a doctor." Brief for Respondents 19, n. 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court further asserts that these cases are different from &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; because the welfare funding restriction "seeks to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*555&lt;/span&gt; use an existing medium of expression and to control it . . . in ways which distort its usual functioning," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 543. This is wrong on both the facts and the law. It is wrong on the law because there is utterly no precedent for the novel and facially implausible proposition that the First Amendment has anything to do with government funding that&#151;though it does not actually abridge anyone's speech&#151;"distorts an existing medium of expression." None of the three cases cited by the Court mentions such an odd principle. In &lt;i&gt;Rosenberger&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.,&lt;/i&gt; the point critical to the Court's analysis was not, as the Court would have it, that it is part of the "usual functioning" of student newspapers to "expres[s] many different points of view," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 543 (it surely is not), but rather &lt;i&gt;that the spending program itself&lt;/i&gt; had been created "to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers," 515 U. S., at 834. What could not be distorted was &lt;i&gt;the public forum&lt;/i&gt; that the spending program had created. As for &lt;i&gt;Arkansas Ed. Television Comm'n&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Forbes,&lt;/i&gt; 523 U. S. 666 (1998), that case discussed the nature of television broadcasting, not to determine whether government regulation would alter its "usual functioning" and thus violate the First Amendment (no government regulation was even at issue in the case), but rather to determine whether state-owned television is a "public forum" under our First Amendment jurisprudence. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 673-674. And finally, the passage the Court cites from &lt;i&gt;FCC&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;League of Women Voters of Cal.,&lt;/i&gt; 468 U. S. 364, 396-397 (1984), says &lt;i&gt;nothing whatever&lt;/i&gt; about "using the forum [of public radio] in an unconventional way to suppress speech inherent in the nature of the medium," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 543. It discusses why the Government's asserted interest in "preventing [public radio] stations from becoming a privileged outlet for the political and ideological opinions of station owners and managers," 468 U. S., at 396 (internal quotation marks omitted), was insubstantial and thus could not justify the statute's restriction on editorializing. Even worse for the Court, after invalidating &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*556&lt;/span&gt; the restriction on this conventional First Amendment ground, &lt;i&gt;League of Women Voters&lt;/i&gt; goes on to say that "[o]f course," the restriction on editorializing "would plainly be valid" if"Congress were to adopt a revised version of [the statute] that permitted [public radio] stations to establish `affiliate' organizations which could then use the station's facilities to editorialize with nonfederal funds." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 400. But of course that is the case here. Regulations permit funding recipients to establish affiliate organizations to conduct litigation and other activities that fall outside the scope of the LSC program. See 45 CFR pt. 1610 (2000). Far from supporting the Court's nondistortion analysis, &lt;i&gt;League of Women Voters&lt;/i&gt; dooms the Court's case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court's "nondistortion" principle is also wrong on the facts, since there is no basis for believing that &#167; 504(a)(16), by causing "cases [to] be presented by LSC attorneys who [can]not advise the courts of serious questions of statutory validity," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 545, will distort the operation of the courts. It may well be that the bar of &#167; 504(a)(16) will cause LSCfunded attorneys to decline or to withdraw from cases that involve statutory validity. But that means at most that fewer statutory challenges to welfare laws will be presented to the courts because of the unavailability of free legal services for that purpose. So what? The same result would ensue from excluding LSC-funded lawyers from welfare litigation entirely. It is not the mandated, nondistortable function of the courts to inquire into all "serious questions of statutory validity" in all cases. Courts must consider only those questions of statutory validity &lt;i&gt;that are presented by litigants,&lt;/i&gt; and if the Government chooses not to subsidize the presentation of some such questions, that in no way "distorts" the courts' role. It is remarkable that a Court that has so studiously avoided deciding whether Congress could entirely eliminate federal &lt;i&gt;jurisdiction&lt;/i&gt; over certain matters, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Webster&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Doe,&lt;/i&gt; 486 U. S. 592, 603 (1988); &lt;i&gt;Bowen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Michigan Academy of Family Physicians,&lt;/i&gt; 476 U. S. 667, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*557&lt;/span&gt; 681, n. 12 (1986), would be so eager to hold the much lesser step of declining to subsidize the litigation unconstitutional under the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor will the judicial opinions produced by LSC cases systematically distort the interpretation of welfare laws. Judicial decisions do not stand as binding "precedent" for points that were not raised, not argued, and hence not analyzed. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Verdugo-Urquidez,&lt;/i&gt; 494 U. S. 259, 272 (1990); &lt;i&gt;Hagans&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lavine,&lt;/i&gt; 415 U. S. 528, 533, n. 5 (1974); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 344 U. S. 33, 37-38 (1952); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;More,&lt;/i&gt; 3 Cranch 159, 172 (1805) (Marshall, C. J.). The statutory validity that courts assume in LSC cases will remain open for full determination in later cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Court is troubled "because in cases where the attorney withdraws from a representation, the client is unlikely to find other counsel." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 546. That is surely irrelevant, since it leaves the welfare recipient in no &lt;i&gt;worse&lt;/i&gt;  condition than he would have been in had the LSC program never been enacted. Respondents properly concede that even if welfare claimants cannot obtain a lawyer anywhere else, the Government is not required to provide one. Brief for Respondents 16; accord, &lt;i&gt;Goldberg&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kelly,&lt;/i&gt; 397 U. S. 254, 270 (1970) (government not required to provide counsel at hearing regarding termination of welfare benefits). It is hard to see how providing free legal services to some welfare claimants (those whose claims do not challenge the applicable statutes) while not providing it to others is beyond the range of legitimate legislative choice. &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; rejected a similar argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Petitioners contend, however, that most Title X clients are effectively precluded by indigency and poverty from seeing a health-care provider who will provide abortion-related services. But once again, even these Title X clients are in no worse position than if Congress had never enacted Title X. The financial constraints &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*558&lt;/span&gt; that restrict an indigent woman's ability to enjoy the full range of constitutionally protected freedom of choice are the product not of governmental restrictions on access to abortion, but rather of her indigency." 500 U. S., at 203 (internal quotation marks omitted).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only conceivable argument that can be made for distinguishing &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; is that there even patients who wished to receive abortion counseling could receive the nonabortion services that the Government-funded clinic offered, whereas here some potential LSC clients who wish to receive representation on a benefits claim that does not challenge the statutes will be unable to do so because their cases raise a reform claim that an LSC lawyer may not present. This difference, of course, is required by the same ethical canons that the Court elsewhere does not wish to distort. Rather than sponsor "truncated representation," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 546, Congress chose to subsidize only those cases in which the attorneys it subsidized could work freely. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2996(6) ("[A]ttorneys providing legal assistance must have full freedom to protect the best interests of their clients"). And it is impossible to see how this difference from &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; has any bearing upon the First Amendment question, which, to repeat, is whether the funding scheme is "`manipulated' to have a `coercive effect'" on those who do not hold the subsidized position. &lt;i&gt;National Endowment for Arts&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Finley,&lt;/i&gt;  524 U. S., at 587 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ragland,&lt;/i&gt; 481 U. S., at 237 (Scalia, J., dissenting)). It could be claimed to have such an effect if the client in a case ineligible for LSC representation could eliminate the ineligibility by waiving the claim that the statute is invalid; but he cannot. No &lt;i&gt;conceivable&lt;/i&gt; coercive effect exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a very long discussion to make a point that is embarrassingly simple: The LSC subsidy neither prevents anyone from speaking nor coerces anyone to change speech, and is indistinguishable in all relevant respects from the subsidy &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*559&lt;/span&gt; upheld in &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sullivan, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; There is no legitimate basis for declaring &#167; 504(a)(16) facially unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even were I to accept the Court's First Amendment analysis, I could not join its decision to conclude this litigation without reaching the issue of severability. That issue, although decided by the Second Circuit, was not included within the question on which certiorari was granted, and, as the Court points out, was not briefed or argued here. I nonetheless think it an abuse of discretion to ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court has said that "[w]e may consider questions outside the scope of the limited order [granting certiorari] when resolution of those questions is necessary for the proper disposition of the case." &lt;i&gt;Piper Aircraft Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Reyno,&lt;/i&gt; 454 U. S. 235, 246-247, n. 12 (1981). I think it necessary to a "proper disposition" here because the statute concocted by the Court of Appeals bears little resemblance to what Congress enacted, funding without restriction welfare-benefits litigation that Congress funded only under the limitations of &#167; 504(a)(16). Although no party briefed severability in &lt;i&gt;Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;FCC,&lt;/i&gt;  518 U. S. 727 (1996), the Justices finding partial unconstitutionality considered it necessary to address the issue. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 767 (plurality opinion) ("[W]e must ask whether &#167; 10(a) is severable"); accord, &lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 505 U. S. 144, 186 (1992). I think we have that same obligation here. Moreover, by exercising our "discretion" to leave the severability question open, we fail to resolve the basic, real-world dispute at issue: whether LSC attorneys may represent welfare claimants who challenge the applicable welfare laws. Indeed, we leave the LSC program subject to even a greater uncertainty than the one we purport to have eliminated, since other circuits may conclude (as I do) that if the limitation upon welfare representation is unconstitutional, LSC attorneys cannot engage in welfare litigation at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*560&lt;/span&gt; "The inquiry into whether a statute is severable is essentially an inquiry into legislative intent." &lt;i&gt;Minnesota&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians,&lt;/i&gt; 526 U. S. 172, 191 (1999). If Congress "would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power, independently of that which is not," then courts must strike the provisions as a piece. &lt;i&gt;Alaska Airlines, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Brock,&lt;/i&gt; 480 U. S. 678, 684 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). One determines what Congress would have done by examining what it did. Perhaps the most that can be said on the subject is contained in a passage written by Chief Justice Shaw of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts that we have often quoted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[I]f [a statute's provisions] are so mutually connected with and dependent on each other, as conditions, considerations or compensations for each other, as to warrant a belief that the legislature intended them as a whole, and that, if all could not be carried into effect, the legislature would not pass the residue independently, and some parts are unconstitutional, all the provisions which as thus dependent, conditional or connected, must fall with them." &lt;i&gt;Warren&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mayor and Aldermen of&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Charlestown,&lt;/i&gt; 68 Mass. 84, 99 (1854).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear to me that the LSC Act's funding of welfare benefits suits and its prohibition on suits challenging or defending the validity of existing law are "conditions, considerations [and] compensations for each other" that cannot be severed. Congress through the LSC Act intended "to provide high quality legal assistance to those who would be otherwise unable to afford adequate legal counsel," 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2996(2), but only if the program could at the same time "be kept free from the influence of or use by it of political pressures," &#167; 2996(5). More than a dozen times in &#167; 504(a) Congress made the decision that certain activities could not be funded &lt;i&gt;at all&lt;/i&gt; without crippling the LSC program with political pressures. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; &#167; 504(a)(1) (reapportionment &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*561&lt;/span&gt; litigation); &#167; 504(a)(4) (local, state, and federal lobbying); &#167; 504(a)(7) (class-action lawsuits); &#167; 504(a)(12) (training programs for, &lt;i&gt;inter alia,&lt;/i&gt; boycotts, picketing, and demonstrations); &#167; 504(a)(14) (litigation with respect to abortion). The severability question here is, essentially, whether, without the restriction that the Court today invalidates, the permission for conducting welfare litigation would have been accorded. As far as appears from the best evidence (which is the structure of the statute), I think the answer must be no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have in some cases stated that when an "excepting proviso is found unconstitutional the substantive provisions which it qualifies cannot stand," for "to hold otherwise would be to extend the scope of the law . . . so as to embrace [situations] which the legislature passing the statute had, by its very terms, expressly excluded." &lt;i&gt;Frost&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Corporation Comm'n of Okla.,&lt;/i&gt; 278 U. S. 515, 525 (1929); see also &lt;i&gt;Davis&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Wallace,&lt;/i&gt; 257 U. S. 478, 484 (1922) ("Where an excepting provision in a statute is found unconstitutional, courts very generally hold that this does not work an enlargement of the scope or operation of other provisions with which that provision was enacted, and which it was intended to qualify or restrain"). I frankly doubt whether this approach has been followed consistently enough to be called the "general" rule, but if there were ever an instance in which it is appropriate it is here. To strike the restriction on welfare benefits suits is to void &#167; 504(a)(16) altogether. Subsection (a)(16) prohibits involvement in three types of activities with respect to welfare reform: lobbying, rulemaking, and litigation. But the proscriptions against using LSC funds to participate in welfare lobbying and rulemaking are superfluous, since as described above subsections (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4) of &#167; 504 withhold LSC funds from those activities generally. What is unique about subsection (a)(16)&#151;the only thing it achieves&#151;is its limit on litigation. To remove that limit is to repeal subsection (a)(16) altogether, and thus to eliminate a significant &lt;i&gt;quid pro quo&lt;/i&gt; of the legislative compromise. We &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*562&lt;/span&gt; have no authority to "rewrite [the] statute and give it an effect altogether different" from what Congress agreed to. &lt;i&gt;Railroad Retirement Bd.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Alton R. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 295 U. S. 330, 362 (1935) (quoted in &lt;i&gt;Carter&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Carter Coal Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 298 U. S. 238, 313 (1936)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is illuminating to speculate how these cases would have been decided if Congress had enacted &#167; 504(a)(16) without its proviso (prescribing only the general ban against "litigation, lobbying, or rulemaking, involving an effort to reform a Federal or State welfare system"), and if the positions of the parties before us here were reversed. If the LSC-funded lawyers were here arguing that the statute permitted representation of individual welfare claimants who did not challenge existing law, I venture to say that the Court would endorse their argument&#151;perhaps with stirring language about the importance of aid to welfare applicants and the Court's unwillingness to presume without clear indication that Congress would want to eliminate it. And I have little doubt that in that context the Court would find its current First Amendment musings as unpersuasive as I find them today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's decision is quite simply inexplicable on the basis of our prior law. The only difference between &lt;i&gt;Rust&lt;/i&gt; and the present cases is that the former involved "distortion" of (that is to say, refusal to subsidize) the normal work of doctors, and the latter involves "distortion" of (that is to say, refusal to subsidize) the normal work of lawyers. The Court's decision displays not only an improper special solicitude for our own profession; it also displays, I think, the very fondness for "reform through the courts"&#151;the making of innumerable social judgments through judge-pronounced constitutional imperatives&#151;that prompted Congress to restrict publicly funded litigation of this sort. The Court says today, through an unprecedented (and indeed previously rejected) interpretation of the First Amendment, that we will not allow this &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*563&lt;/span&gt; restriction&#151;and then, to add insult to injury, permits to stand a judgment that awards the general litigation funding that the statute does not contain. I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Decided February 27, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS OF MARYLAND
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*499&lt;/span&gt; Scalia, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Michael Gottesman&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Jonathan S. Massey, Kenneth J. Chesebro, Thomas V. Girardi, Thomas C. Goldstein, Walter J. Lack, Andrew W. Zepeda,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Steven L. Hogan.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*499&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Walter E. Dellinger&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Robert E. Willett, Francis B. Burch, Jr.,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Martin H. Redish.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Scalia, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case presents the question whether the claimpreclusive effect of a federal judgment dismissing a diversity action on statute-of-limitations grounds is determined by the law of the State in which the federal court sits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner filed a complaint against respondent in California state court, alleging inducement of breach of contract and various business torts. Respondent removed the case to the United States District Court for the Central District of California on the basis of diversity of citizenship, see 28 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 1332, 1441 (1994 ed. and Supp. IV), and successfully moved to dismiss petitioner's claims as barred by California's 2-year statute of limitations. In its order of dismissal, the District Court, adopting language suggested by respondent, dismissed petitioner's claims "in [their] entirety on the merits and with prejudice." App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a. Without contesting the District Court's designation of its dismissal as "on the merits," petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the District Court's order. 168 F. 3d 501 (1999) (table). Petitioner also brought suit against respondent in the State Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, alleging the same causes of action, which were not time barred under Maryland's 3-year statute of limitations. Respondent sought injunctive relief against this action from the California federal court under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1651, and removed the action to the United States District Court for the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*500&lt;/span&gt; District of Maryland on federal-question grounds (diversity grounds were not available because Lockheed "is a Maryland citizen," &lt;i&gt;Semtek Int'l, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lockheed Martin Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 988 F. Supp. 913, 914 (1997)). The California federal court denied the relief requested, and the Maryland federal court remanded the case to state court because the federal question arose only by way of defense, &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Following a hearing, the Maryland state court granted respondent's motion to dismiss on the ground of res judicata. Petitioner then returned to the California federal court and the Ninth Circuit, unsuccessfully moving both courts to amend the former's earlier order so as to indicate that the dismissal was not "on the merits." Petitioner also appealed the Maryland trial court's order of dismissal to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed, holding that, regardless of whether California would have accorded claim-preclusive effect to a statute-of-limitations dismissal by one of its own courts, the dismissal by the California federal court barred the complaint filed in Maryland, since the res judicata effect of federal diversity judgments is prescribed by federal law, under which the earlier dismissal was on the merits and claim preclusive. 128 Md. App. 39, 736 A. 2d 1104 (1999). After the Maryland Court of Appeals declined to review the case, we granted certiorari. 530 U. S. 1260 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner contends that the outcome of this case is controlled by &lt;i&gt;Dupasseur&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rochereau,&lt;/i&gt; 21 Wall. 130, 135 (1875), which held that the res judicata effect of a federal diversity judgment "is such as would belong to judgments of the State courts rendered under similar circumstances," and may not be accorded any "higher sanctity or effect." Since, petitioner argues, the dismissal of an action on statute-oflimitations grounds by a California state court would not be claim preclusive, it follows that the similar dismissal of this diversity action by the California federal court cannot be &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*501&lt;/span&gt; claim preclusive. While we agree that this would be the result demanded by &lt;i&gt;Dupasseur,&lt;/i&gt; the case is not dispositive because it was decided under the Conformity Act of 1872, 17 Stat. 196, which required federal courts to apply the procedural law of the forum State in nonequity cases. That arguably affected the outcome of the case. See &lt;i&gt;Dupasseur, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 135. See also Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 87, Comment &lt;i&gt;a,&lt;/i&gt; p. 315 (1980) (hereinafter Restatement) ("Since procedural law largely determines the matters that may be adjudicated in an action, state law had to be considered in ascertaining the effect of a federal judgment").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent, for its part, contends that the outcome of this case is controlled by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b), which provides as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Involuntary Dismissal: Effect Thereof. For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court, a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against the defendant. Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or for failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication upon the merits."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the dismissal here did not "otherwise specif[y]" (indeed, it specifically stated that it &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; "on the merits"), and did not pertain to the excepted subjects of jurisdiction, venue, or joinder, it follows, respondent contends, that the dismissal "is entitled to claim preclusive effect." Brief for Respondent 3-4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implicit in this reasoning is the unstated minor premise that all judgments denominated "on the merits" are entitled to claim-preclusive effect. That premise is not necessarily valid. The original connotation of an "on the merits" adjudication is one that actually "pass[es] directly on the substance &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*502&lt;/span&gt; of [a particular] claim" before the court. Restatement &#167; 19, Comment &lt;i&gt;a,&lt;/i&gt; at 161. That connotation remains common to every jurisdiction of which we are aware. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; ("The prototyp[ical] [judgment on the merits is] one in which the merits of [a party's] claim are in fact adjudicated [for or] against the [party] after trial of the substantive issues"). And it is, we think, the meaning intended in those many statements to the effect that a judgment "on the merits" triggers the doctrine of res judicata or claim preclusion. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Parklane Hosiery Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Shore,&lt;/i&gt; 439 U. S. 322, 326, n. 5 (1979) ("Under the doctrine of res judicata, a judgment on the merits in a prior suit bars a second suit involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action"); &lt;i&gt;Goddard&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Security Title Ins. &amp;amp; Guarantee Co.,&lt;/i&gt;  14 Cal. 2d 47, 51, 92 P. 2d 804, 806 (1939) ("[A] final judgment, rendered upon the merits by a court having jurisdiction of the cause . . . is a complete bar to a new suit between [the parties or their privies] on the same cause of action" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But over the years the meaning of the term "judgment on the merits" "has gradually undergone change," R. Marcus, M. Redish, &amp;amp; E. Sherman, Civil Procedure: A Modern Approach 1140-1141 (3d ed. 2000), and it has come to be applied to some judgments (such as the one involved here) that do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; pass upon the substantive merits of a claim and hence do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; (in many jurisdictions) entail claim-preclusive effect. Compare, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Western Coal &amp;amp; Mining Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jones,&lt;/i&gt; 27 Cal. 2d 819, 826, 167 P. 2d 719, 724 (1946), and &lt;i&gt;Koch&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rodlin Enterprises, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 223 Cal. App. 3d 1591, 1596, 273 Cal. Rptr. 438, 441 (1990), with &lt;i&gt;Plaut&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Spendthrift Farm, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S. 211, 228 (1995) (statute of limitations); &lt;i&gt;Goddard, supra,&lt;/i&gt;  at 50-51, 92 P. 2d, at 806-807, and &lt;i&gt;Allston&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Incorporated Village of Rockville Centre,&lt;/i&gt; 25 App. Div. 2d 545, 546, 267 N. Y. S. 2d 564, 565-566 (1966), with &lt;i&gt;Federated Department Stores, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Moitie,&lt;/i&gt; 452 U. S. 394, 399, n. 3 (1981) (demurrer or failure to state a claim). See also Restatement &#167; 19, Comment &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*503&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; and Reporter's Note; 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp;amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 4439, pp. 355&#151; 358 (1981) (hereinafter Wright &amp;amp; Miller). That is why the Restatement of Judgments has abandoned the use of the term&#151;"because of its possibly misleading connotations," Restatement &#167; 19, Comment &lt;i&gt;a,&lt;/i&gt; at 161.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, it is no longer true that a judgment "on the merits" is necessarily a judgment entitled to claim-preclusive effect; and there are a number of reasons for believing that the phrase "adjudication upon the merits" does not bear that meaning in Rule 41(b). To begin with, Rule 41(b) sets forth nothing more than a default rule for determining the import of a dismissal (a dismissal is "upon the merits," with the three stated exceptions, unless the court "otherwise specifies"). This would be a highly peculiar context in which to announce a federally prescribed rule on the complex question of claim preclusion, saying in effect, "All federal dismissals (with three specified exceptions) preclude suit elsewhere, unless the court otherwise specifies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even apart from the purely default character of Rule 41(b), it would be peculiar to find a rule governing the effect that must be accorded federal judgments by other courts ensconced in rules governing the internal procedures of the rendering court itself. Indeed, such a rule would arguably violate the jurisdictional limitation of the Rules Enabling Act: that the Rules "shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right," 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2072(b). Cf. &lt;i&gt;Ortiz&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fibreboard Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 527 U. S. 815, 842 (1999) (adopting a "limiting construction" of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1)(B) in order to "minimiz[e] potential conflict with the Rules Enabling Act, and [to] avoi[d] serious constitutional concerns"). In the present case, for example, if California law left petitioner free to sue on this claim in Maryland even after the California statute of limitations had expired, the federal court's extinguishment of that right (through Rule 41(b)'s &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*504&lt;/span&gt; mandated claim-preclusive effect of its judgment) would seem to violate this limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as so interpreted, the Rule would in many cases violate the federalism principle of &lt;i&gt;Erie R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tompkins,&lt;/i&gt;  304 U. S. 64, 78-80 (1938), by engendering "`substantial' variations [in outcomes] between state and federal litigation" which would "[l]ikely . . . influence the choice of a forum," &lt;i&gt;Hanna&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Plumer,&lt;/i&gt; 380 U. S. 460, 467-468 (1965). See also &lt;i&gt;Guaranty Trust Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;York,&lt;/i&gt; 326 U. S. 99, 108-110 (1945). Cf. &lt;i&gt;Walker&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Armco Steel Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 446 U. S. 740, 748-753 (1980). With regard to the claim-preclusion issue involved in the present case, for example, the traditional rule is that expiration of the applicable statute of limitations merely bars the remedy and does not extinguish the substantive right, so that dismissal on that ground does not have claimpreclusive effect in other jurisdictions with longer, unexpired limitations periods. See Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws &#167;&#167; 142(2), 143 (1969); Restatement of Judgments &#167; 49, Comment &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; (1942). Out-of-state defendants sued on stale claims in California and in other States adhering to this traditional rule would systematically remove state-law suits brought against them to federal court&#151;where, unless otherwise specified, a statute-of-limitations dismissal would bar suit everywhere.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if Rule 41(b) did mean what respondent suggests, we would surely have relied upon it in our cases recognizing the claim-preclusive effect of federal judgments in federalquestion cases. Yet for over half a century since the promulgation &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*505&lt;/span&gt; of Rule 41(b), we have not once done so. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Heck&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Humphrey,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S. 477, 488-489, n. 9 (1994); &lt;i&gt;Federated Department Stores, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Moitie, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 398; &lt;i&gt;Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;University of Ill. Foundation,&lt;/i&gt; 402 U. S. 313, 324, n. 12 (1971).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think the key to a more reasonable interpretation of the meaning of "operates as an adjudication upon the merits" in Rule 41(b) is to be found in Rule 41(a), which, in discussing the effect of voluntary dismissal by the plaintiff, makes clear that an "adjudication upon the merits" is the opposite of a "dismissal without prejudice":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Unless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits when filed by a plaintiff who has once dismissed in any court of the United States or of any state an action based on or including the same claim."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See also 18 Wright &amp;amp; Miller &#167; 4435, at 329, n. 4 ("Both parts of Rule 41 . . . use the phrase `without prejudice' as a contrast to adjudication on the merits"); 9 &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; &#167; 2373, at 396, n. 4 ("`[W]ith prejudice' is an acceptable form of shorthand for `an adjudication upon the merits' "). See also &lt;i&gt;Goddard,&lt;/i&gt; 14 Cal. 2d, at 54, 92 P. 2d, at 808 (stating that a dismissal "with prejudice" evinces "[t]he intention of the court to make [the dismissal] on the merits"). The primary meaning of "dismissal without prejudice," we think, is dismissal without barring the plaintiff from returning later, to the same court, with the same underlying claim. That will also ordinarily (though not always) have the consequence of not barring the claim from &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; courts, but its primary meaning relates to the dismissing court itself. Thus, Black's Law Dictionary (7th ed. 1999) defines "dismissed without prejudice" as "removed from the court's docket in such a way that the plaintiff may refile the same suit on the same claim," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 482, and defines "dismissal without prejudice" as "[a] dismissal that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*506&lt;/span&gt; does not bar the plaintiff from refiling the lawsuit within the applicable limitations period," &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think, then, that the effect of the "adjudication upon the merits" default provision of Rule 41(b)&#151;and, presumably, of the explicit order in the present case that used the language of that default provision&#151;is simply that, unlike a dismissal "without prejudice," the dismissal in the present case barred refiling of the same claim in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. That is undoubtedly a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient one, for claim-preclusive effect in other courts.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having concluded that the claim-preclusive effect, in Maryland, of this California federal diversity judgment is dictated neither by &lt;i&gt;Dupasseur&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rochereau&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; as petitioner contends, nor by Rule 41(b), as respondent contends, we turn to consideration of what determines the issue. Neither the Full Faith and Credit Clause, U. S. Const., Art. IV, &#167; 1,&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; nor the full faith and credit statute, 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1738,&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; addresses &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*507&lt;/span&gt; the question. By their terms they govern the effects to be given only to state-court judgments (and, in the case of the statute, to judgments by courts of territories and possessions). And no other federal textual provision, neither of the Constitution nor of any statute, addresses the claim-preclusive effect of a judgment in a federal diversity action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also true, however, that no federal textual provision addresses the claim-preclusive effect of a federal-court judgment in a federal-question case, yet we have long held that States cannot give those judgments merely whatever effect they would give their own judgments, but must accord them the effect that this Court prescribes. See &lt;i&gt;Stoll&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gottlieb,&lt;/i&gt;  305 U. S. 165, 171-172 (1938); &lt;i&gt;Gunter&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 200 U. S. 273, 290-291 (1906); &lt;i&gt;Deposit Bank&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Frankfort,&lt;/i&gt; 191 U. S. 499, 514-515 (1903). The reasoning of that line of cases suggests, moreover, that even when States are allowed to give federal judgments (notably, judgments in diversity cases) no more than the effect accorded to state judgments, that disposition is by direction of &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; Court, which has the last word on the claim-preclusive effect of &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt;  federal judgments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is true that for some purposes and within certain limits it is only required that the judgments of the courts of the United States shall be given the same force and effect as are given the judgments of the courts of the States wherein they are rendered; but it is equally true that whether a Federal judgment has been given due force and effect in the state court is a Federal question reviewable by this court, which will determine for itself whether such judgment has been given due weight or otherwise. . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When is the state court obliged to give to Federal judgments only the force and effect it gives to state court judgments within its own jurisdiction? Such cases are distinctly pointed out in the opinion of Mr. Justice &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*508&lt;/span&gt; Bradley in &lt;i&gt;Dupasseur&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rochereau&lt;/i&gt; [which stated that the case was a diversity case, applying state law under state procedure]." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, in &lt;i&gt;Dupasseur&lt;/i&gt; the State was allowed (indeed, required) to give a federal diversity judgment no more effect than it would accord one of its own judgments only because reference to state law was &lt;i&gt;the federal rule that this Court deemed appropriate.&lt;/i&gt; In short, federal common law governs the claim-preclusive effect of a dismissal by a federal court sitting in diversity. See generally R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, &amp;amp; D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 1473 (4th ed. 1996); Degnan, Federalized Res Judicata, 85 Yale L. J. 741 (1976).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is left to us, then, to determine the appropriate federal rule. And despite the sea change that has occurred in the background law since &lt;i&gt;Dupasseur&lt;/i&gt; was decided&#151;not only repeal of the Conformity Act but also the watershed decision of this Court in &lt;i&gt;Erie&lt;/i&gt; &#151;we think the result decreed by &lt;i&gt;Dupasseur&lt;/i&gt; continues to be correct for diversity cases. Since state, rather than federal, substantive law is at issue there is no need for a uniform federal rule. And indeed, nationwide uniformity in the substance of the matter is better served by having the same claim-preclusive rule (the state rule) apply whether the dismissal has been ordered by a state or a federal court. This is, it seems to us, a classic case for adopting, as the federally prescribed rule of decision, the law that would be applied by state courts in the State in which the federal diversity court sits. See &lt;i&gt;Gasperini&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Center for Humanities, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 518 U. S. 415, 429-431 (1996); &lt;i&gt;Walker&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Armco Steel Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 446 U. S., at 752-753; &lt;i&gt;Bernhardt&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Polygraphic Co. of America,&lt;/i&gt; 350 U. S. 198, 202&#151; 205 (1956); &lt;i&gt;Palmer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hoffman,&lt;/i&gt; 318 U. S. 109, 117 (1943); &lt;i&gt;Klaxon Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 313 U. S. 487, 496 (1941); &lt;i&gt;Cities Service Oil Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dunlap,&lt;/i&gt; 308 U. S. 208, 212 (1939). As we have alluded to above, any other rule would produce the sort of "forum-shopping . . . and . . . inequitable administration &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*509&lt;/span&gt; of the laws" that &lt;i&gt;Erie&lt;/i&gt; seeks to avoid, &lt;i&gt;Hanna,&lt;/i&gt;  380 U. S., at 468, since filing in, or removing to, federal court would be encouraged by the divergent effects that the litigants would anticipate from likely grounds of dismissal. See &lt;i&gt;Guaranty Trust Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;York,&lt;/i&gt; 326 U. S., at 109-110.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This federal reference to state law will not obtain, of course, in situations in which the state law is incompatible with federal interests. If, for example, state law did not accord claim-preclusive effect to dismissals for willful violation of discovery orders, federal courts' interest in the integrity of their own processes might justify a contrary federal rule. No such conflict with potential federal interests exists in the present case. Dismissal of this state cause of action was decreed by the California federal court only because the California statute of limitations so required; and there is no conceivable federal interest in giving that time bar more effect in other courts than the California courts themselves would impose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the claim-preclusive effect of the California federal court's dismissal "upon the merits" of petitioner's action on statute-of-limitations grounds is governed by a federal rule that in turn incorporates California's law of claim preclusion (the content of which we do not pass upon today), the Maryland Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that the dismissal necessarily precluded the bringing of this action in the Maryland courts. The judgment is reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   &lt;i&gt;Griffin B. Bell, Chilton Davis Varner, Paul D. Clement,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Jeffrey S. Bucholtz&lt;/i&gt; filed a brief for the Product Liability Advisory Council, Inc., as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging affirmance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Rule 41(b), interpreted as a preclusion-establishing rule, would not have the two effects described in the preceding paragraphs&#151;arguable violation of the Rules Enabling Act and incompatibility with &lt;i&gt;Erie R. Co.&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Tompkins,&lt;/i&gt; 304 U. S. 64 (1938)&#151;if the court's failure to specify an otherthan-on-the-merits dismissal were subject to reversal on appeal whenever it would alter the rule of claim preclusion applied by the State in which the federal court sits. No one suggests that this is the rule, and we are aware of no case that applies it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  We do not decide whether, in a diversity case, a federal court's "dismissal upon the merits" (in the sense we have described), under circumstances where a state court would decree only a "dismissal without prejudice," abridges a "substantive right" and thus exceeds the authorization of the Rules Enabling Act. We think the situation will present itself more rarely than would the arguable violation of the Act that would ensue from interpreting Rule 41(b) as a rule of claim preclusion; and if it is a violation, can be more easily dealt with on direct appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Article IV, &#167; 1, provides as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Title 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1738 provides in relevant part as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The records and judicial proceedings of any court of any . . . State, Territory or Possession . . . shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States and its Territories and Possessions as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State, Territory or Possession from which they are taken."&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*459&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*459&lt;/span&gt; Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, Parts I and IV of which were unanimous, Part II of which was joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Stevens, O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, and Ginsburg, JJ., and Part III of which was joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ. Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 486. Stevens, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which Souter, J., joined, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt;  p. 487. Breyer, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 490.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioners in No. 99-1257 and federal respondents in No. 99-1426.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*460&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Edward W. Warren&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for American Trucking Associations et al., respondents in No. 99-1257 and cross-petitioners in No. 99-1426. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Robert R.

Yuhnke&lt;/i&gt; filed a brief for Citizens for Balanced Transportation et al., respondents in No. 99-1426.&lt;sup&gt;[&#134;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*462&lt;/span&gt; Justice Scalia, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cases present the following questions: (1) Whether &#167; 109(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) delegates legislative power to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). (2) Whether the Administrator may consider the costs of implementation in setting national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) under &#167; 109(b)(1). (3) Whether the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to review the EPA's interpretation of Part D of Title I of the CAA, 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 7501-7515, with respect to implementing the revised ozone NAAQS. (4) If so, whether the EPA's interpretation of that part was permissible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 109(a) of the CAA, as added, 84 Stat. 1679, and amended, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7409(a), requires the Administrator of the EPA to promulgate NAAQS for each air pollutant for which "air quality criteria" have been issued under &#167; 108, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7408. Once a NAAQS has been promulgated, the Administrator must review the standard (and the criteria &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*463&lt;/span&gt; on which it is based) "at five-year intervals" and make "such revisions . . . as may be appropriate." CAA &#167; 109(d)(1), 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7409(d)(1). These cases arose when, on July 18, 1997, the Administrator revised the NAAQS for particulate matter and ozone. See NAAQS for Particulate Matter, 62 Fed. Reg. 38652 (codified in 40 CFR &#167; 50.7 (1999)); NAAQS for Ozone, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 38856 (codified in 40 CFR &#167;&#167; 50.9, 50.10 (1999)). American Trucking Associations, Inc., and its corespondents in No. 99-1257&#151;which include, in addition to other private companies, the States of Michigan, Ohio, and West Virginia&#151;challenged the new standards in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, pursuant to 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7607(b)(1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District of Columbia Circuit accepted some of the challenges and rejected others. It agreed with the No. 99&#151; 1257 respondents (hereinafter respondents) that &#167; 109(b)(1) delegated legislative power to the Administrator in contravention of the United States Constitution, Art. I, &#167; 1, because it found that the EPA had interpreted the statute to provide no "intelligible principle" to guide the agency's exercise of authority. &lt;i&gt;American Trucking Assns., Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;EPA,&lt;/i&gt;  175 F. 3d 1027, 1034 (1999). The court thought, however, that the EPA could perhaps avoid the unconstitutional delegation by adopting a restrictive construction of &#167; 109(b)(1), so instead of declaring the section unconstitutional the court remanded the NAAQS to the agency. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1038. (On this delegation point, Judge Tatel dissented, finding the statute constitutional as written. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1057.) On the second issue that the Court of Appeals addressed, it unanimously rejected respondents' argument that the court should depart from the rule of &lt;i&gt;Lead Industries Assn., Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;EPA,&lt;/i&gt; 647 F. 2d 1130, 1148 (CADC 1980), that the EPA may not consider the cost of implementing a NAAQS in setting the initial standard. It also rejected respondents' argument that the implementation provisions for ozone found in Part D, Subpart 2, of Title I of the CAA, 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 7511-7511f, were &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*464&lt;/span&gt; so tied to the existing ozone standard that the EPA lacked the power to revise the standard. The court held that although Subpart 2 constrained the agency's method of implementing the new standard, 175 F. 3d, at 1050, it did not prevent the EPA from revising the standard and designating areas of the country as "nonattainment areas," see 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7407(d)(1), by reference to it, 175 F. 3d, at 1047-1048. On the EPA's petition for rehearing, the panel adhered to its position on these points, and unanimously rejected the EPA's new argument that the court lacked jurisdiction to reach the implementation question because there had been no "final" implementation action. &lt;i&gt;American Trucking Assns., Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;EPA,&lt;/i&gt; 195 F. 3d 4 (CADC 1999). The Court of Appeals denied the EPA's suggestion for rehearing en banc, with five judges dissenting. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Administrator and the EPA petitioned this Court for review of the first, third, and fourth questions described in the first paragraph of this opinion. Respondents conditionally cross-petitioned for review of the second question. We granted certiorari on both petitions, 529 U. S. 1129 (2000); 530 U. S. 1202 (2000), and scheduled the cases for argument in tandem. We have now consolidated the cases for purposes of decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Lead Industries Assn., Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;EPA, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 1148, the District of Columbia Circuit held that "economic considerations [may] play no part in the promulgation of ambient air quality standards under Section 109" of the CAA. In the present cases, the court adhered to that holding, 175 F. 3d, at 1040-1041, as it had done on many other occasions. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;American Lung Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;EPA,&lt;/i&gt; 134 F. 3d 388, 389 (1998); &lt;i&gt;NRDC&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Administrator, EPA,&lt;/i&gt; 902 F. 2d 962, 973 (1990), vacated in part on other grounds, &lt;i&gt;NRDC&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;EPA,&lt;/i&gt; 921 F. 2d 326 (CADC 1991); &lt;i&gt;American Petroleum Institute&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Costle,&lt;/i&gt;  665 F. 2d 1176, 1185 (1981). Respondents argue that these &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*465&lt;/span&gt; decisions are incorrect. We disagree; and since the first step in assessing whether a statute delegates legislative power is to determine what authority the statute confers, we address that issue of interpretation first and reach respondents' constitutional arguments in Part III, &lt;i&gt;infra.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 109(b)(1) instructs the EPA to set primary ambient air quality standards "the attainment and maintenance of which . . . are requisite to protect the public health" with "an adequate margin of safety." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7409(b)(1). Were it not for the hundreds of pages of briefing respondents have submitted on the issue, one would have thought it fairly clear that this text does not permit the EPA to consider costs in setting the standards. The language, as one scholar has noted, "is absolute." D. Currie, Air Pollution: Federal Law and Analysis 4-15 (1981). The EPA, "based on" the information about health effects contained in the technical "criteria" documents compiled under &#167; 108(a)(2), 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7408(a)(2), is to identify the maximum airborne concentration of a pollutant that the public health can tolerate, decrease the concentration to provide an "adequate" margin of safety, and set the standard at that level. Nowhere are the costs of achieving such a standard made part of that initial calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this most natural of readings, respondents make a lengthy, spirited, but ultimately unsuccessful attack. They begin with the object of &#167; 109(b)(1)'s focus, the "public health." When the term first appeared in federal clean air legislation&#151;in the Act of July 14, 1955 (1955 Act), 69 Stat. 322, which expressed "recognition of the dangers to the public health" from air pollution&#151;its ordinary meaning was "[t]he health of the community." Webster's New International Dictionary 2005 (2d ed. 1950). Respondents argue, however, that &#167; 109(b)(1), as added by the Clean Air Amendments of 1970, 84 Stat. 1676, meant to use the term's secondary meaning: "[t]he ways and means of conserving the health &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*466&lt;/span&gt; of the members of a community, as by preventive medicine, organized care of the sick, etc." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Words that can have more than one meaning are given content, however, by their surroundings, &lt;i&gt;FDA&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Brown &amp;amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,&lt;/i&gt;  529 U. S. 120, 132-133 (2000); &lt;i&gt;Jones&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 527 U. S. 373, 389 (1999), and in the context of &#167; 109(b)(1) this second definition makes no sense. Congress could not have meant to instruct the Administrator to set NAAQS at a level "requisite to protect" "the art and science dealing with the protection and improvement of community health." Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1836 (1981). We therefore revert to the primary definition of the term: the health of the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, respondents argue, many more factors than air pollution affect public health. In particular, the economic cost of implementing a very stringent standard might produce health losses sufficient to offset the health gains achieved in cleaning the air&#151;for example, by closing down whole industries and thereby impoverishing the workers and consumers dependent upon those industries. That is unquestionably true, and Congress was unquestionably aware of it. Thus, Congress had commissioned in the Air Quality Act of 1967 (1967 Act) "a detailed estimate of the cost of carrying out the provisions of this Act; a comprehensive study of the cost of program implementation by affected units of government; and a comprehensive study of the economic impact of air quality standards on the Nation's industries, communities, and other contributing sources of pollution." &#167; 2, 81 Stat. 505. The 1970 Congress, armed with the results of this study, see The Cost of Clean Air, S. Doc. No. 91-40 (1969) (publishing the results of the study), not only anticipated that compliance costs could injure the public health, but provided for that precise exigency. Section 110(f)(1) of the CAA permitted the Administrator to waive the compliance deadline for stationary sources if, &lt;i&gt;inter&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*467&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;alia,&lt;/i&gt; sufficient control measures were simply unavailable and "the continued operation of such sources is &lt;i&gt;essential . . . to the public health&lt;/i&gt; or welfare." 84 Stat. 1683 (emphasis added). Other provisions explicitly permitted or required economic costs to be taken into account in implementing the air quality standards. Section 111(b)(1)(B), for example, commanded the Administrator to set "standards of performance" for certain new sources of emissions that as specified in &#167; 111(a)(1) were to "reflec[t] the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction which (taking into account the cost of achieving such reduction) the Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated." Section 202(a)(2) prescribed that emissions standards for automobiles could take effect only "after such period as the Administrator finds necessary to permit the development and application of the requisite technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within such period." 84 Stat. 1690. See also &#167; 202(b)(5)(C) (similar limitation for interim standards); &#167; 211(c)(2) (similar limitation for fuel additives); &#167; 231(b) (similar limitation for implementation of aircraft emission standards). Subsequent amendments to the CAA have added many more provisions directing, in explicit language, that the Administrator consider costs in performing various duties. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7545(k)(1) (reformulate gasoline to "require the greatest reduction in emissions . . . taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emissions reductions"); &#167; 7547(a)(3) (emission reduction for nonroad vehicles to be set "giving appropriate consideration to the cost" of the standards). We have therefore refused to find implicit in ambiguous sections of the CAA an authorization to consider costs that has elsewhere, and so often, been expressly granted. See &lt;i&gt;Union Elec. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;EPA,&lt;/i&gt; 427 U. S. 246, 257, and n. 5 (1976). Cf. &lt;i&gt;General Mo-&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;tors Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 496 U. S. 530, 538, 541 (1990) &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*468&lt;/span&gt; (refusing to infer in certain provisions of the CAA deadlines and enforcement limitations that had been expressly imposed elsewhere).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, to prevail in their present challenge, respondents must show a textual commitment of authority to the EPA to consider costs in setting NAAQS under &#167; 109(b)(1). And because &#167; 109(b)(1) and the NAAQS for which it provides are the engine that drives nearly all of Title I of the CAA, 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 7401-7515, that textual commitment must be a clear one. Congress, we have held, does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions&#151;it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes. See &lt;i&gt;MCI Telecommunications Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Telephone &amp;amp; Telegraph Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S. 218, 231 (1994); &lt;i&gt;FDA&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Brown &amp;amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 159-160. Respondents' textual arguments ultimately founder upon this principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their first claim is that &#167; 109(b)(1)'s terms "adequate margin" and "requisite" leave room to pad health effects with cost concerns. Just as we found it "highly unlikely that Congress would leave the determination of whether an industry will be entirely, or even substantially, rateregulated to agency discretion&#151;and even more unlikely that it would achieve that through such a subtle device as permission to `modify' rate-filing requirements," &lt;i&gt;MCI Telecommunications Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Telephone &amp;amp; Telegraph Co., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 231, so also we find it implausible that Congress would give to the EPA through these modest words the power to determine whether implementation costs should moderate national air quality standards. Accord, &lt;i&gt;Christensen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Harris County,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S. 576, 590, n. (2000) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("The implausibility of Congress's leaving a highly significant issue unaddressed (and thus `delegating' its resolution to the administering agency) is assuredly one of the factors &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*469&lt;/span&gt; to be considered in determining whether there is ambiguity" (emphasis deleted)).&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same defect inheres in respondents' next two arguments: that while the Administrator's judgment about what is requisite to protect the public health must be "based on [the] criteria" documents developed under &#167; 108(a)(2), see &#167; 109(b)(1), it need not be based &lt;i&gt;solely&lt;/i&gt; on those criteria; and that those criteria themselves, while they must include "effects on public health or welfare which may be expected from the presence of such pollutant in the ambient air," are not necessarily &lt;i&gt;limited&lt;/i&gt; to those effects. Even if we were to concede those premises, we still would not conclude that one of the unenumerated factors that the agency can consider in developing and applying the criteria is cost of implementation. That factor is &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; so indirectly related to public health &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; so full of potential for canceling the conclusions drawn from direct health effects that it would surely have been expressly mentioned in &#167;&#167; 108 and 109 had Congress meant it to be considered. Yet while those provisions describe in detail how the health effects of pollutants in the ambient air are to be calculated and given effect, see &#167; 108(a)(2), they say not a word about costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondents point, finally, to a number of provisions in the CAA that &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; require attainment cost data to be generated. Section 108(b)(1), for example, instructs the Administrator to "issue to the States," simultaneously with the criteria documents, "information on air pollution control techniques, which information shall include data relating to the cost of installation and operation." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7408(b)(l). And &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*470&lt;/span&gt; &#167; 109(d)(2)(C)(iv) requires the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee to "advise the Administrator of any adverse public health, welfare, social, economic, or energy effects which may result from various strategies for attainment and maintenance" of NAAQS.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7409(d)(2)(C)(iv). Respondents argue that these provisions make no sense unless costs are to be considered in setting the NAAQS. That is not so. These provisions enable the Administrator to assist the States in carrying out their statutory role as primary &lt;i&gt;implementers&lt;/i&gt; of the NAAQS. It is to the States that the CAA assigns initial and primary responsibility for deciding what emissions reductions will be required from which sources. See 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 7407(a), 7410 (giving States the duty of developing implementation plans). It would be impossible to perform that task intelligently without considering which abatement technologies are most efficient, and most economically feasible&#151;which is why we have said that "the most important forum for consideration of claims of economic and technological infeasibility is before the state agency formulating the implementation plan," &lt;i&gt;Union Elec. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;EPA,&lt;/i&gt; 427 U. S., at 266. Thus, federal clean air legislation has, from the very beginning, directed federal agencies to develop and transmit implementation data, including cost data, to the States. See 1955 Act, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*471&lt;/span&gt; &#167; 2(b), 69 Stat. 322; Clean Air Act of 1963, amending &#167;&#167; 3(a), (b) of the CAA, 77 Stat. 394; 1967 Act, &#167;&#167; 103(a)&#151;(d), 104, 107(c), 81 Stat. 486-488. That Congress chose to carry forward this research program to assist States in choosing the means through which they would implement the standards is perfectly sensible, and has no bearing upon whether cost considerations are to be taken into account in formulating the standards.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be clear from what we have said that the canon requiring texts to be so construed as to avoid serious constitutional problems has no application here. No matter how severe the constitutional doubt, courts may choose only between reasonably available interpretations of a text. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Miller&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;French,&lt;/i&gt; 530 U. S. 327, 341 (2000); &lt;i&gt;Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Yeskey,&lt;/i&gt; 524 U. S. 206, 212 (1998). The text of &#167; 109(b), interpreted in its statutory and historical context and with appreciation for its importance to the CAA as a whole, unambiguously bars cost considerations from the NAAQS-setting process, and thus ends the matter for us as well as the EPA.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*472&lt;/span&gt; III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 109(b)(1) of the CAA instructs the EPA to set "ambient air quality standards the attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the Administrator, based on [the] criteria [documents of &#167; 108] and allowing an adequate margin of safety, are requisite to protect the public health." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7409(b)(1). The Court of Appeals held that this section as interpreted by the Administrator did not provide an "intelligible principle" to guide the EPA's exercise of authority in setting NAAQS. "[The] EPA," it said, "lack[ed] any determinate criteria for drawing lines. It has failed to state intelligibly how much is too much." 175 F. 3d, at 1034. The court hence found that the EPA's interpretation (but not the statute itself) violated the nondelegation doctrine. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1038. We disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a delegation challenge, the constitutional question is whether the statute has delegated legislative power to the agency. Article I, &#167; 1, of the Constitution vests "[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted . . . in a Congress of the United States." This text permits no delegation of those powers, &lt;i&gt;Loving&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S. 748, 771 (1996); see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 776-777 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and so we repeatedly have said that when Congress confers decisionmaking authority upon agencies &lt;i&gt;Congress&lt;/i&gt; must "lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [act] is directed to conform." &lt;i&gt;J. W. Hampton, Jr., &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 276 U. S. 394, 409 (1928). We have never suggested that an agency can cure an unlawful delegation of legislative power by adopting in its discretion a limiting construction of the statute. Both &lt;i&gt;Fahey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mallonee,&lt;/i&gt; 332 U. S. 245, 252-253 (1947), and &lt;i&gt;Lichter&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 334 U. S. 742, 783 (1948), mention agency regulations in the course of their nondelegation discussions, but &lt;i&gt;Lichter&lt;/i&gt; did so because a subsequent Congress had incorporated the regulations into a revised version of the statute, &lt;i&gt;ibid.,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fahey&lt;/i&gt; because the customary &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*473&lt;/span&gt; practices in the area, implicitly incorporated into the statute, were reflected in the regulations, 332 U. S., at 250. The idea that an agency can cure an unconstitutionally standardless delegation of power by declining to exercise some of that power seems to us internally contradictory. The very choice of which portion of the power to exercise&#151;that is to say, the prescription of the standard that Congress had omitted&#151;would &lt;i&gt;itself&lt;/i&gt; be an exercise of the forbidden legislative authority. Whether the statute delegates legislative power is a question for the courts, and an agency's voluntary selfdenial has no bearing upon the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We agree with the Solicitor General that the text of &#167; 109(b)(1) of the CAA at a minimum requires that "[f]or a discrete set of pollutants and based on published air quality criteria that reflect the latest scientific knowledge, [the] EPA must establish uniform national standards at a level that is requisite to protect public health from the adverse effects of the pollutant in the ambient air." Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 99-1257, p. 5. Requisite, in turn, "mean[s] sufficient, but not more than necessary." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 7. These limits on the EPA's discretion are strikingly similar to the ones we approved in &lt;i&gt;Touby&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 500 U. S. 160 (1991), which permitted the Attorney General to designate a drug as a controlled substance for purposes of criminal drug enforcement if doing so was "`necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 163. They also resemble the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 provision requiring the agency to "`set the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer any impairment of health' "&#151;which the Court upheld in &lt;i&gt;Industrial Union Dept., AFL&#151;CIO&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Petroleum Institute,&lt;/i&gt; 448 U. S. 607, 646 (1980), and which even then-Justice Rehnquist, who alone in that case thought the statute violated the nondelegation doctrine, see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 671 (opinion concurring in judgment), would have upheld if, like the statute &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*474&lt;/span&gt; here, it did not permit economic costs to be considered. See &lt;i&gt;American Textile Mfrs. Institute, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Donovan,&lt;/i&gt; 452 U. S. 490, 545 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scope of discretion &#167; 109(b)(1) allows is in fact well within the outer limits of our nondelegation precedents. In the history of the Court we have found the requisite "intelligible principle" lacking in only two statutes, one of which provided literally no guidance for the exercise of discretion, and the other of which conferred authority to regulate the entire economy on the basis of no more precise a standard than stimulating the economy by assuring "fair competition." See &lt;i&gt;Panama Refining Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ryan,&lt;/i&gt; 293 U. S. 388 (1935); &lt;i&gt;A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt;  295 U. S. 495 (1935). We have, on the other hand, upheld the validity of &#167; 11(b)(2) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 821, which gave the Securities and Exchange Commission authority to modify the structure of holding company systems so as to ensure that they are not "unduly or unnecessarily complicate[d]" and do not "unfairly or inequitably distribute voting power among security holders." &lt;i&gt;American Power &amp;amp; Light Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;SEC,&lt;/i&gt; 329 U. S. 90, 104 (1946). We have approved the wartime conferral of agency power to fix the prices of commodities at a level that "`will be generally fair and equitable and will effectuate the [in some respects conflicting] purposes of th[e] Act.' " &lt;i&gt;Yakus&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 321 U. S. 414, 420, 423-426 (1944). And we have found an "intelligible principle" in various statutes authorizing regulation in the "public interest." See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;National Broadcasting Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 319 U. S. 190, 225-226 (1943) (Federal Communications Commission's power to regulate airwaves); &lt;i&gt;New York Central Securities Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 287 U. S. 12, 24-25 (1932) (Interstate Commerce Commission's power to approve railroad consolidations). In short, we have "almost never felt qualified to second-guess Congress regarding the permissible degree of policy judgment that can be left to those executing or applying &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*475&lt;/span&gt; the law." &lt;i&gt;Mistretta&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 488 U. S. 361, 416 (1989) (Scalia, J., dissenting); see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 373 (majority opinion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true enough that the degree of agency discretion that is acceptable varies according to the scope of the power congressionally conferred. See &lt;i&gt;Loving&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S., at 772-773; &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mazurie,&lt;/i&gt; 419 U. S. 544, 556-557 (1975). While Congress need not provide any direction to the EPA regarding the manner in which it is to define "country elevators," which are to be exempt from newstationary-source regulations governing grain elevators, see 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7411(i), it must provide substantial guidance on setting air standards that affect the entire national economy. But even in sweeping regulatory schemes we have never demanded, as the Court of Appeals did here, that statutes provide a "determinate criterion" for saying "how much [of the regulated harm] is too much." 175 F. 3d, at 1034. In &lt;i&gt;Touby,&lt;/i&gt; for example, we did not require the statute to decree how "imminent" was too imminent, or how "necessary" was necessary enough, or even&#151;most relevant here&#151;how "hazardous" was too hazardous. 500 U. S., at 165-167. Similarly, the statute at issue in &lt;i&gt;Lichter&lt;/i&gt; authorized agencies to recoup "excess profits" paid under wartime Government contracts, yet we did not insist that Congress specify how much profit was too much. 334 U. S., at 783-786. It is therefore not conclusive for delegation purposes that, as respondents argue, ozone and particulate matter are "nonthreshold" pollutants that inflict a continuum of adverse health effects at any airborne concentration greater than zero, and hence require the EPA to make judgments of degree. "[A] certain degree of discretion, and thus of lawmaking, inheres in most executive or judicial action." &lt;i&gt;Mistretta&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 417 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted); see 488 U. S., at 378-379 (majority opinion). Section 109(b)(1) of the CAA, which to repeat we interpret as requiring the EPA to set air quality standards at the level that is "requisite"&#151;that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*476&lt;/span&gt; is, not lower or higher than is necessary&#151;to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety, fits comfortably within the scope of discretion permitted by our precedent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals remanding for reinterpretation that would avoid a supposed delegation of legislative power. It will remain for the Court of Appeals&#151;on the remand that we direct for other reasons&#151;to dispose of any other preserved challenge to the NAAQS under the judicial-review provisions contained in 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7607(d)(9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final two issues on which we granted certiorari concern the EPA's authority to implement the revised ozone NAAQS in areas whose ozone levels currently exceed the maximum level permitted by that standard. The CAA designates such areas "nonattainment," &#167; 107(d)(1), 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7407(d)(1); see also Pub. L. 105-178, &#167; 6103, 112 Stat. 465 (setting timeline for new ozone designations), and it exposes them to additional restrictions over and above the implementation requirements imposed generally by &#167; 110 of the CAA. These additional restrictions are found in the five substantive subparts of Part D of Title I, 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 7501-7515. Subpart 1, &#167;&#167; 7501-7509a, contains general nonattainment regulations that pertain to every pollutant for which a NAAQS exists. Subparts 2 through 5, &#167;&#167; 7511&#151; 7514a, contain rules tailored to specific individual pollutants. Subpart 2, added by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, &#167; 103, 104 Stat. 2423, addresses ozone. 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 7511&#151; 7511f. The dispute before us here, in a nutshell, is whether Subpart 1 alone (as the agency determined), or rather Subpart 2 or some combination of Subparts 1 and 2, controls the implementation of the revised ozone NAAQS in nonattainment areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*477&lt;/span&gt; A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Administrator first urges, however, that we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals on this issue because it lacked jurisdiction to review the EPA's implementation policy. Section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7607(b)(1), gives the court jurisdiction over "any . . . nationally applicable regulations promulgated, or final action taken, by the Administrator," but the EPA argues that its implementation policy was not agency "action," was not "final" action, and is not ripe for review. We reject each of these three contentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time the EPA proposed the revised ozone NAAQS in 1996, it also proposed an "interim implementation policy" for the NAAQS, see 61 Fed. Reg. 65752 (1996), that was to govern until the details of implementation could be put in final form through specific "rulemaking actions." The preamble to this proposed policy declared that "the interim implementation policy . . . represent[s] EPA's preliminary views on these issues and, while it may include various statements that States must take certain actions, these statements are made pursuant to EPA's preliminary interpretations, and thus do not bind the States and public as a matter of law." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; If the EPA had done no more, we perhaps could accept its current claim that its action was not final. However, after the agency had accepted comments on its proposed policy, and on the same day that the final ozone NAAQS was promulgated, the White House published in the Federal Register what it titled a "Memorandum for the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency" that prescribed implementation procedures for the EPA to follow. 62 Fed. Reg. 38421 (1997). (For purposes of our analysis we shall assume that this memorandum was not itself action by the EPA.) The EPA supplemented this memorandum with an explanation of the implementation procedures, which it published in the explanatory preamble to its final ozone &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*478&lt;/span&gt; NAAQS under the heading, "Final decision on the primary standard." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 38873. "In light of comments received regarding the interpretation proposed in the Interim Implementation Policy," the EPA announced, it had "reconsidered that interpretation" and settled on a new one. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt;  The provisions of "subpart 1 of part D of Title I of the Act" will immediately "apply to the implementation of the new 8-hour [ozone] standards." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.;&lt;/i&gt; see also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 38885 (new standard to be implemented "simultaneously [with the old standard] . . . under the provisions of . . . subpart 1"). Moreover, the provisions of subpart 2 "will [also] continue to apply as a matter of law for so long as an area is not attaining the [old] 1-hour standard." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 38873. Once the area reaches attainment for the old standard, however, "the provisions of subpart 2 will have been achieved and those provisions will no longer apply." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.;&lt;/i&gt; see also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 38884-38885.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have little trouble concluding that this constitutes final agency action subject to review under &#167; 307. The bite in the phrase "final action" (which bears the same meaning in &#167; 307(b)(1) that it does under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. &#167; 704, see &lt;i&gt;Harrison&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;PPG Industries, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 446 U. S. 578, 586 (1980)), is not in the word "action," which is meant to cover comprehensively every manner in which an agency may exercise its power. See &lt;i&gt;FTC&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Standard Oil Co. of Cal.,&lt;/i&gt; 449 U. S. 232, 238, n. 7 (1980). It is rather in the word "final," which requires that the action under review "mark the consummation of the agency's decisionmaking process." &lt;i&gt;Bennett&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Spear,&lt;/i&gt; 520 U. S. 154, 177-178 (1997). Only if the "EPA has rendered its last word on the matter" in question, &lt;i&gt;Harrison&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;PPG Industries, Inc., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 586, is its action "final" and thus reviewable. That standard is satisfied here. The EPA's "decisionmaking process," which began with the 1996 proposal and continued with the reception of public comments, concluded &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*479&lt;/span&gt; when the agency, "in light of [these comments]," and in conjunction with a corresponding directive from the White House, adopted the interpretation of Part D at issue here. Since that interpretation issued, the EPA has refused in subsequent rulemakings to reconsider it, explaining to disappointed commenters that its earlier decision was conclusive. See 63 Fed. Reg. 31014, 31018-31019 (1998). Though the agency has not dressed its decision with the conventional procedural accoutrements of finality, its own behavior thus belies the claim that its interpretation is not final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision is also ripe for our review. "Ripeness `requir[es] us to evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.' " &lt;i&gt;Texas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 523 U. S. 296, 300-301 (1998) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Abbott Laboratories&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gardner,&lt;/i&gt; 387 U. S. 136, 149 (1967)). The question before us here is purely one of statutory interpretation that would not "benefit from further factual development of the issues presented." &lt;i&gt;Ohio Forestry Assn., Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sierra Club,&lt;/i&gt; 523 U. S. 726, 733 (1998). Nor will our review "inappropriately interfere with further administrative action," &lt;i&gt;ibid.,&lt;/i&gt; since the EPA has concluded its consideration of the implementation issue. Finally, as for hardship to the parties: The respondent States must&#151;on pain of forfeiting to the EPA control over implementation of the NAAQS&#151;promptly undertake the lengthy and expensive task of developing state implementation plans (SIP's) that will attain the new, more stringent standard within five years. See 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 7410, 7502. Whether or not this would suffice in an ordinary case brought under the review provisions of the APA, see 5 U. S. C. &#167; 704, we have characterized the special judicial-review provision of the CAA, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7607(b), as one of those statutes that specifically provides for "preenforcement" review, see &lt;i&gt;Ohio Forestry Assn., Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sierra Club, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 737. Such statutes, we have said, permit "judicial review directly, even before the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*480&lt;/span&gt; concrete effects normally required for APA review are felt." &lt;i&gt;Lujan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;National Wildlife Federation,&lt;/i&gt; 497 U. S. 871, 891 (1990). The effects at issue here surely meet that lower standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond all this, the implementation issue was fairly included within the challenges to the final ozone rule that were properly before the Court of Appeals. Respondents argued below that the EPA could not revise the ozone standard, because to do so would trigger the use of Subpart 1, which had been supplanted (for ozone) by the specific rules of Subpart 2. Brief for Industry Petitioners and Intervenors in No. 97-1441 (and consolidated cases) (CADC), pp. 32-34. The EPA responded that Subpart 2 did not supplant but simply supplemented Subpart 1, so that the latter section still "applies to all nonattainment areas for all NAAQS,. . . including nonattainment areas for any revised ozone standard." Final Brief for EPA in No. 97-1441 (and consolidated cases) (CADC), pp. 67-68. The agency later reiterated that Subpart 2 "does not supplant implementation provisions for revised ozone standards. This interpretation fully harmonizes Subpart 2 with EPA's clear authority to revise any NAAQS." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 71. In other words, the EPA was arguing that the revised standard could be issued, despite its apparent incompatibility with portions of Subpart 2, &lt;i&gt;because it would be implemented under Subpart 1 rather than Subpart 2.&lt;/i&gt; The District of Columbia Circuit ultimately agreed that Subpart 2 could be harmonized with the EPA's authority to promulgate revised NAAQS, but &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; because Subpart 2 is entirely inapplicable&#151;which is one of EPA's assignments of error. It is unreasonable to contend, as the EPA now does, that the Court of Appeals was obligated to reach the agency's preferred result, but forbidden to assess the reasons the EPA had given for reaching that result. The implementation issue was fairly included within respondents' challenge to the ozone rule, which all parties agree is final agency action ripe for review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*481&lt;/span&gt; B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our approach to the merits of the parties' dispute is the familiar one of &lt;i&gt;Chevron U. S. A. Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 837 (1984). If the statute resolves the question whether Subpart 1 or Subpart 2 (or some combination of the two) shall apply to revised ozone NAAQS, then "that is the end of the matter." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 842&#151; 843. But if the statute is "silent or ambiguous" with respect to the issue, then we must defer to a "reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 844. We cannot agree with the Court of Appeals that Subpart 2 clearly controls the implementation of revised ozone NAAQS, see 175 F. 3d, at 1048-1050, because we find the statute to some extent ambiguous. We conclude, however, that the agency's interpretation goes beyond the limits of what is ambiguous and contradicts what in our view is quite clear. We therefore hold the implementation policy unlawful. See &lt;i&gt;AT&amp;amp;T Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Iowa Utilities Bd.,&lt;/i&gt; 525 U. S. 366, 392 (1999).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text of Subpart 1 at first seems to point the way to a clear answer to the question, which Subpart controls? Two sections of Subpart 1, 7502(a)(1)(C) and 7502(a)(2)(D), contain switching provisions stating that if the classification of ozone nonattainment areas is "specifically provided [for] under other provisions of [Part D]," then those provisions will control instead of Subpart 1's. Thus, it is true but incomplete to note, as the Administrator does, that the substantive language of Subpart 1 is broad enough to apply to revised ozone standards. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; &#167; 7502(a)(1)(A) (instructing the Administrator to classify nonattainment areas according to "any revised standard, including a revision of any standard in effect on November 15, 1990"); &#167; 7502(a)(2)(A) (setting attainment deadlines). To determine whether that language &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; apply one must resolve the further textual issue whether some &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; provision, namely Subpart 2, provides for the classification of ozone nonattainment areas. If &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*482&lt;/span&gt; it does, then according to the switching provisions of Subpart 1 it will control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, does Subpart 2 provide for classifying nonattainment ozone areas under the revised standard? It unquestionably does. The backbone of the subpart is Table 1, printed in &#167; 7511(a)(1) and reproduced in the margin here,&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; which defines five categories of ozone nonattainment areas and prescribes attainment deadlines for each. Section 7511(a)(1) funnels all nonattainment areas into the table for classification, declaring that "[e]ach area designated nonattainment for ozone . . . shall be classified at the time of such designation, under table 1, by operation of law." And once an area has been classified, "the primary standard attainment date for ozone shall be as expeditiously as practicable but not later than the date provided in table 1." The EPA argues that this text is not as clear or comprehensive as it seems, because the title of &#167; 7511(a) reads "Classification and attainment dates for 1989 nonattainment areas," which suggests that Subpart 2 applies only to areas that were in nonattainment in 1989, and not to areas later designated nonattainment &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*483&lt;/span&gt; under a revised ozone standard. The suggestion must be rejected, however, because &#167; 7511(b)(1) specifically provides for the classification of areas that &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; in attainment in 1989 but have subsequently slipped into nonattainment. It thus makes clear that Subpart 2 is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; limited solely to 1989 nonattainment areas. This eliminates the interpretive role of the title, which may only "she[d] light on some ambiguous word or phrase in the statute itself," &lt;i&gt;Carter&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 530 U. S. 255, 267 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Yeskey,&lt;/i&gt; 524 U. S., at 212, in turn quoting &lt;i&gt;Trainmen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Baltimore &amp;amp; Ohio R. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 331 U. S. 519, 528-529 (1947)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may well be, as the EPA argues&#151;and as the concurring opinion below on denial of rehearing pointed out, see 195 F. 3d, at 11-12&#151;that some provisions of Subpart 2 are ill fitted to implementation of the revised standard. Using the old 1-hour averages of ozone levels, for example, as Subpart 2 requires, see &#167; 7511(a)(1); 44 Fed. Reg. 8202 (1979), would produce at best an inexact estimate of the new 8-hour averages, see 40 CFR &#167; 50.10, and App. I (1999). Also, to the extent that the new ozone standard is stricter than the old one, see Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 99-1257, p. 17 ("the stricter 8-hour NAAQS"); 62 Fed. Reg. 38856, 38858 (1997) (8-hour standard of 0.09 ppm rather than 0.08 ppm would have "generally represent[ed] the continuation of the [old] level of protection"), the classification system of Subpart 2 contains a gap, because it fails to classify areas whose ozone levels are greater than the new standard (and thus nonattaining) but less than the approximation of the old standard codified by Table 1. And finally, Subpart 2's method for calculating attainment dates&#151;which is simply to count forward a certain number of years from November 15, 1990 (the date the 1990 CAA Amendments took force), depending on how far out of attainment the area started&#151;seems to make no sense for areas that are first classified under a new standard after November 15, 1990. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*484&lt;/span&gt; If, for example, areas were classified in the year 2000, many of the deadlines would already have expired at the time of classification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These gaps in Subpart 2's scheme prevent us from concluding that Congress clearly intended Subpart 2 to be the exclusive, permanent means of enforcing a revised ozone standard in nonattainment areas. The statute is in our view ambiguous concerning the manner in which Subpart 1 and Subpart 2 interact with regard to revised ozone standards, and we would defer to the EPA's reasonable resolution of that ambiguity. See &lt;i&gt;FDA&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Brown &amp;amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S., at 132; &lt;i&gt;INS&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Aguirre-Aguirre,&lt;/i&gt; 526 U. S. 415, 424 (1999). We cannot defer, however, to the interpretation the EPA has given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever effect may be accorded the gaps in Subpart 2 as implying some limited applicability of Subpart 1, they cannot be thought to render Subpart 2's carefully designed restrictions on EPA discretion utterly nugatory once a new standard has been promulgated, as the EPA has concluded. The principal distinction between Subpart 1 and Subpart 2 is that the latter eliminates regulatory discretion that the former allowed. While Subpart 1 permits the EPA to establish classifications for nonattainment areas, Subpart 2 classifies areas as a matter of law based on a table. Compare &#167; 7502(a)(1) with &#167; 7511(a)(1) (Table 1). Whereas the EPA has discretion under Subpart 1 to extend attainment dates for as long as 12 years, under Subpart 2 it may grant no more than 2 years' extension. Compare &#167;&#167; 7502(a)(2)(A) and (C) with &#167; 7511(a)(5). Whereas Subpart 1 gives the EPA considerable discretion to shape nonattainment programs, Subpart 2 prescribes large parts of them by law. Compare &#167;&#167; 7502(c) and (d) with &#167; 7511a. Yet according to the EPA, Subpart 2 was simply Congress's "approach to the implementation of the [old] 1-hour" standard, and so there was no reason that "the new standard could not simultaneously be implemented under . . . subpart 1." 62 Fed. Reg. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*485&lt;/span&gt; 38856, 38885 (1997); see also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 38873 ("[T]he provisions of subpart 1 . . . would apply to the implementation of the new 8-hour ozone standards"). To use a few apparent gaps in Subpart 2 to render its textually explicit applicability to nonattainment areas under the new standard utterly inoperative is to go over the edge of reasonable interpretation. The EPA may not construe the statute in a way that completely nullifies textually applicable provisions meant to limit its discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPA's interpretation making Subpart 2 abruptly obsolete is all the more astonishing because Subpart 2 was obviously written to govern implementation for some time. Some of the elements required to be included in SIP's under Subpart 2 were not to take effect until many years after the passage of the CAA. See &#167; 7511a(e)(3) (restrictions on "electric utility and industrial and commercial boiler[s]" to be "effective 8 years after November 15, 1990"); &#167; 7511a(c)(5)(A) (vehicle monitoring program to "[b]egi[n] 6 years after November 15, 1990"); &#167; 7511a(g)(1) (emissions milestone requirements to be applied "6 years after November 15, 1990, and at intervals of every 3 years thereafter"). A plan reaching so far into the future was not enacted to be abandoned the next time the EPA reviewed the ozone standard&#151;which Congress knew could happen at any time, since the technical staff papers had already been completed in late 1989. See 58 Fed. Reg. 13008, 13010 (1993); see also 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7409(d)(1) (NAAQS must be reviewed and, if appropriate, revised at least once every five years). Yet nothing in the EPA's interpretation would have prevented the agency from aborting Subpart 2 the day after it was enacted. Even now, if the EPA's interpretation were correct, some areas of the country could be required to meet the new, more stringent ozone standard in &lt;i&gt;at most&lt;/i&gt; the same time that Subpart 2 had allowed them to meet the old standard. Compare &#167; 7502(a)(2) (Subpart 1 attainment dates) with &#167; 7511(a) (Subpart 2 attainment dates). Los Angeles, for instance, "would &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*486&lt;/span&gt; be required to attain the revised NAAQS under Subpart 1 no later than the same year that marks the outer time limit for attaining Subpart 2's one-hour ozone standard." Brief for Petitioners in No. 99-1257, p. 49. An interpretation of Subpart 2 so at odds with its structure and manifest purpose cannot be sustained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We therefore find the EPA's implementation policy to be unlawful, though not in the precise respect determined by the Court of Appeals. After our remand, and the Court of Appeals' final disposition of these cases, it is left to the EPA to develop a reasonable interpretation of the nonattainment implementation provisions insofar as they apply to revised ozone NAAQS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize our holdings in these unusually complex cases: (1) The EPA may not consider implementation costs in setting primary and secondary NAAQS under &#167; 109(b) of the CAA. (2) Section 109(b)(1) does not delegate legislative power to the EPA in contravention of Art. I, &#167; 1, of the Constitution. (3) The Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to review the EPA's interpretation of Part D of Title I of the CAA, relating to the implementation of the revised ozone NAAQS. (4) The EPA's interpretation of that Part is unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cases are remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Thomas, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with the majority that &#167; 109's directive to the agency is no less an "intelligible principle" than a host of other directives that we have approved. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 474-476. I also agree that the Court of Appeals' remand to the agency to make its own corrective interpretation does not accord with our understanding of the delegation issue. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 472-473. I write separately, however, to express my concern &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*487&lt;/span&gt; that there may nevertheless be a genuine constitutional problem with &#167; 109, a problem which the parties did not address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parties to these cases who briefed the constitutional issue wrangled over constitutional doctrine with barely a nod to the text of the Constitution. Although this Court since 1928 has treated the "intelligible principle" requirement as the only constitutional limit on congressional grants of power to administrative agencies, see &lt;i&gt;J. W. Hampton, Jr., &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 276 U. S. 394, 409 (1928), the Constitution does not speak of "intelligible principles." Rather, it speaks in much simpler terms: "&lt;i&gt;All&lt;/i&gt; legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress." U. S. Const., Art. 1, &#167; 1 (emphasis added). I am not convinced that the intelligible principle doctrine serves to prevent all cessions of legislative power. I believe that there are cases in which the principle is intelligible and yet the significance of the delegated decision is simply too great for the decision to be called anything other than "legislative."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is, none of the parties to these cases has examined the text of the Constitution or asked us to reconsider our precedents on cessions of legislative power. On a future day, however, I would be willing to address the question whether our delegation jurisprudence has strayed too far from our Founders' understanding of separation of powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 109(b)(1) delegates to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to promulgate national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). In Part III of its opinion, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 472-476, the Court convincingly explains why the Court of Appeals erred when it concluded that &#167; 109 effected "an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power." &lt;i&gt;American Trucking Assns., Inc.&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;EPA,&lt;/i&gt; 175 F. 3d 1027, 1033 (CADC 1999) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*488&lt;/span&gt; I wholeheartedly endorse the Court's result and endorse its explanation of its reasons, albeit with the following caveat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court has two choices. We could choose to articulate our ultimate disposition of this issue by frankly acknowledging that the power delegated to the EPA is "legislative" but nevertheless conclude that the delegation is constitutional because adequately limited by the terms of the authorizing statute. Alternatively, we could pretend, as the Court does, that the authority delegated to the EPA is somehow not "legislative power." Despite the fact that there is language in our opinions that supports the Court's articulation of our holding,&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; I am persuaded that it would be both wiser and more faithful to what we have actually done in delegation cases to admit that agency rulemaking authority is "legislative power."&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proper characterization of governmental power should generally depend on the nature of the power, not on the identity of the person exercising it. See Black's Law Dictionary 899 (6th ed. 1990) (defining "legislation" as, &lt;i&gt;inter alia,&lt;/i&gt; "[f]ormulation of rule[s] for the future"); 1 K. Davis &amp;amp; R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise &#167; 2.3, p. 37 (3d ed. 1994) ("If legislative power means the power to make rules of conduct that bind everyone based on resolution of major policy issues, scores of agencies exercise legislative power routinely by &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*489&lt;/span&gt; promulgating what are candidly called `legislative rules' "). If the NAAQS that the EPA promulgated had been prescribed by Congress, everyone would agree that those rules would be the product of an exercise of "legislative power." The same characterization is appropriate when an agency exercises rulemaking authority pursuant to a permissible delegation from Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My view is not only more faithful to normal English usage, but is also fully consistent with the text of the Constitution. In Article I, the Framers vested "All legislative Powers" in the Congress, Art. I, &#167; 1, just as in Article II they vested the "executive Power" in the President, Art. II, &#167; 1. Those provisions do not purport to limit the authority of either recipient of power to delegate authority to others. See &lt;i&gt;Bowsher&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Synar,&lt;/i&gt; 478 U. S. 714, 752 (1986) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment) ("Despite the statement in Article I of the Constitution that `All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States,' it is far from novel to acknowledge that independent agencies do indeed exercise legislative powers"); &lt;i&gt;INS&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chadha,&lt;/i&gt; 462 U. S. 919, 985-986 (1983) (White, J., dissenting) ("[L]egislative power can be exercised by independent agencies and Executive departments . . ."); 1 Davis &amp;amp; Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise &#167; 2.6, at 66 ("The Court was probably mistaken from the outset in interpreting Article I's grant of power to Congress as an implicit limit on Congress' authority to delegate legislative power"). Surely the authority granted to members of the Cabinet and federal law enforcement agents is properly characterized as "Executive" even though not exercised by the President. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Morrison&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Olson,&lt;/i&gt; 487 U. S. 654, 705-706 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (arguing that the independent counsel exercised "executive power" unconstrained by the President).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems clear that an executive agency's exercise of rulemaking authority pursuant to a valid delegation from Congress is "legislative." As long as the delegation provides a &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*490&lt;/span&gt; sufficiently intelligible principle, there is nothing inherently unconstitutional about it. Accordingly, while I join Parts I, II, and IV of the Court's opinion, and agree with almost everything said in Part III, I would hold that when Congress enacted &#167; 109, it effected a constitutional delegation of legislative power to the EPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Breyer, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I join Parts I, III, and IV of the Court's opinion. I also agree with the Court's determination in Part II that the Clean Air Act does not permit the Environmental Protection Agency to consider the economic costs of implementation when setting national ambient air quality standards under &#167; 109(b)(1) of the Act. But I would not rest this conclusion solely upon &#167; 109's language or upon a presumption, such as the Court's presumption that any authority the Act grants the EPA to consider costs must flow from a "textual commitment" that is "clear." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 468. In order better to achieve regulatory goals&#151;for example, to allocate resources so that they save more lives or produce a cleaner environment&#151;regulators must often take account of all of a proposed regulation's adverse effects, at least where those adverse effects clearly threaten serious and disproportionate public harm. Hence, I believe that, other things being equal, we should read silences or ambiguities in the language of regulatory statutes as permitting, not forbidding, this type of rational regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these cases, however, other things are not equal. Here, legislative history, along with the statute's structure, indicates that &#167; 109's language reflects a congressional decision not to delegate to the agency the legal authority to consider economic costs of compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, the legislative history shows that Congress intended the statute to be "technology forcing." Senator Edmund Muskie, the primary sponsor of the 1970 amendments &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*491&lt;/span&gt; to the Act, introduced them by saying that Congress' primary responsibility in drafting the Act was not "to be limited by what is or appears to be technologically or economically feasible," but "to establish what the public interest requires to protect the health of persons," even if that means that &lt;i&gt;"industries will be asked to do what seems to be impossible at the present time."&lt;/i&gt; 116 Cong. Rec. 32901-32902 (1970), 1 Legislative History of the Clean Air Amendments of 1970 (Committee Print compiled for the Senate Committee on Public Works by the Library of Congress), Ser. No. 93-18, p. 227 (1974) (hereinafter Leg. Hist.) (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate directly focused upon the technical feasibility and cost of implementing the Act's mandates. And it made clear that it intended the Administrator to develop air quality standards set independently of either. The Senate Report for the 1970 amendments explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the Committee discussions, considerable concern was expressed regarding the use of the concept of technical feasibility as the basis of ambient air standards. The Committee determined that 1) &lt;i&gt;the health of people&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;is more important than the question of whether the&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;early achievement of ambient air quality standards&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;protective of health is technically feasible;&lt;/i&gt; and, 2) the growth of pollution load in many areas, even with application of available technology, would still be deleterious to public health. . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Therefore, the Committee determined that &lt;i&gt;existing&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;sources of pollutants either should meet the standard&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;of the law or be closed down&lt;/i&gt; . . . ." S. Rep. No. 91-1196, pp. 2-3 (1970), 1 Leg. Hist. 402-403 (emphasis added).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this Court, after reviewing the entire legislative history, concluded that the 1970 amendments were "expressly designed to force regulated sources to develop pollution control devices that &lt;i&gt;might at the time appear to be economically or technologically infeasible." &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Union Elec. Co.&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*492&lt;/span&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;EPA,&lt;/i&gt; 427 U. S. 246, 257 (1976) (emphasis added). And the Court added that the 1970 amendments were intended to be a "drastic remedy to . . . a serious and otherwise uncheckable problem." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 256. Subsequent legislative history confirms that the technology-forcing goals of the 1970 amendments are still paramount in today's Act. See Clean Air Conference Report (1977): Statement of Intent; Clarification of Select Provisions, 123 Cong. Rec. 27070 (1977) (stating, regarding the 1977 amendments to the Act, that "this year's legislation retains and even strengthens the technology forcing . . . goals of the 1970 Act"); S. Rep. No. 101-228, p. 5 (1989) (stating that the 1990 amendments to the Act require ambient air quality standards to be set at "the level that `protects the public health' with an `adequate margin of safety,' &lt;i&gt;without regard to the economic or technical feasibility of attainment"&lt;/i&gt; (emphasis added)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To read this legislative history as meaning what it says does not impute to Congress an irrational intent. Technology-forcing hopes can prove realistic. Those persons, for example, who opposed the 1970 Act's insistence on a 90% reduction in auto emission pollutants, on the ground of excessive cost, saw the development of catalytic converter technology that helped achieve substantial reductions without the economic catastrophe that some had feared. See &#167; 6(a) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, amending &#167;&#167; 202(b)(1)(A), (B), 84 Stat. 1690 (codified at 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 7521(b)(1)(A), (B)) (requiring a 90% reduction in emissions); 1 Leg. Hist. 238, 240 (statement of Sen. Griffin) (arguing that the emissions standards could "force [the automobile] industry out of existence" because costs "would not be taken into account"); see generally Reitze, Mobile Source Air Pollution Control, 6 Env. Law. 309, 326-327 (2000) (discussing the development of the catalytic converter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the statute's technology-forcing objective makes regulatory efforts to determine the costs of implementation both less important and more difficult. It &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*493&lt;/span&gt; means that the relevant economic costs are speculative, for they include the cost of unknown future technologies. It also means that efforts to take costs into account can breed time-consuming and potentially unresolvable arguments about the accuracy and significance of cost estimates. Congress could have thought such efforts not worth the delays and uncertainties that would accompany them. In any event, that is what the statute's history seems to say. See &lt;i&gt;Union Elec., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 256-259. And the matter is one for Congress to decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Act does not, on this reading, wholly ignore cost and feasibility. As the majority points out, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 466-467, the Act allows regulators to take those concerns into account when they determine how to implement ambient air quality standards. Thus, States may consider economic costs when they select the particular control devices used to meet the standards, and industries experiencing difficulty in reducing their emissions can seek an exemption or variance from the state implementation plan. See &lt;i&gt;Union Elec., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 266 ("[T]he most important forum for consideration of claims of economic and technological infeasibility is before the state agency formulating the implementation plan").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Act also permits the EPA, within certain limits, to consider costs when it sets deadlines by which areas must attain the ambient air quality standards. 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7502(a)(2)(A) (providing that "the Administrator may extend the attainment date . . . for a period no greater than 10 years from the date of designation as nonattainment, considering the severity of nonattainment and the availability and feasibility of pollution control measures"); &#167; 7502(a)(2)(C) (permitting the Administrator to grant up to two additional 1-year extensions); cf. &#167;&#167; 7511(a)(1), (5) (setting more rigid attainment deadlines for areas in nonattainment of the ozone standard, but permitting the Administrator to grant up to two 1-year extensions). And Congress can change those statutory limits if necessary. Given the ambient air quality &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*494&lt;/span&gt; standards' substantial effects on States, cities, industries, and their suppliers and customers, Congress will hear from those whom compliance deadlines affect adversely, and Congress can consider whether legislative change is warranted. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Steel Industry Compliance Extension Act of 1981, 95 Stat. 139 (codified at 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7413(e) (1988 ed.)) (repealed 1990) (granting the Administrator discretion to extend the ambient air quality standard attainment date set in the 1977 Act by up to three years for steelmaking facilities).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, contrary to the suggestion of the Court of Appeals and of some parties, this interpretation of &#167; 109 does not require the EPA to eliminate every health risk, however slight, at any economic cost, however great, to the point of "hurtling" industry over "the brink of ruin," or even forcing "deindustrialization." &lt;i&gt;American Trucking Assns., Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;EPA,&lt;/i&gt; 175 F. 3d 1027, 1037, 1038, n. 4 (CADC 1999); see also Brief for Cross-Petitioners in No. 99-1426, p. 25. The statute, by its express terms, does not compel the elimination of &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; risk; and it grants the Administrator sufficient flexibility to avoid setting ambient air quality standards ruinous to industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 109(b)(1) directs the Administrator to set standards that are "requisite to protect the public health" with "an adequate margin of safety." But these words do not describe a world that is free of all risk&#151;an impossible and undesirable objective. See &lt;i&gt;Industrial Union Dept., AFL&#151;CIO&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;American Petroleum Institute,&lt;/i&gt; 448 U. S. 607, 642 (1980) (plurality opinion) (the word "safe" does not mean "riskfree"). Nor are the words "requisite" and "public health" to be understood independent of context. We consider football equipment "safe" even if its use entails a level of risk that would make drinking water "unsafe" for consumption. And what counts as "requisite" to protecting the public health will similarly vary with background circumstances, such as the public's ordinary tolerance of the particular health risk in the particular context at issue. The Administrator can &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*495&lt;/span&gt; consider such background circumstances when "decid[ing] what risks are acceptable in the world in which we live." &lt;i&gt;Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;EPA,&lt;/i&gt; 824 F. 2d 1146, 1165 (CADC 1987).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statute also permits the Administrator to take account of comparative health risks. That is to say, she may consider whether a proposed rule promotes safety overall. A rule likely to cause more harm to health than it prevents is not a rule that is "requisite to protect the public health." For example, as the Court of Appeals held and the parties do not contest, the Administrator has the authority to determine to what extent possible health risks stemming from reductions in tropospheric ozone (which, it is claimed, helps prevent cataracts and skin cancer) should be taken into account in setting the ambient air quality standard for ozone. See 175 F. 3d, at 1050-1053 (remanding for the Administrator to make that determination).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statute ultimately specifies that the standard set must be "requisite to protect the public health" &lt;i&gt;"in the judgment of the Administrator,"&lt;/i&gt; &#167; 109(b)(1), 84 Stat. 1680 (emphasis added), a phrase that grants the Administrator considerable discretionary standard-setting authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statute's words, then, authorize the Administrator to consider the severity of a pollutant's potential adverse health effects, the number of those likely to be affected, the distribution of the adverse effects, and the uncertainties surrounding each estimate. Cf. Sunstein, Is the Clean Air Act Unconstitutional?, 98 Mich. L. Rev. 303, 364 (1999). They permit the Administrator to take account of comparative health consequences. They allow her to take account of context when determining the acceptability of small risks to health. And they give her considerable discretion when she does so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discretion would seem sufficient to avoid the extreme results that some of the industry parties fear. After all, the EPA, in setting standards that "protect the public health" &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*496&lt;/span&gt; with "an adequate margin of safety," retains discretionary authority to avoid regulating risks that it reasonably concludes are trivial in context. Nor need regulation lead to deindustrialization. Preindustrial society was not a very healthy society; hence a standard demanding the return of the Stone Age would not prove "requisite to protect the public health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I rely more heavily than does the Court upon legislative history and alternative sources of statutory flexibility, I reach the same ultimate conclusion. Section 109 does not delegate to the EPA authority to base the national ambient air quality standards, in whole or in part, upon the economic costs of compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1]  None of the sections of the CAA in which the District of Columbia Circuit has found authority for the EPA to consider costs shares &#167; 109(b)(1)'s prominence in the overall statutory scheme. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Michigan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;EPA,&lt;/i&gt;  213 F. 3d 663, 678-679 (CADC 2000); &lt;i&gt;George E. Warren Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;EPA,&lt;/i&gt; 159 F. 3d 616, 623-624 (CADC 1998); &lt;i&gt;Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;EPA,&lt;/i&gt; 824 F. 2d 1146, 1154-1163 (CADC 1987) (en banc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Respondents contend that this advice is required to be included in the NAAQS rulemaking record&#151;which, if true, would suggest that it was relevant to the standard-setting process. But the provision respondents cite for their contention, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7607(d)(3), requires only that "&lt;i&gt;pertinent&lt;/i&gt; findings, recommendations, and comments by the Scientific Review Committee" be included. The Committee's advice concerning certain aspects of "adverse public health . . . effects" from various attainment strategies is unquestionably pertinent; but to say that Committeegenerated cost data are pertinent is to beg the question. Likewise, while "all written comments" must be placed in the docket, &#167; 7607(d)(4)(B)(i), the EPA need respond only to the "significant" ones, &#167; 7407(d)(6)(B); comments regarding cost data are not significant if cost data are irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Respondents scarcely mention in their arguments the &lt;i&gt;secondary&lt;/i&gt;  NAAQS required by &#167; 109(b)(2), 42 U. S. C. &#167; 7409(b)(2). For many of the same reasons described in the body of the opinion, as well as the text of &#167; 109(b)(2), which instructs the EPA to set the standards at a level "requisite to protect the public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects &lt;i&gt;associated with the presence of such air pollutant in the ambient air&lt;/i&gt; " (emphasis added), we conclude that the EPA may not consider implementation costs in setting the secondary NAAQS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Respondents' speculation that the EPA is secretly considering the costs of attainment without telling anyone is irrelevant to our interpretive inquiry. If such an allegation could be proved, it would be grounds for vacating the NAAQS, because the Administrator had not followed the law. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chevron U. S. A. Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 837, 842-843 (1984); &lt;i&gt;Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt;  523 U. S. 382, 387 (1998). It would not, however, be grounds for this Court's changing the law.&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*4&lt;/span&gt; Souter, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Malcolm L. Stewart&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Ogden, Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler, Leonard Schaitman, Matthew M. Collette, John Leshy,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Scott Bergstrom.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Andrew M. Hitchings&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Paul S. Simmons&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Donald B. Ayer.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Souter, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documents in issue here, passing between Indian Tribes and the Department of the Interior, addressed tribal interests subject to state and federal proceedings to determine water allocations. The question is whether the documents are exempt from the disclosure requirements of the Freedom of Information Act, as "intra-agency memorandums or &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*5&lt;/span&gt; letters" that would normally be privileged in civil discovery. 5 U. S. C. &#167; 552(b)(5). We hold they are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two separate proceedings give rise to this case, the first a planning effort within the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation, and the second a state water rights adjudication in the Oregon courts. Within the Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) administers the Klamath Irrigation Project (Klamath Project or Project), which uses water from the Klamath River Basin to irrigate territory in Klamath County, Oregon, and two northern California counties. In 1995, the Department began work to develop a long-term operations plan for the Project, to be known as the Klamath Project Operation Plan (Plan), which would provide for allocation of water among competing uses and competing water users. The Department asked the Klamath as well as the Hoopa Valley, Karuk, and Yurok Tribes (Basin Tribes) to consult with Reclamation on the matter, and a memorandum of understanding between the Department and the Tribes recognized that "[t]he United States Government has a unique legal relationship with Native American tribal governments," and called for "[a]ssessment, in consultation with the Tribes, of the impacts of the [Plan] on Tribal trust resources." App. 59, 61.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During roughly the same period, the Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs (Bureau) filed claims on behalf of the Klamath Tribe alone in an Oregon state-court adjudication intended to allocate water rights. Since the Bureau is responsible for administering land and water held in trust for Indian tribes, 25 U. S. C. &#167; 1a; 25 CFR subch. H, pts. 150-181 (2000), it consulted with the Klamath Tribe, and the two exchanged written memorandums on the appropriate scope of the claims ultimately submitted by the United States for the benefit of the Klamath Tribe. The Bureau does not, however, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*6&lt;/span&gt; act as counsel for the Tribe, which has its own lawyers and has independently submitted claims on its own behalf.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent, the Klamath Water Users Protective Association (Association), is a nonprofit association of water users in the Klamath River Basin, most of whom receive water from the Klamath Project, and whose interests are adverse to the tribal interests owing to scarcity of water. The Association filed a series of requests with the Bureau under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U. S. C. &#167; 552, seeking access to communications between the Bureau and the Basin Tribes during the relevant time period. The Bureau turned over several documents but withheld others as exempt under the attorney work-product and deliberative process privileges. These privileges are said to be incorporated in FOIA Exemption 5, which exempts from disclosure "inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency." &#167; 552(b)(5). The Association then sued the Bureau under FOIA to compel release of the documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time of the District Court ruling, seven documents remained in dispute, three of them addressing the Plan, three concerned with the Oregon adjudication, and the seventh relevant to both proceedings. See 189 F. 3d 1034, 1036 (CA9 1999), App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a-49a. Six of the documents were prepared by the Klamath Tribe or its representative and were submitted at the Government's behest to the Bureau or to the Department's Regional Solicitor; a Bureau official prepared the seventh document and gave it to lawyers for the Klamath and Yurok Tribes. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*7&lt;/span&gt; The District Court granted the Government's motion for summary judgment. It held that each document qualified as an inter-agency or intra-agency communication for purposes of Exemption 5, and that each was covered by the deliberative process privilege or the attorney work-product privilege, as having played a role in the Bureau's deliberations about the Plan or the Oregon adjudication. See 189 F. 3d, at 1036, App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a-32a, 56a-65a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 189 F. 3d 1034 (1999). It recognized that some Circuits had adopted a "functional" approach to Exemption 5, under which a document generated outside the Government might still qualify as an "intra-agency" communication. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1037-1038. The court saw no reason to go into that, however, for it ruled out any application of Exemption 5 on the ground that "the Tribes with whom the Department has a consulting relationship have a direct interest in the subject matter of the consultations." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1038. The court said that "[t]o hold otherwise would extend Exemption 5 to shield what amount to ex parte communications in contested proceedings between the Tribes and the Department." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt;  Judge Hawkins dissented, for he saw the documents as springing "from a relationship that remains consultative rather than adversarial, a relationship in which the Bureau and Department were seeking the expertise of the Tribes, rather than opposing them." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1045. He saw the proper enquiry as going not to a document's source, but to the role it plays in agency decisionmaking. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1039. We granted certiorari in view of the decision's significant impact on the relationship between Indian tribes and the Government, 530 U. S. 1304 (2000), and now affirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon request, FOIA mandates disclosure of records held by a federal agency, see 5 U. S. C. &#167; 552, unless the documents fall within enumerated exemptions, see &#167; 552(b). "[T]hese &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*8&lt;/span&gt; limited exemptions do not obscure the basic policy that disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of the Act," &lt;i&gt;Department of Air Force&lt;/i&gt; v.&lt;i&gt;Rose,&lt;/i&gt; 425 U. S. 352, 361 (1976); "[c]onsistent with the Act's goal of broad disclosure, these exemptions have been consistently given a narrow compass," &lt;i&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tax Analysts,&lt;/i&gt; 492 U. S. 136, 151 (1989); see also &lt;i&gt;FBI&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Abramson,&lt;/i&gt; 456 U. S. 615, 630 (1982) ("FOIA exemptions are to be narrowly construed").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exemption 5 protects from disclosure "inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency." 5 U. S. C. &#167; 552(b)(5). To qualify, a document must thus satisfy two conditions: its source must be a Government agency, and it must fall within the ambit of a privilege against discovery under judicial standards that would govern litigation against the agency that holds it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our prior cases on Exemption 5 have addressed the second condition, incorporating civil discovery privileges. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Weber Aircraft Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 465 U. S. 792, 799-800 (1984); &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sears, Roebuck &amp;amp; Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 421 U. S. 132, 148 (1975) ("Exemption 5 withholds from a member of the public documents which a private party could not discover in litigation with the agency"). So far as they might matter here, those privileges include the privilege for attorney workproduct and what is sometimes called the "deliberative process" privilege. Work product protects "mental processes of the attorney," &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Nobles,&lt;/i&gt; 422 U. S. 225, 238 (1975), while deliberative process covers "documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated," &lt;i&gt;Sears, Roebuck &amp;amp; Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 421 U. S., at 150 (internal quotation marks omitted). The deliberative process privilege rests on the obvious realization that officials will not communicate candidly among themselves &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*9&lt;/span&gt; if each remark is a potential item of discovery and front page news, and its object is to enhance "the quality of agency decisions," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 151, by protecting open and frank discussion among those who make them within the Government, see &lt;i&gt;EPA&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mink,&lt;/i&gt; 410 U. S. 73, 86-87 (1973); see also &lt;i&gt;Weber Aircraft Corp., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 802.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is not to protect Government secrecy pure and simple, however, and the first condition of Exemption 5 is no less important than the second; the communication must be "inter-agency or intra-agency." 5 U. S. C. &#167; 552(b)(5). Statutory definitions underscore the apparent plainness of this text. With exceptions not relevant here, "agency" means "each authority of the Government of the United States," &#167; 551(1), and "includes any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government . . . , or any independent regulatory agency," &#167; 552(f).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although neither the terms of the exemption nor the statutory definitions say anything about communications with outsiders, some Courts of Appeals have held that in some circumstances a document prepared outside the Government may nevertheless qualify as an "intra-agency" memorandum under Exemption 5. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hoover&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dept. of Interior,&lt;/i&gt;  611 F. 2d 1132, 1137-1138 (CA5 1980); &lt;i&gt;Lead Industries Assn.&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;OSHA,&lt;/i&gt; 610 F. 2d 70, 83 (CA2 1979); &lt;i&gt;Soucie&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;David,&lt;/i&gt; 448 F. 2d 1067 (CADC 1971). In &lt;i&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Julian,&lt;/i&gt; 486 U. S. 1 (1988), Justice Scalia, joined by Justices O'Connor and White, explained that "the most natural meaning of the phrase `intra-agency memorandum' is a memorandum that is addressed both to and from employees of a single agency," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 18, n. 1 (dissenting opinion). But his opinion also acknowledged the more expansive reading by some Courts of Appeals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is textually possible and . . . in accord with the purpose of the provision, to regard as an intra-agency memorandum &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*10&lt;/span&gt; one that has been received by an agency, to assist it in the performance of its own functions, from a person acting in a governmentally conferred capacity other than on behalf of another agency&#151;&lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; in a capacity as employee or consultant to the agency, or as employee or officer of another governmental unit (not an agency) that is authorized or required to provide advice to the agency." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, courts taking the latter view have held that the exemption extends to communications between Government agencies and outside consultants hired by them. See&lt;i&gt;, e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hoover, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 1138 ("In determining value, the government may deem it necessary to seek the objective opinion of outside experts rather than rely solely on the opinions of government appraisers"); &lt;i&gt;Lead Industries Assn., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 83 (applying Exemption 5 to cover draft reports "prepared by outside consultants who had testified on behalf of the agency rather than agency staff"); see also &lt;i&gt;Government Land Bank&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;GSA,&lt;/i&gt; 671 F. 2d 663, 665 (CA5 1982) ("Both parties agree that a property appraisal, performed under contract by an independent professional, is an `intra-agency' document for purposes of the exemption"). In such cases, the records submitted by outside consultants played essentially the same part in an agency's process of deliberation as documents prepared by agency personnel might have done. To be sure, the consultants in these cases were independent contractors and were not assumed to be subject to the degree of control that agency employment could have entailed; nor do we read the cases as necessarily assuming that an outside consultant must be devoid of a definite point of view when the agency contracts for its services. But the fact &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*11&lt;/span&gt; about the consultant that is constant in the typical cases is that the consultant does not represent an interest of its own, or the interest of any other client, when it advises the agency that hires it. Its only obligations are to truth and its sense of what good judgment calls for, and in those respects the consultant functions just as an employee would be expected to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department purports to rely on this consultant corollary to Exemption 5 in arguing for its application to the Tribe's communications to the Bureau in its capacity of fiduciary for the benefit of the Indian Tribes. The existence of a trust obligation is not, of course, in question, see &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cherokee Nation of Okla.,&lt;/i&gt; 480 U. S. 700, 707 (1987); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mitchell,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S. 206, 225 (1983); &lt;i&gt;Seminole Nation&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 316 U. S. 286, 296-297 (1942). The fiduciary relationship has been described as "one of the primary cornerstones of Indian law," F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 221 (1982), and has been compared to one existing under a common law trust, with the United States as trustee, the Indian tribes or individuals as beneficiaries, and the property and natural resources managed by the United States as the trust corpus. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mitchell, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 225. Nor is there any doubt about the plausibility of the Government's assertion that the candor of tribal communications with the Bureau would be eroded without the protections of the deliberative process privilege recognized under Exemption 5. The Department is surely right in saying that confidentiality in communications with tribes is conducive to a proper discharge of its trust obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the recognition of this interest in frank communication, which the deliberative process privilege might protect, the Department would have us infer a sufficient justification for applying Exemption 5 to communications with the Tribes, in the same fashion that Courts of Appeals have found sufficient reason to favor a consultant's advice that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*12&lt;/span&gt; way. But the Department's argument skips a necessary step, for it ignores the first condition of Exemption 5, that the communication be "intra-agency or inter-agency." The Department seems to be saying that "intra-agency" is a purely conclusory term, just a label to be placed on any document the Government would find it valuable to keep confidential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, however, no textual justification for draining the first condition of independent vitality, and once the intraagency condition is applied,&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; it rules out any application of Exemption 5 to tribal communications on analogy to consultants' reports (assuming, which we do not decide, that these reports may qualify as intra-agency under Exemption 5). As mentioned already, consultants whose communications have typically been held exempt have not been communicating with the Government in their own interest or on behalf of any person or group whose interests might be affected by the Government action addressed by the consultant. In that regard, consultants may be enough like the agency's own personnel to justify calling their communications "intra-agency." The Tribes, on the contrary, necessarily communicate with the Bureau with their own, albeit entirely legitimate, interests in mind. While this fact alone distinguishes tribal communications from the consultants' examples recognized by several Courts of Appeals, the distinction is even sharper, in that the Tribes are self-advocates at the expense of others seeking benefits inadequate to satisfy everyone.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*13&lt;/span&gt; As to those documents bearing on the Plan, the Tribes are obviously in competition with nontribal claimants, including those irrigators represented by the respondent. App. 66-71. The record shows that documents submitted by the Tribes included, among others, "a position paper that discusses water law legal theories" and "addresses issues related to water rights of the tribes," App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a-43a, a memorandum "contain[ing] views on policy the BIA could provide to other governmental agencies," "views concerning trust resources," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 44a, and a letter "conveying the views of the Klamath Tribes concerning issues involved in the water rights adjudication," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 47a. While these documents may not take the formally argumentative form of a brief, their function is quite apparently to support the tribal claims. The Tribes are thus urging a position necessarily adverse to the other claimants, the water being inadequate to satisfy the combined demand. As the Court of Appeals said, "[t]he Tribes' demands, if satisfied, would lead to reduced water allocations to members of the Association and have been protested by Association members who fear water shortages and economic injury in dry years." 189 F. 3d, at 1035.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department insists that the Klamath Tribe's consultant-like character is clearer in the circumstances of the Oregon adjudication, since the Department merely represents the interests of the Tribe before a state court that will &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*14&lt;/span&gt; make any decision about the respective rights of the contenders. Brief for Petitioners 42-45; Reply Brief for Petitioners 4-6. But it is not that simple. Even if there were no rival interests at stake in the Oregon litigation, the Klamath Tribe would be pressing its own view of its own interest in its communications with the Bureau. Nor could that interest be ignored as being merged somehow in the fiduciary interest of the Government trustee; the Bureau in its fiduciary capacity would be obliged to adopt the stance it believed to be in the beneficiary's best interest, not necessarily the position espoused by the beneficiary itself. Cf. Restatement (Second) of Trusts &#167; 176, Comment &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; (1957) ("[I]t is the duty of the trustee to exercise such care and skill to preserve the trust property as a man of ordinary prudence would exercise in dealing with his own property . . .").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, again, the dispositive point is that the apparent object of the Tribe's communications is a decision by an agency of the Government to support a claim by the Tribe that is necessarily adverse to the interests of competitors. Since there is not enough water to satisfy everyone, the Government's position on behalf of the Tribe is potentially adverse to other users, and it might ask for more or less on behalf of the Tribe depending on how it evaluated the tribal claim compared with the claims of its rivals. The ultimately adversarial character of tribal submissions to the Bureau therefore seems the only fair inference, as confirmed by the Department's acknowledgment that its "obligation to represent the Klamath Tribe necessarily coexists with the duty to protect other federal interests, including in particular its interests with respect to the Klamath Project." Reply Brief for Petitioners 8; cf. &lt;i&gt;Nevada&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S. 110, 142 (1983) ("[W]here Congress has imposed upon the United States, in addition to its duty to represent Indian tribes, a duty to obtain water rights for reclamation projects, and has even authorized the inclusion of reservation lands within a project, the analogy of a faithless private fiduciary cannot be &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*15&lt;/span&gt; controlling for purposes of evaluating the authority of the United States to represent different interests"). The position of the Tribe as beneficiary is thus a far cry from the position of the paid consultant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite apart from its attempt to draw a direct analogy between tribes and conventional consultants, the Department argues that compelled release of the documents would itself impair the Department's performance of a specific fiduciary obligation to protect the confidentiality of communications with tribes.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; Because, the Department argues, traditional fiduciary standards forbid a trustee to disclose information acquired as a trustee when it should know that disclosure would be against the beneficiary's interests, excluding the Tribes' submissions to the Department from Exemption 5 would handicap the Department in doing what the law requires. Brief for Petitioners 36-37.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; And in much the same vein, the Department presses the argument that "FOIA is intended to cast light on existing government practices; it should not be interpreted and applied so as to compel federal agencies to perform their assigned substantive functions in other than the normal manner." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this boils down to requesting that we read an "Indian trust" exemption into the statute, a reading that is out &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*16&lt;/span&gt; of the question for reasons already explored. There is simply no support for the exemption in the statutory text, which we have elsewhere insisted be read strictly in order to serve FOIA's mandate of broad disclosure,&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; which was obviously expected and intended to affect Government operations. In FOIA, after all, a new conception of Government conduct was enacted into law, "`a general philosophy of full agency disclosure.' " &lt;i&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tax Analysts,&lt;/i&gt; 492 U. S., at 142 (quoting S. Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1965)). "Congress believed that this philosophy, put into practice, would help `ensure an informed citizenry, vital to the functioning of a democratic society.' " 492 U. S., at 142 (quoting &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Robbins Tire &amp;amp; Rubber Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 437 U. S. 214, 242 (1978)). Congress had to realize that not every secret under the old law would be secret under the new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1]  The Government is"not technically acting as [the Tribes']attorney. That is, the Tribes have their own attorneys, but the United States acts as trustee." Tr. of Oral Arg. 5. "The United States has also filed claims on behalf of the Project and on behalf of other Federal interests" in the Oregon adjudication. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 6. The Hoopa Valley,Karuk, and Yurok Tribes are not parties to the adjudication.Brief for Respondent 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The majority in &lt;i&gt;Julian&lt;/i&gt; did not address the question whether the documents at issue were "inter-agency or intra-agency" records within the meaning of Exemption 5, because it concluded that the documents would be routinely discoverable in civil litigation and therefore would not be covered by Exemption 5 in any event. 486 U. S., at 11-14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Because we conclude that the documents do not meet this threshold condition, we need not reach step two of the Exemption 5 analysis and enquire whether the communications would normally be discoverable in civil litigation. See &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Weber Aircraft Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 465 U. S. 792, 799 (1984).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Courts of Appeals have recognized at least two instances of intraagency consultants that arguably extend beyond what we have characterized as the typical examples. In &lt;i&gt;Public Citizen, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Department of Justice,&lt;/i&gt; 111 F. 3d 168 (CADC 1997), former Presidents were so treated in their communications with the National Archives and Records Administration, even though the Presidents had their own, independent interests, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 171. And in &lt;i&gt;Ryan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Department of Justice,&lt;/i&gt; 617 F. 2d 781 (CADC 1980), Senators' responses to the Attorney General's questionnaires about the judicial nomination process were held exempt, even though we would expect a Senator to have strong personal views on the matter. We need not decide whether either instance should be recognized as intra-agency, even if communications with paid consultants are ultimately so treated. As explained above, the intra-agency condition excludes, at the least, communications to or from an interested party seeking a Government benefit at the expense of other applicants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  The Department points out that the Plan-related documents submitted by the Tribes were furnished to the Bureau rather than to Reclamation, a fact which the Department claims reinforces the conclusion that the documents were provided to the Department in its capacity as trustee. Brief for Petitioners 47. This fact does not alter our analysis, however, because we think that even communications made in support of the trust relationship fail to fit comfortably within the statutory text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  We note that the Department cites the Restatement for the proposition that a "`trustee is under a duty to the beneficiary not to disclose to a third person information which he has acquired as trustee where he should know that the effect of such disclosure would be detrimental to the interest of the beneficiary.' " Brief for Petitioners 36 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Trusts &#167; 170, Comment &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; (1957)). It is unnecessary for us to decide if the Department's duties with respect to its communications with Indian tribes fit this pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  The Department does not attempt to argue that Congress specifically envisioned that Exemption 5 would cover communications pursuant to the Indian trust responsibility, or any other trust responsibility. Although as a general rule we are hesitant to construe statutes in light of legislative inaction, see &lt;i&gt;Bob Jones Univ.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 461 U. S. 574, 600 (1983), we note that Congress has twice considered specific proposals to protect Indian trust information, see Indian Amendment to Freedom of Information Act: Hearings on S. 2652 before the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. (1976); Indian Trust Information Protection Act of 1978, S. 2773, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978). We do so because these proposals confirm the commonsense reading that we give Exemption 5 today, as well as to emphasize that nobody in the Federal Government should be surprised by this reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Argued January 8, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided March 20, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*61&lt;/span&gt; Breyer, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dean A. Strang&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Brian P. Mullins&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Robert A. Kagen.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Paul R. Q. Wolfson&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Robinson,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Breyer, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case raises a narrow question of sentencing law. What standard of review applies when a court of appeals reviews a trial court's Sentencing Guideline determination as to whether an offender's prior convictions were consolidated, hence "related," for purposes of sentencing? In particular, should the appeals court review the trial court's decision deferentially or &lt;i&gt;de novo?&lt;/i&gt; We conclude, as did the Court of Appeals, that deferential review is appropriate, and we affirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial court decision at issue focused on one aspect of the United States Sentencing Guidelines' treatment of "career offenders," a category of offender subject to particularly severe punishment. The Guidelines define a "career offender" as an offender with "at least two prior felony convictions" for violent or drug-related crimes. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual &#167; 4B1.1 (Nov. 2000) (USSG). At the same time, they provide that a sentencing judge must count as a single prior felony conviction &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*61&lt;/span&gt; all those that are "related" to one another. USSG &#167; 4B1.2(c), and comment., n. 3; &#167; 4A1.2(a)(2). And they advise (in an application note) that prior convictions are "related" to one another when, &lt;i&gt;inter alia,&lt;/i&gt; they "were consolidated for . . . sentencing." &#167; 4A1.2, comment., n. 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seventh Circuit has refined this "prior conviction" doctrine yet further. It has held that two prior convictions might have been "consolidated for sentencing," and hence "related," even if the sentencing court did not enter any &lt;i&gt;formal&lt;/i&gt; order of consolidation. See &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Joseph,&lt;/i&gt; 50 F. 3d 401, 404, cert. denied, 516 U. S. 847 (1995). In such an instance, the Circuit has said, a court should decide whether the convictions were nonetheless "&lt;i&gt;functionally&lt;/i&gt; consolidated," which means that the convictions were "factually or logically related, and sentencing was joint." 201 F. 3d 937, 940 (2000) (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case concerns "functional consolidation." Paula Buford pleaded guilty to armed bank robbery, a crime of violence, in federal court. The federal sentencing judge had to decide whether Buford's five 1992 Wisconsin state-court convictions were "related" to one another, and consequently counted as one single prior conviction, or whether they should count as more than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government conceded that four of the five prior convictions were "related" to one another. These four involved a series of gas station robberies. All four had been the subject of a single criminal indictment, and Buford had pleaded guilty to all four at the same time in the same court. See USSG &#167; 4A1.2, comment., n. 3 (prior offenses are "related" if "consolidated for trial or sentencing").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government did not concede, however, that the fifth conviction, for a drug crime, was "related" to the other four. The drug crime (possession of, with intent to deliver, cocaine) had taken place about the same time as the fourth &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*62&lt;/span&gt; robbery, and Buford claimed that the robberies had been motivated by her drug addiction. But the only evidentiary link among the crimes was that the police had discovered the cocaine when searching Buford's house after her arrest for the robberies. Moreover, no formal order of consolidation had been entered. The State had charged the drug offense in a separate indictment and had assigned a different prosecutor to handle the drug case. A different judge had heard Buford plead guilty to the drug charge in a different hearing held on a different date; two different state prosecutors had appeared before the sentencing court, one discussing drugs, the other discussing the robberies; and the sentencing court had entered two separate judgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buford, without denying these facts, nonetheless pointed to other circumstances that, in her view, showed that the drug crime conviction had been "consolidated" with the robbery convictions for sentencing, rendering her drug conviction and robbery convictions "related." She pointed out that the State had sent the four robbery cases for sentencing to the very same judge who had heard and accepted her plea of guilty to the drug charge; that the judge had heard arguments about sentencing in all five cases at the same time in a single proceeding; that the judge had issued sentences for all five crimes at the same time; and that the judge, having imposed three sentences for the five crimes (6 years for the drug crime, 12 years for two robberies, and 15 years for the other two), had ordered all three to run concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Court, placing greater weight on the former circumstances than on the latter, decided that the drug case and the robbery cases had not been consolidated for sentencing, either formally or functionally. Buford appealed. The Court of Appeals found the "functional consolidation" question a close one, and wrote that "the standard of appellate review may be dispositive." 201 F. 3d, at 940. It decided to review the District Court's decision "deferentially" rather &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*63&lt;/span&gt; than "&lt;i&gt;de novo.&lt;/i&gt; " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 942. And it affirmed that decision. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buford sought certiorari. In light of the different Circuits' different approaches to the problem, we granted the writ. Compare &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Irons,&lt;/i&gt; 196 F. 3d 634, 638 (CA6 1999) (relatedness decision reviewed for clear error); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wiseman,&lt;/i&gt; 172 F. 3d 1196, 1219 (CA10) (same), cert. denied, 528 U. S. 889 (1999); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mapp,&lt;/i&gt; 170 F. 3d 328, 338 (CA2) (same), cert. denied, 528 U. S. 901 (1999); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maza,&lt;/i&gt; 93 F. 3d 1390, 1400 (CA8 1996) (same), cert. denied, 519 U. S. 1138 (1997); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mullens,&lt;/i&gt; 65 F. 3d 1560, 1565 (CA11 1995), cert. denied, 517 U. S. 1112 (1996) (same), with &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Garcia,&lt;/i&gt; 962 F. 2d 479, 481 (CA5) (relatedness determination reviewed &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; ), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 902 (1992); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Davis,&lt;/i&gt; 922 F. 2d 1385, 1388 (CA9 1991) (same).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In arguing for &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; review, Buford points out that she has not contested any relevant underlying issue of fact. She disagrees only with the District Court's legal conclusion that a legal label&#151;"functional consolidation"&#151;failed to fit the undisputed facts. She concedes, as she must, that this circumstance does not dispose of the standard of review question. That is because the relevant federal sentencing statute requires a reviewing court not only to "accept" a district court's "findings of fact" (unless "clearly erroneous"), but also to "give &lt;i&gt;due deference&lt;/i&gt; to the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts." 18 U. S. C. &#167; 3742(e) (emphasis added). And that is the kind of determination&#151;application of the Guidelines to the facts&#151;that is at issue here. Hence the question we must answer is what kind of "deference" is "due." And, as we noted in &lt;i&gt;Koon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 518 U. S. 81, 98 (1996), the "deference that is due depends on the nature of the question presented."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*64&lt;/span&gt; Buford argues that the nature of the question presented here&#151;applying a Sentencing Guidelines term to undisputed facts&#151;demands no deference at all. That is to say, the deference "due" is no deference; hence the Court of Appeals should have reviewed the trial court's decision &lt;i&gt;de novo.&lt;/i&gt; Buford points out that, because the underlying facts are not in dispute, witness credibility is not important. She adds that &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; appellate review will help clarify and make meaningful the consolidation-related legal principles at issue. And she says that &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; review will help avoid inconsistent trial court determinations about consolidation, thereby furthering the Guidelines' effort to bring consistency to sentencing law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these arguments, we believe that the appellate court was right to review this trial court decision deferentially rather than &lt;i&gt;de novo.&lt;/i&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Koon,&lt;/i&gt; we based our selection of an abuse-of-discretion standard of review on the relative institutional advantages enjoyed by the district court in making the type of determination at issue. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 98-99; cf. &lt;i&gt;Miller&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fenton,&lt;/i&gt; 474 U. S. 104, 114 (1985) (deference may depend on whether "one judicial actor is better positioned than another to decide the issue in question"). We concluded there that the special competence of the district court helped to make deferential review appropriate. And that is true here as well. That is to say, the district court is in a better position than the appellate court to decide whether a particular set of individual circumstances demonstrates "functional consolidation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is so because a district judge sees many more "consolidations" than does an appellate judge. As a trial judge, a district judge is likely to be more familiar with trial and sentencing practices in general, including consolidation procedures. And as a sentencing judge who must regularly review and classify defendants' criminal histories, a district judge is more likely to be aware of which procedures the relevant state or federal courts typically follow. Experience with trials, sentencing, and consolidations will help that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*65&lt;/span&gt; judge draw the proper inferences from the procedural descriptions provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, factual nuance may closely guide the legal decision, with legal results depending heavily upon an understanding of the significance of case-specific details. See &lt;i&gt;Koon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 98-99 (District Court's detailed understanding of the case before it and experience with other sentencing cases favored deferential review); &lt;i&gt;Cooter &amp;amp; Gell&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hartmarx Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 496 U. S. 384, 403-404 (1990) (fact-intensive nature of decision whether to impose sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 made deferential review appropriate); &lt;i&gt;Pierce&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Underwood,&lt;/i&gt; 487 U. S. 552, 560 (1988) (District Court's familiarity with facts of case warranted deferential review of determination whether Government's legal position was "substantially justified"). In a case like this one, for example, under Seventh Circuit doctrine, the District Judge usefully might have considered the factual details of the crimes at issue in order to determine whether factual connections among those crimes, rather than, say, administrative convenience, led Wisconsin to sentence Buford simultaneously and concurrently for the robbery and drug offenses. See &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Joseph,&lt;/i&gt; 50 F. 3d, at 404; &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Russell,&lt;/i&gt; 2 F. 3d 200, 204 (CA7 1993).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor can we place determinative weight upon the heightened uniformity benefits that Buford contends will result from &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; review. The legal question at issue is a minor, detailed, interstitial question of sentencing law, buried in a judicial interpretation of an application note to a Sentencing Guideline. That question is not a generally recurring, purely legal matter, such as interpreting a set of legal words, say, those of an individual guideline, in order to determine their basic intent. Nor is that question readily resolved by reference to general legal principles and standards alone. Rather, the question at issue grows out of, and is bounded by, case-specific detailed factual circumstances. And the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*66&lt;/span&gt; fact-bound nature of the decision limits the value of appellate court precedent, which may provide only minimal help when other courts consider other procedural circumstances, other state systems, and other crimes. In any event, the Sentencing Commission itself gathers information on the sentences imposed by different courts, it views the sentencing process as a whole, it has developed a broad perspective on sentencing practices throughout the Nation, and it can, by adjusting the Guidelines or the application notes, produce more consistent sentencing results among similarly situated offenders sentenced by different courts. Insofar as greater uniformity is necessary, the Commission can provide it. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Braxton&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 500 U. S. 344, 347-348 (1991) (Congress intended Sentencing Commission to play primary role in resolving conflicts over interpretation of Guidelines).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of the fact-bound nature of the legal decision, the comparatively greater expertise of the District Court, and the limited value of uniform court of appeals precedent, we conclude that the Court of Appeals properly reviewed the District Court's "functional consolidation" decision deferentially. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*25&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*25&lt;/span&gt; Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;John G. Roberts, Jr.,&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Gregory G. Garre&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;JeanneMarie Marshall.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deputy Solicitor General Wallace&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;John A. Artz&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;John S. Artz, Robert P. Renke,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lisa A. Sarkisian.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Kennedy, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temporary road signs with warnings like "Road Work Ahead" or "Left Shoulder Closed" must withstand strong gusts of wind. An inventor named Robert Sarkisian obtained two utility patents for a mechanism built upon two springs (the dual-spring design) to keep these and other outdoor signs upright despite adverse wind conditions. The holder of the now-expired Sarkisian patents, respondent Marketing Displays, Inc. (MDI), established a successful business in the manufacture and sale of sign stands incorporating the patented feature. MDI's stands for road signs were recognizable to buyers and users (it says) because the dual-spring design was visible near the base of the sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*26&lt;/span&gt; This litigation followed after the patents expired and a competitor, TrafFix Devices, Inc.,sold sign stands with a visible spring mechanism that looked like MDI's. MDI and TrafFix products looked alike because they were. When TrafFix started in business, it sent an MDI product abroad to have it reverse engineered, that is to say copied. Complicating matters, TrafFix marketed its sign stands under a name similar to MDI's. MDI used the name "WindMaster," while TrafFix, its new competitor, used "WindBuster."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MDI brought suit under the Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act), 60 Stat. 427, as amended, 15 U. S. C. &#167; 1051 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt;  against TrafFix for trademark infringement (based on the similar names), trade dress infringement (based on the copied dual-spring design), and unfair competition. TrafFix counterclaimed on antitrust theories. After the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan considered cross-motions for summary judgment, MDI prevailed on its trademark claim for the confusing similarity of names and was held not liable on the antitrust counterclaim; and those two rulings, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are not before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are concerned with the trade dress question. The District Court ruled against MDI on its trade dress claim. &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/mied/aADa/marketing-displays-inc-v-traffix-devices-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;971&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;262&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (ED Mich. 1997). After determining that the one element of MDI's trade dress at issue was the dualspring design, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 265, it held that "no reasonable trier of fact could determine that MDI has established secondary meaning" in its alleged trade dress, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 269. In other words, consumers did not associate the look of the dualspring design with MDI. As a second, independent reason to grant summary judgment in favor of TrafFix, the District Court determined the dual-spring design was functional. On this rationale secondary meaning is irrelevant because there can be no trade dress protection in any event. In ruling on the functional aspect of the design, the District Court &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*27&lt;/span&gt; noted that Sixth Circuit precedent indicated that the burden was on MDI to prove that its trade dress was nonfunctional, and not on TrafFix to show that it was functional (a rule since adopted by Congress, see 15 U. S. C. &#167; 1125(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V)), and then went on to consider MDI's arguments that the dual-spring design was subject to trade dress protection. Finding none of MDI's contentions persuasive, the District Court concluded MDI had not "proffered sufficient evidence which would enable a reasonable trier of fact to find that MDI's vertical dual-spring design is &lt;i&gt;non&lt;/i&gt; functional." 971 F. Supp., at 276. Summary judgment was entered against MDI on its trade dress claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the trade dress ruling. 200 F. 3d 929 (1999). The Court of Appeals held the District Court had erred in ruling MDI failed to show a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether it had secondary meaning in its alleged trade dress, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 938, and had erred further in determining that MDI could not prevail in any event because the alleged trade dress was in fact a functional product configuration, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 940. The Court of Appeals suggested the District Court committed legal error by looking only to the dual-spring design when evaluating MDI's trade dress. Basic to its reasoning was the Court of Appeals' observation that it took "little imagination to conceive of a hidden dual-spring mechanism or a tri or quad-spring mechanism that might avoid infringing [MDI's] trade dress." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; The Court of Appeals explained that "[i]f TrafFix or another competitor chooses to use [MDI's] dual-spring design, then it will have to find &lt;i&gt;some other way&lt;/i&gt; to set its sign apart to avoid infringing [MDI's] trade dress." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; It was not sufficient, according to the Court of Appeals, that allowing exclusive use of a particular feature such as the dual-spring design in the guise of trade dress would "hinde[r] competition somewhat." Rather, "[e]xclusive use of a feature must `put competitors at a &lt;i&gt;significant&lt;/i&gt; non-reputation-related disadvantage' before trade &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*28&lt;/span&gt; dress protection is denied on functionality grounds." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt;  (quoting &lt;i&gt;Qualitex Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jacobson Products Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S. 159, 165 (1995)). In its criticism of the District Court's ruling on the trade dress question, the Court of Appeals took note of a split among Courts of Appeals in various other Circuits on the issue whether the existence of an expired utility patent forecloses the possibility of the patentee's claiming trade dress protection in the product's design. 200 F. 3d, at 939. Compare &lt;i&gt;Sunbeam Products, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;West Bend Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 123 F. 3d 246 (CA5 1997) (holding that trade dress protection is not foreclosed), &lt;i&gt;Thomas &amp;amp; Betts Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Panduit Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 138 F. 3d 277 (CA7 1998) (same), and &lt;i&gt;Midwest Industries, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Karavan Trailers, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 175 F. 3d 1356 (CA Fed 1999) (same), with &lt;i&gt;Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Duracraft Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 58 F. 3d 1498, 1500 (CA10 1995) ("Where a product configuration isa significant inventive component of an invention covered by a utility patent . . . it cannot receive trade dress protection"). To resolve the conflict, we granted certiorari. 530 U. S. 1260 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well established that trade dress can be protected under federal law. The design or packaging of a product may acquire a distinctiveness which serves to identify the product with its manufacturer or source; and a design or package which acquires this secondary meaning, assuming other requisites are met, is a trade dress which may not be used in a manner likely to cause confusion as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of the goods. In these respects protection for trade dress exists to promote competition. As we explained just last Term, see &lt;i&gt;Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Samara Brothers, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S. 205 (2000), various Courts of Appeals have allowed claims of trade dress infringement relying on the general provision of the Lanham Act which provides a cause of action to one who is injured when a person uses "any word, term name, symbol, or device, or any &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*29&lt;/span&gt; combination thereof . . . which is likely to cause confusion . . . as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods." 15 U. S. C. &#167; 1125(a)(1)(A). Congress confirmed this statutory protection for trade dress by amending the Lanham Act to recognize the concept. Title 15 U. S. C. &#167; 1125(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V) provides: "In a civil action for trade dress infringement under this chapter for trade dress not registered on the principal register, the person who asserts trade dress protection has the burden of proving that the matter sought to be protected is not functional." This burden of proof gives force to the well-established rule that trade dress protection may not be claimed for product features that are functional. &lt;i&gt;Qualitex, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 164-165; &lt;i&gt;Two Pesos, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Taco Cabana, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 505 U. S. 763, 775 (1992). And in &lt;i&gt;Wal-Mart, supra,&lt;/i&gt; we were careful to caution against misuse or over extension of trade dress. We noted that "product design almost invariably serves purposes other than source identification." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 213.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade dress protection must subsist with the recognition that in many instances there is no prohibition against copying goods and products. In general, unless an intellectual property right such as a patent or copyright protects an item, it will be subject to copying. As the Court has explained, copying is not always discouraged or disfavored by the laws which preserve our competitive economy. &lt;i&gt;Bonito Boats, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Thunder Craft Boats, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 141, 160 (1989). Allowing competitors to copy will have salutary effects in many instances. "Reverse engineering of chemical and mechanical articles in the public domain often leads to significant advances in technology." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principal question in this case is the effect of an expired patent on a claim of trade dress infringement. A prior patent, we conclude, has vital significance in resolving the trade dress claim. A utility patent is strong evidence that the features therein claimed are functional. If trade dress protection is sought for those features the strong evidence &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*30&lt;/span&gt; of functionality based on the previous patent adds great weight to the statutory presumption that features are deemed functional until proved otherwise by the party seeking trade dress protection. Where the expired patent claimed the features in question, one who seeks to establish trade dress protection must carry the heavy burden of showing that the feature is not functional, for instance by showing that it is merely an ornamental, incidental, or arbitrary aspect of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case before us, the central advance claimed in the expired utility patents (the Sarkisian patents) is the dualspring design; and the dual-spring design is the essential feature of the trade dress MDI now seeks to establish and to protect. The rule we have explained bars the trade dress claim, for MDI did not, and cannot, carry the burden of overcoming the strong evidentiary inference of functionality based on the disclosure of the dual-spring design in the claims of the expired patents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dual springs shown in the Sarkisian patents were well apart (at either end of a frame for holding a rectangular sign when one full side is the base) while the dual springs at issue here are close together (in a frame designed to hold a sign by one of its corners). As the District Court recognized, this makes little difference. The point is that the springs are necessary to the operation of the device. The fact that the springs in this very different-looking device fall within the claims of the patents is illustrated by MDI's own position in earlier litigation. In the late 1970's, MDI engaged in a long-running intellectual property battle with a company known as Winn-Proof. Although the precise claims of the Sarkisian patents cover sign stands with springs "spaced apart," U. S. Patent No. 3,646,696, col. 4; U. S. Patent No. 3,662,482, col. 4, the Winn-Proof sign stands (with springs much like the sign stands at issue here) were found to infringe the patents by the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, and the Court of Appeals for the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*31&lt;/span&gt; Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment. &lt;i&gt;Sarkisian&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;WinnProof Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 697 F. 2d 1313 (1983). Although the WinnProof traffic sign stand (with dual springs close together) did not appear, then, to infringe the literal terms of the patent claims (which called for "spaced apart" springs), the WinnProof sign stand was found to infringe the patents under the doctrine of equivalents, which allows a finding of patent infringement even when the accused product does not fall within the literal terms of the claims. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1321-1322; see generally &lt;i&gt;Warner-Jenkinson Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hilton Davis Chemical Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 520 U. S. 17 (1997). In light of this past ruling&#151;a ruling procured at MDI's own insistence&#151;it must be concluded the products here at issue would have been covered by the claims of the expired patents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rationale for the rule that the disclosure of a feature in the claims of a utility patent constitutes strong evidence of functionality is well illustrated in this case. The dual-spring design serves the important purpose of keeping the sign upright even in heavy wind conditions; and, as confirmed by the statements in the expired patents, it does so in a unique and useful manner. As the specification of one of the patents recites, prior art "devices, in practice, will topple under the force of a strong wind." U. S. Patent No. 3,662,482, col. 1. The dual-spring design allows sign stands to resist toppling in strong winds. Using a dual-spring design rather than a single spring achieves important operational advantages. For example, the specifications of the patents note that the "use of a pair of springs . . . as opposed to the use of a single spring to support the frame structure prevents canting or twisting of the sign around a vertical axis," and that, if not prevented, twisting "may cause damage to the spring structure and may result in tipping of the device." U. S. Patent No. 3,646,696, col. 3. In the course of patent prosecution, it was said that "[t]he use of a pair of spring connections as opposed to a single spring connection . . . forms an important part of this combination" because it &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*32&lt;/span&gt; "forc[es] the sign frame to tip along the longitudinal axis of the elongated ground-engaging members." App. 218. The dual-spring design affects the cost of the device as well; it was acknowledged that the device "could use three springs but this would unnecessarily increase the cost of the device." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 217. These statements made in the patent applications and in the course of procuring the patents demonstrate the functionality of the design. MDI does not assert that any of these representations are mistaken or inaccurate, and this is further strong evidence of the functionality of the dual-spring design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In finding for MDI on the trade dress issue the Court of Appeals gave insufficient recognition to the importance of the expired utility patents, and their evidentiary significance, in establishing the functionality of the device. The error likely was caused by its misinterpretation of trade dress principles in other respects. As we have noted, even if there has been no previous utility patent the party asserting trade dress has the burden to establish the nonfunctionality of alleged trade dress features. MDI could not meet this burden. Discussing trademarks, we have said "`[i]n general terms, a product feature is functional,' and cannot serve as a trademark, `if it is essential to the use or purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or quality of the article.' " &lt;i&gt;Qualitex,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S., at 165 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Inwood Laboratories, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ives Laboratories, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 456 U. S. 844, 850, n. 10 (1982)). Expanding upon the meaning of this phrase, we have observed that a functional feature is one the "exclusive use of [which] would put competitors at a significant nonreputation-related disadvantage." 514 U. S., at 165. The Court of Appeals in the instant case seemed to interpret this language to mean that a necessary test for functionality is "whether the particular product configuration is a competitive necessity." 200 F. 3d, at 940. See also &lt;i&gt;Vornado,&lt;/i&gt; 58 F. 3d, at 1507 ("Functionality, by contrast, has been defined &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*33&lt;/span&gt; both by our circuit, and more recently by the Supreme Court, in terms of competitive need"). This was incorrect as a comprehensive definition. As explained in &lt;i&gt;Qualitex, supra,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Inwood, supra,&lt;/i&gt; a feature is also functional when it is essential to the use or purpose of the device or when it affects the cost or quality of the device. The &lt;i&gt;Qualitex&lt;/i&gt; decision did not purport to displace this traditional rule. Instead, it quoted the rule as &lt;i&gt;Inwood&lt;/i&gt; had set it forth. It is proper to inquire into a "significant non-reputation-related disadvantage" in cases of esthetic functionality, the question involved in &lt;i&gt;Qualitex.&lt;/i&gt; Where the design is functional under the &lt;i&gt;Inwood&lt;/i&gt; formulation there is no need to proceed further to consider if there is a competitive necessity for the feature. In &lt;i&gt;Qualitex,&lt;/i&gt; by contrast, esthetic functionality was the central question, there having been no indication that the green-gold color of the laundry press pad had any bearing on the use or purpose of the product or its cost or quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court has allowed trade dress protection to certain product features that are inherently distinctive. &lt;i&gt;Two Pesos,&lt;/i&gt;  505 U. S., at 774. In &lt;i&gt;Two Pesos,&lt;/i&gt; however, the Court at the outset made the explicit analytic assumption that the trade dress features in question (decorations and other features to evoke a Mexican theme in a restaurant) were not functional. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 767, n. 6. The trade dress in those cases did not bar competitors from copying functional product design features. In the instant case, beyond serving the purpose of informing consumers that the sign stands are made by MDI (assuming it does so), the dual-spring design provides a unique and useful mechanism to resist the force of the wind. Functionality having been established, whether MDI's dual-spring design has acquired secondary meaning need not be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need, furthermore, to engage, as did the Court of Appeals, in speculation about other design possibilities, such as using three or four springs which might serve the same purpose. 200 F. 3d, at 940. Here, the functionality of the spring design means that competitors need not explore &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*34&lt;/span&gt; whether other spring juxtapositions might be used. The dual-spring design is not an arbitrary flourish in the configuration of MDI's product; it is the reason the device works. Other designs need not be attempted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the dual-spring design is functional, it is unnecessary for competitors to explore designs to hide the springs, say, by using a box or framework to cover them, as suggested by the Court of Appeals. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; The dual-spring design assures the user the device will work. If buyers are assured the product serves its purpose by seeing the operative mechanism that in itself serves an important market need. It would be at cross-purposes to those objectives, and something of a paradox, were we to require the manufacturer to conceal the very item the user seeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a case where a manufacturer seeks to protect arbitrary, incidental, or ornamental aspects of features of a product found in the patent claims, such as arbitrary curves in the legs or an ornamental pattern painted on the springs, a different result might obtain. There the manufacturer could perhaps prove that those aspects do not serve a purpose within the terms of the utility patent. The inquiry into whether such features, asserted to be trade dress, are functional by reason of their inclusion in the claims of an expired utility patent could be aided by going beyond the claims and examining the patent and its prosecution history to see if the feature in question is shown as a useful part of the invention. No such claim is made here, however. MDI in essence seeks protection for the dual-spring design alone. The asserted trade dress consists simply of the dual-spring design, four legs, a base, an upright, and a sign. MDI has pointed to nothing arbitrary about the components of its device or the way they are assembled. The Lanham Act does not exist to reward manufacturers for their innovation in creating a particular device; that is the purpose of the patent law and its period of exclusivity. The Lanham Act, furthermore, does not protect trade dress in a functional design simply &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*35&lt;/span&gt; because an investment has been made to encourage the public to associate a particular functional feature with a single manufacturer or seller. The Court of Appeals erred in viewing MDI as possessing the right to exclude competitors from using a design identical to MDI's and to require those competitors to adopt a different design simply to avoid copying it. MDI cannot gain the exclusive right to produce sign stands using the dual-spring design by asserting that consumers associate it with the look of the invention itself. Whether a utility patent has expired or there has been no utility patent at all, a product design which has a particular appearance may be functional because it is "essential to the use or purpose of the article" or "affects the cost or quality of the article." &lt;i&gt;Inwood,&lt;/i&gt; 456 U. S., at 850, n. 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TrafFix and some of its &lt;i&gt;amici&lt;/i&gt; argue that the Patent Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, &#167; 8, cl. 8, of its own force, prohibits the holder of an expired utility patent from claiming trade dress protection. Brief for Petitioner 33-36; Brief for Panduit Corp. as &lt;i&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 3; Brief for Malla Pollack as &lt;i&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 2. We need not resolve this question. If, despite the rule that functional features may not be the subject of trade dress protection, a case arises in which trade dress becomes the practical equivalent of an expired utility patent, that will be time enough to consider the matter. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;No. 00-1028.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;United States Supreme Court.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided March 19, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF OHIO
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*19&lt;/span&gt; Per Curiam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court of Ohio here held that a witness who denies all culpability does not have a valid Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Because our precedents dictate that the privilege protects the innocent as well as the guilty, and that the facts here are sufficient to sustain a claim of privilege, we grant the petition for certiorari and reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent was charged with involuntary manslaughter in connection with the death of his 2-month-old son Alex. The coroner testified at trial that Alex died from "shaken baby syndrome," the result of child abuse. He estimated that Alex's injury most likely occurred minutes before the child stopped breathing. Alex died two days later when he was removed from life support. Evidence produced at trial revealed that Alex had a broken rib and a broken leg at the time of his death. His twin brother Derek, who was also examined, had several broken ribs. Respondent had been alone with Alex for half an hour immediately before Alex stopped breathing. Respondent's experts testified that Alex could have been injured several hours before his respiratory arrest. Alex was in the care of the family's babysitter, Susan Batt, at that time. Batt had cared for the children during the day for about two weeks prior to Alex's death. The defense theory was that Batt, not respondent, was the culpable party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batt informed the court in advance of testifying that she intended to assert her Fifth Amendment privilege. At the State's request, the trial court granted her transactional immunity from prosecution pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &#167; 2945.44 (1999). She then testified to the jury that she had refused to testify without a grant of immunity on the advice of counsel, although she had done nothing wrong. Batt denied any involvement in Alex's death. She testified that she had never shaken Alex or his brother at any time, specifically on the day Alex suffered respiratory arrest. She said she &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*19&lt;/span&gt; was unaware of and had nothing to do with the other injuries to both children. The jury found respondent guilty of involuntary manslaughter, and he appealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals of Ohio, Sixth District, reversed respondent's conviction on grounds not relevant to our decision here. The Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed the reversal, on the alternative ground that Batt had no valid Fifth Amendment privilege and that the trial court's grant of immunity under &#167; 2945.44 was therefore unlawful.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; 89 Ohio St. 3d 342, 358, 731 N. E. 2d 662, 677 (2000). The court found that the wrongful grant of immunity prejudiced respondent, because it effectively told the jury that Batt did not cause Alex's injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court recognized that the privilege against selfincrimination applies where a witness' answers "could reasonably `furnish a link in the chain of evidence' " against him, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 352, 731 N. E. 2d, at 673 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Hoffman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 341 U. S. 479, 486 (1951)). &lt;i&gt;Hoffman,&lt;/i&gt; it noted, requires the trial court to determine whether the witness has correctly asserted the privilege, and to order the witness to answer questions if the witness is mistaken about the danger of incrimination. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; The court faulted the trial judge for failing to question sufficiently Batt's assertion of the privilege. It noted that the Court of Appeals, in finding a valid privilege, failed to consider the prosecutor's suggestion that Batt's testimony would not incriminate her, and Batt's denial of involvement in Alex's abuse when questioned by the Children's Services Board. The court held that "Susan Batt's &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*20&lt;/span&gt; [trial] testimony did not incriminate her, because she denied &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; involvement in the abuse. Thus, she did not have a valid Fifth Amendment privilege." 89 Ohio St. 3d, at 355, 731 N. E. 2d, at 675 (emphasis in original). The court emphasized that the defense's theory of Batt's guilt was not grounds for a grant of immunity, "when the witness continues to deny any self-incriminating conduct." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court of Ohio's decision that Batt was wrongly granted immunity under &#167; 2945.44 (and consequently, that reversal of respondent's conviction was required) rested on the court's determination that Batt did not have a valid Fifth Amendment privilege. In discussing the contours of that privilege, the court relied on our precedents. We have observed that "this Court retains a role when a state court's interpretation of state law has been influenced by an accompanying interpretation of federal law." &lt;i&gt;Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wold Engineering, P. C.,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 138, 152 (1984). The decision at issue "fairly appears . . . to be interwoven with the federal law," and no adequate and independent state ground is clear from the face of the opinion. &lt;i&gt;Michigan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Long,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S. 1032, 1040-1041 (1983). We have jurisdiction over a statecourt judgment that rests, as a threshold matter, on a determination of federal law. See &lt;i&gt;Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Thompson,&lt;/i&gt; 478 U. S. 804, 816 (1986) ("[T]his Court retains power to review the decision of a federal issue in a state cause of action"); &lt;i&gt;St. Louis, I. M. &amp;amp; S. R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Taylor,&lt;/i&gt;  210 U. S. 281, 293-294 (1908).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fifth Amendment provides that "[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself." U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. As the Supreme Court of Ohio acknowledged, this privilege not only extends "to answers that would in themselves support a conviction . . . but likewise embraces those which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant." &lt;i&gt;Hoffman,&lt;/i&gt; 341 U. S., at 486. "[I]t need only be evident from the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*21&lt;/span&gt; implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 486-487.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have held that the privilege's protection extends only to witnesses who have "reasonable cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 486. That inquiry is for the court; the witness' assertion does not by itself establish the risk of incrimination. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; A danger of "imaginary and unsubstantial character" will not suffice. &lt;i&gt;Mason&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 244 U. S. 362, 366 (1917). But we have never held, as the Supreme Court of Ohio did, that the privilege is unavailable to those who claim innocence. To the contrary, we have emphasized that one of the Fifth Amendment's "basic functions . . . is to protect &lt;i&gt;innocent&lt;/i&gt; men . . . `who otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.' " &lt;i&gt;Grunewald&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 353 U. S. 391, 421 (1957) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Slochower&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Board of Higher Ed. of New York City,&lt;/i&gt; 350 U. S. 551, 557-558 (1956)) (emphasis in original). In &lt;i&gt;Grunewald,&lt;/i&gt; we recognized that truthful responses of an innocent witness, as well as those of a wrongdoer, may provide the government with incriminating evidence from the speaker's own mouth. 353 U. S., at 421-422.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court of Ohio's determination that Batt did not have a valid Fifth Amendment privilege because she denied any involvement in the abuse of the children clearly conflicts with &lt;i&gt;Hoffman&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Grunewald.&lt;/i&gt; Batt had "reasonable cause" to apprehend danger from her answers if questioned at respondent's trial. &lt;i&gt;Hoffman, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 486. Batt spent extended periods of time alone with Alex and his brother in the weeks immediately preceding discovery of their injuries. She was with Alex within the potential timeframe of the fatal trauma. The defense's theory of the case was that Batt, not respondent, was responsible for Alex's death and his brother's uncharged injuries. In this setting, it was reasonable for Batt to fear that answers to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*22&lt;/span&gt; possible questions might tend to incriminate her. Batt therefore had a valid Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not, of course, address the question whether immunity from suit under &#167; 2945.44 was appropriate. Because the Supreme Court of Ohio mistakenly held that the witness' assertion of innocence deprived her of her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the court's judgment is reversed, and this case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &#167; 2945.44 (1999) states in pertinent part: "In any criminal proceeding . . . if a witness refuses to answer or produce information &lt;i&gt;on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination,&lt;/i&gt; the court of common pleas . . . unless it finds that to do so would not further the administration of justice, shall compel the witness to answer or produce the information, if . . . [the prosecuting attorney so requests and] . . . [t]he court . . . informs the witness that by answering, or producing the information he will receive [transactional] immunity . . .."

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*69&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*69&lt;/span&gt; Stevens, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which O'Connor, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined. Kennedy, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 86. Scalia, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Thomas, J., joined as to Part II, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 91.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Priscilla J. Smith&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioners. With her on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Simon Heller, Lynn Paltrow, Susan Frietsche, David S. Cohen, Susan Dunn, David Rudovsky,&lt;/i&gt;  and &lt;i&gt;Seth Kreimer.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Robert H. Hood&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Barbara Wynne Showers&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mary Agnes Hood Craig.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we must decide whether a state hospital's performance of a diagnostic test to obtain evidence of a patient's criminal conduct for law enforcement purposes is an &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*70&lt;/span&gt; unreasonable search if the patient has not consented to the procedure. More narrowly, the question is whether the interest in using the threat of criminal sanctions to deter pregnant women from using cocaine can justify a departure from the general rule that an official nonconsensual search is unconstitutional if not authorized by a valid warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 1988, staff members at the public hospital operated in the city of Charleston by the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) became concerned about an apparent increase in the use of cocaine by patients who were receiving prenatal treatment.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; In response to this perceived increase, as of April 1989, MUSC began to order drug screens to be performed on urine samples from maternity patients who were suspected of using cocaine. If a patient tested positive, she was then referred by MUSC staff to the county substance abuse commission for counseling and treatment. However, despite the referrals, the incidence of cocaine use among the patients at MUSC did not appear to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some four months later, Nurse Shirley Brown, the case manager for the MUSC obstetrics department, heard a news broadcast reporting that the police in Greenville, South Carolina, were arresting pregnant users of cocaine on the theory that such use harmed the fetus and was therefore child abuse.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Nurse Brown discussed the story with MUSC's general counsel, Joseph C. Good, Jr., who then contacted &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*71&lt;/span&gt; Charleston Solicitor Charles Condon in order to offer MUSC's cooperation in prosecuting mothers whose children tested positive for drugs at birth.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After receiving Good's letter, Solicitor Condon took the first steps in developing the policy at issue in this case. He organized the initial meetings, decided who would participate, and issued the invitations, in which he described his plan to prosecute women who tested positive for cocaine while pregnant. The task force that Condon formed included representatives of MUSC, the police, the County Substance Abuse Commission and the Department of Social Services. Their deliberations led to MUSC's adoption of a 12-page document entitled "POLICY M-7," dealing with the subject of "Management of Drug Abuse During Pregnancy." App. to Pet. for Cert. A-53.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three pages of Policy M-7 set forth the procedure to be followed by the hospital staff to "identify/assist pregnant patients suspected of drug abuse." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at A-53 to A-56. The first section, entitled the "Identification of Drug Abusers," provided that a patient should be tested for cocaine through a urine drug screen if she met one or more of nine criteria.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; It also stated that a chain of custody should &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*72&lt;/span&gt; be followed when obtaining and testing urine samples, presumably to make sure that the results could be used in subsequent criminal proceedings. The policy also provided for education and referral to a substance abuse clinic for patients who tested positive. Most important, it added the threat of law enforcement intervention that "provided the necessary `leverage' to make the [p]olicy effective." Brief for Respondents 8. That threat was, as respondents candidly acknowledge, essential to the program's success in getting women into treatment and keeping them there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threat of law enforcement involvement was set forth in two protocols, the first dealing with the identification of drug use during pregnancy, and the second with identification of drug use after labor. Under the latter protocol, the police were to be notified without delay and the patient promptly arrested. Under the former, after the initial positive drug test, the police were to be notified (and the patient arrested) only if the patient tested positive for cocaine a second time or if she missed an appointment with a substance abuse counselor.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; In 1990, however, the policy was modified at the behest of the solicitor's office to give the patient who tested positive during labor, like the patient who tested positive during a prenatal care visit, an opportunity to avoid arrest by consenting to substance abuse treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last six pages of the policy contained forms for the patients to sign, as well as procedures for the police to follow when a patient was arrested. The policy also prescribed in detail the precise offenses with which a woman could be charged, depending on the stage of her pregnancy. If the pregnancy was 27 weeks or less, the patient was to be charged with simple possession. If it was 28 weeks or more, she was to be charged with possession and distribution to a person under the age of 18&#151;in this case, the fetus. If she &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*73&lt;/span&gt; delivered "while testing positive for illegal drugs," she was also to be charged with unlawful neglect of a child. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-62. Under the policy, the police were instructed to interrogate the arrestee in order "to ascertain the identity of the subject who provided illegal drugs to the suspect." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at A-63. Other than the provisions describing the substance abuse treatment to be offered to women who tested positive, the policy made no mention of any change in the prenatal care of such patients, nor did it prescribe any special treatment for the newborns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners are 10 women who received obstetrical care at MUSC and who were arrested after testing positive for cocaine. Four of them were arrested during the initial implementation of the policy; they were not offered the opportunity to receive drug treatment as an alternative to arrest. The others were arrested after the policy was modified in 1990; they either failed to comply with the terms of the drug treatment program or tested positive for a second time. Respondents include the city of Charleston, law enforcement officials who helped develop and enforce the policy, and representatives of MUSC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners' complaint challenged the validity of the policy under various theories, including the claim that warrantless and nonconsensual drug tests conducted for criminal investigatory purposes were unconstitutional searches. Respondents advanced two principal defenses to the constitutional claim: (1) that, as a matter of fact, petitioners had consented to the searches; and (2) that, as a matter of law, the searches were reasonable, even absent consent, because they were justified by special non-law-enforcement purposes. The District Court rejected the second defense because the searches in question "were not done by the medical university for independent purposes. [Instead,] the police came in and there was an agreement reached that the positive &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*74&lt;/span&gt; screens would be shared with the police." App. 1248-1249. Accordingly, the District Court submitted the factual defense to the jury with instructions that required a verdict in favor of petitioners unless the jury found consent.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; The jury found for respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners appealed, arguing that the evidence was not sufficient to support the jury's consent finding. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, but without reaching the question of consent. 186 F. 3d 469 (1999). Disagreeing with the District Court, the majority of the appellate panel held that the searches were reasonable as a matter of law under our line of cases recognizing that "special needs" may, in certain exceptional circumstances, justify a search policy designed to serve non-law-enforcement ends.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*75&lt;/span&gt; On the understanding "that MUSC personnel conducted the urine drug screens for medical purposes wholly independent of an intent to aid law enforcement efforts,"&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 477, the majority applied the balancing test used in &lt;i&gt;Treasury Employees&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Von Raab,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 656 (1989), and &lt;i&gt;Vernonia School Dist. 47J&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Acton,&lt;/i&gt; 515 U. S. 646 (1995), and concluded that the interest in curtailing the pregnancy complications and medical costs associated with maternal cocaine use outweighed what the majority termed a minimal intrusion on the privacy of the patients. In dissent, Judge Blake concluded that the "special needs" doctrine should not apply and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*76&lt;/span&gt; that the evidence of consent was insufficient to sustain the jury's verdict. 186 F. 3d, at 487-488.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We granted certiorari, 528 U. S. 1187 (2000), to review the appellate court's holding on the "special needs" issue. Because we do not reach the question of the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to consent, we necessarily assume for purposes of our decision&#151;as did the Court of Appeals&#151;that the searches were conducted without the informed consent of the patients. We conclude that the judgment should be reversed and the case remanded for a decision on the consent issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because MUSC is a state hospital, the members of its staff are government actors, subject to the strictures of the Fourth Amendment. &lt;i&gt;New Jersey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;T. L. O.,&lt;/i&gt; 469 U. S. 325, 335-337 (1985). Moreover, the urine tests conducted by those staff members were indisputably searches within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. &lt;i&gt;Skinner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Railway Labor Executives' Assn.,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 602, 617 (1989).&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals concluded that any of the nine criteria used to identify the women to be searched provided either probable cause to believe that they were using cocaine, or even the basis for a reasonable suspicion of such use. Rather, the District Court and the Court of Appeals viewed the case as one involving MUSC's right &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*77&lt;/span&gt; to conduct searches without warrants or probable cause.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; Furthermore, given the posture in which the case comes to us, we must assume for purposes of our decision that the tests were performed without the informed consent of the patients.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the hospital seeks to justify its authority to conduct drug tests and to turn the results over to law enforcement agents without the knowledge or consent of the patients, this case differs from the four previous cases in which we have considered whether comparable drug tests "fit within the closely guarded category of constitutionally permissible suspicionless searches." &lt;i&gt;Chandler&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Miller,&lt;/i&gt; 520 U. S. 305, 309 (1997). In three of those cases, we sustained drug tests for railway employees involved in train accidents, &lt;i&gt;Skinner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Railway Labor Executives' Assn.,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 602 (1989), for United States Customs Service employees seeking promotion to certain sensitive positions, &lt;i&gt;Treasury Employees&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Von Raab,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 656 (1989), and for high school students participating in interscholastic sports, &lt;i&gt;Vernonia School Dist. 47J&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Acton,&lt;/i&gt; 515 U. S. 646 (1995). In the fourth case, we struck down such testing for candidates for designated state offices as unreasonable. &lt;i&gt;Chandler&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Miller,&lt;/i&gt; 520 U. S. 305 (1997).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*78&lt;/span&gt; In each of those cases, we employed a balancing test that weighed the intrusion on the individual's interest in privacy against the "special needs" that supported the program. As an initial matter, we note that the invasion of privacy in this case is far more substantial than in those cases. In the previous four cases, there was no misunderstanding about the purpose of the test or the potential use of the test results, and there were protections against the dissemination of the results to third parties.&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt; The use of an adverse test result to disqualify one from eligibility for a particular benefit, such as a promotion or an opportunity to participate in an extracurricular activity, involves a less serious intrusion on privacy than the unauthorized dissemination of such results to third parties. The reasonable expectation of privacy enjoyed by the typical patient undergoing diagnostic tests in a hospital is that the results of those tests will not be shared with nonmedical personnel without her consent. See Brief for American Medical Association as &lt;i&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 11; Brief for American Public Health Association et al. as &lt;i&gt;Amici Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 6, 17-19.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt; In none of our prior cases was there any intrusion upon that kind of expectation.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*79&lt;/span&gt; The critical difference between those four drug-testing cases and this one, however, lies in the nature of the "special need" asserted as justification for the warrantless searches. In each of those earlier cases, the "special need" that was advanced as a justification for the absence of a warrant or individualized suspicion was one divorced from the State's general interest in law enforcement.&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt; This point was emphasized &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*80&lt;/span&gt; both in the majority opinions sustaining the programs in the first three cases,&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt; as well as in the dissent in the &lt;i&gt;Chandler&lt;/i&gt; case.&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt; In this case, however, the central and indispensable feature of the policy from its inception was the use of law enforcement to coerce the patients into substance abuse treatment. This fact distinguishes this case from circumstances in which physicians or psychologists, in the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*81&lt;/span&gt; course of ordinary medical procedures aimed at helping the patient herself, come across information that under rules of law or ethics is subject to reporting requirements, which no one has challenged here. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, American Medical Association, PolicyFinder, Current Opinions E-5.05 (2000) (requiring reporting where "a patient threatens to inflict serious bodily harm to another person or to him or herself and there is a reasonable probability that the patient may carry out the threat"); Ark. Code Ann. &#167; 12-12-602 (1999) (requiring reporting of intentionally inflicted knife or gunshot wounds); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &#167; 13-3620 (Supp. 2000) (requiring "any . . . person having responsibility for the care or treatment of children" to report suspected abuse or neglect to a peace officer or child protection agency).&lt;sup&gt;[18]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondents argue in essence that their ultimate purpose&#151;namely, protecting the health of both mother and child&#151;is a beneficent one. In &lt;i&gt;Chandler,&lt;/i&gt; however, we did not simply accept the State's invocation of a "special need." Instead, we carried out a "close review" of the scheme at issue before concluding that the need in question was not "special," as that term has been defined in our cases. 520 U. S., at 322. In this case, a review of the M-7 policy plainly reveals that the purpose actually served by the MUSC searches "is ultimately indistinguishable from the general interest in crime control." &lt;i&gt;Indianapolis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Edmond,&lt;/i&gt; 531 U. S. 32, 44 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In looking to the programmatic purpose, we consider all the available evidence in order to determine the relevant primary purpose. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 45-47. In this case, as &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*82&lt;/span&gt; Judge Blake put it in her dissent below, "it . . . is clear from the record that an initial and continuing focus of the policy was on the arrest and prosecution of drug-abusing mothers . . . ." 186 F. 3d, at 484. Tellingly, the document codifying the policy incorporates the police's operational guidelines. It devotes its attention to the chain of custody, the range of possible criminal charges, and the logistics of police notification and arrests. Nowhere, however, does the document discuss different courses of medical treatment for either mother or infant, aside from treatment for the mother's addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, throughout the development and application of the policy, the Charleston prosecutors and police were extensively involved in the day-to-day administration of the policy. Police and prosecutors decided who would receive the reports of positive drug screens and what information would be included with those reports. App. 78-80, 145-146, 1058-1060. Law enforcement officials also helped determine the procedures to be followed when performing the screens.&lt;sup&gt;[19]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1052-1053. See also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 26-27, 945. In the course of the policy's administration, they had access to Nurse Brown's medical files on the women who tested positive, routinely attended the substance abuse team's meetings, and regularly received copies of team documents discussing the women's progress. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 122-124, 609-610. Police took pains to coordinate the timing and circumstances of the arrests with MUSC staff, and, in particular, Nurse Brown. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1057-1058.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the ultimate goal of the program may well have been to get the women in question into substance abuse treatment &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*83&lt;/span&gt; and off of drugs, the immediate objective of the searches was to generate evidence &lt;i&gt;for law enforcement purposes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[20]&lt;/sup&gt; in order to reach that goal.&lt;sup&gt;[21]&lt;/sup&gt; The threat of law enforcement &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*84&lt;/span&gt; may ultimately have been intended as a means to an end, but the direct and primary purpose of MUSC's policy was to ensure the use of those means. In our opinion, this distinction is critical. Because law enforcement involvement always serves some broader social purpose or objective, under respondents' view, virtually any nonconsensual suspicionless search could be immunized under the special needs doctrine by defining the search solely in terms of its ultimate, rather than immediate, purpose.&lt;sup&gt;[22]&lt;/sup&gt; Such an approach is inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment. Given the primary purpose of the Charleston program, which was to use the threat of arrest and prosecution in order to force women into treatment, and given the extensive involvement of law enforcement officials at every stage of the policy, this case simply does not fit within the closely guarded category of "special needs."&lt;sup&gt;[23]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that positive test results were turned over to the police does not merely provide a basis for distinguishing our prior cases applying the "special needs" balancing approach to the determination of drug use. It also provides an affirmative reason for enforcing the strictures of the Fourth Amendment. While state hospital employees, like other citizens, may have a duty to provide the police with evidence &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*85&lt;/span&gt; of criminal conduct that they inadvertently acquire in the course of routine treatment, when they undertake to obtain such evidence from their patients &lt;i&gt;for the specific purpose of incriminating those patients,&lt;/i&gt; they have a special obligation to make sure that the patients are fully informed about their constitutional rights, as standards of knowing waiver require.&lt;sup&gt;[24]&lt;/sup&gt; Cf. &lt;i&gt;Miranda&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arizona,&lt;/i&gt; 384 U. S. 436 (1966).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As respondents have repeatedly insisted, their motive was benign rather than punitive. Such a motive, however, cannot justify a departure from Fourth Amendment protections, given the pervasive involvement of law enforcement with the development and application of the MUSC policy. The stark &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*86&lt;/span&gt; and unique fact that characterizes this case is that Policy M-7 was designed to obtain evidence of criminal conduct by the tested patients that would be turned over to the police and that could be admissible in subsequent criminal prosecutions. While respondents are correct that drug abuse both was and is a serious problem, "the gravity of the threat alone cannot be dispositive of questions concerning what means law enforcement officers may employ to pursue a given purpose." &lt;i&gt;Indianapolis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Edmond,&lt;/i&gt; 531 U. S., at 42-43. The Fourth Amendment's general prohibition against nonconsensual, warrantless, and suspicionless searches necessarily applies to such a policy. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chandler,&lt;/i&gt; 520 U. S., at 308; &lt;i&gt;Skinner,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S., at 619.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that the search procedure in issue cannot be sustained under the Fourth Amendment. My reasons for this conclusion differ somewhat from those set forth by the Court, however, leading to this separate opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court does not dispute that the search policy at some level serves special needs, beyond those of ordinary law enforcement, such as the need to protect the health of mother and child when a pregnant mother uses cocaine. Instead, the majority characterizes these special needs as the "ultimate goal[s]" of the policy, as distinguished from the policy's "immediate purpose," the collection of evidence of drug use, which, the Court reasons, is the appropriate inquiry for the special needs analysis. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 81-84.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority views its distinction between the ultimate goal and immediate purpose of the policy as critical to its &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*87&lt;/span&gt; analysis. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 83-84. The distinction the Court makes, however, lacks foundation in our special needs cases. All of our special needs cases have turned upon what the majority terms the policy's ultimate goal. For example, in &lt;i&gt;Skinner&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Railway Labor Executives' Assn.,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 602 (1989), had we employed the majority's distinction, we would have identified as the relevant need the collection of evidence of drug and alcohol use by railway employees. Instead, we identified the relevant need as "[t]he Government's interest in regulating the conduct of railroad employees to ensure [railroad] safety." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 620. In &lt;i&gt;Treasury Employees&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Von Raab,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 656 (1989), the majority's distinction should have compelled us to isolate the relevant need as the gathering of evidence of drug abuse by would-be drug interdiction officers. Instead, the special needs the Court identified were the necessities "to deter drug use among those eligible for promotion to sensitive positions within the [United States Customs] Service and to prevent the promotion of drug users to those positions." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 666. In &lt;i&gt;Vernonia School Dist. 47J&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Acton,&lt;/i&gt; 515 U. S. 646 (1995), the majority's distinction would have required us to identify the immediate purpose of gathering evidence of drug use by student-athletes as the relevant "need" for purposes of the special needs analysis. Instead, we sustained the policy as furthering what today's majority would have termed the policy's ultimate goal: "[d]eterring drug use by our Nation's schoolchildren," and particularly by student-athletes, because "the risk of immediate physical harm to the drug user or those with whom he is playing his sport is particularly high." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 661-662.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unsurprising that in our prior cases we have concentrated on what the majority terms a policy's ultimate goal, rather than its proximate purpose. By very definition, in almost every case the immediate purpose of a search policy will be to obtain evidence. The circumstance that a particular search, like all searches, is designed to collect evidence &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*88&lt;/span&gt; of some sort reveals nothing about the need it serves. Put a different way, although procuring evidence is the immediate result of a successful search, until today that procurement has not been identified as the special need which justifies the search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the majority's reasoning seems incorrect in the respects just discussed, I agree with the Court that the search policy cannot be sustained. As the majority demonstrates and well explains, there was substantial law enforcement involvement in the policy from its inception. None of our special needs precedents has sanctioned the routine inclusion of law enforcement, both in the design of the policy and in using arrests, either threatened or real, to implement the system designed for the special needs objectives. The special needs cases we have decided do not sustain the active use of law enforcement, including arrest and prosecutions, as an integral part of a program which seeks to achieve legitimate, civil objectives. The traditional warrant and probable-cause requirements are waived in our previous cases on the explicit assumption that the evidence obtained in the search is not intended to be used for law enforcement purposes. Most of those tested for drug use under the policy at issue here were not brought into direct contact with law enforcement. This does not change the fact, however, that, as a systemic matter, law enforcement was a part of the implementation of the search policy in each of its applications. Every individual who tested positive was given a letter explaining the policy not from the hospital but from the solicitor's office. Everyone who tested positive was told a second positive test or failure to undergo substance abuse treatment would result in arrest and prosecution. As the Court holds, the hospital acted, in some respects, as an institutional arm of law enforcement for purposes of the policy. Under these circumstances, while the policy may well have served legitimate needs unrelated to law enforcement, it had &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*89&lt;/span&gt; as well a penal character with a far greater connection to law enforcement than other searches sustained under our special needs rationale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my view, it is necessary and prudent to be explicit in explaining the limitations of today's decision. The beginning point ought to be to acknowledge the legitimacy of the State's interest in fetal life and of the grave risk to the life and health of the fetus, and later the child, caused by cocaine ingestion. Infants whose mothers abuse cocaine during pregnancy are born with a wide variety of physical and neurological abnormalities. See Chiriboga, Brust, Bateman, &amp;amp; Hauser, Dose-Response Effect of Fetal Cocaine Exposure on Newborn Neurologic Function, 103 Pediatrics 79 (1999) (finding that, compared with unexposed infants, cocaineexposed infants experienced higher rates of intrauterine growth retardation, smaller head circumference, global hypertonia, coarse tremor, and extensor leg posture). Prenatal exposure to cocaine can also result in developmental problems which persist long after birth. See Arendt, Angelopoulos, Salvator, &amp;amp; Singer, Motor Development of Cocaine-exposed Children at Age Two Years, 103 Pediatrics 86 (1999) (concluding that, at two years of age, children who were exposed to cocaine in utero exhibited significantly less fine and gross motor development than those not so exposed); Chasnoff et al., Prenatal Exposure to Cocaine and Other Drugs: Outcome at Four to Six Years, 846 Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 314, 319-320 (J. Harvey and B. Kosofsky eds. 1998) (finding that 4- to 6-year-olds who were exposed to cocaine in utero exhibit higher instances of depression, anxiety, social, thought, and attention problems, and delinquent and aggressive behaviors than their unexposed counterparts). There can be no doubt that a mother's ingesting this drug can cause tragic injury to a fetus and a child. There should be no doubt that South Carolina can impose punishment upon an expectant mother who has so little regard for her own unborn that she risks causing him &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*90&lt;/span&gt; or her lifelong damage and suffering. The State, by taking special measures to give rehabilitation and training to expectant mothers with this tragic addiction or weakness, acts well within its powers and its civic obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holding of the Court, furthermore, does not call into question the validity of mandatory reporting laws such as child abuse laws which require teachers to report evidence of child abuse to the proper authorities, even if arrest and prosecution is the likely result. That in turn highlights the real difficulty. As this case comes to us, and as reputable sources confirm, see K. Farkas, Training Health Care and Human Services Personnel in Perinatal Substance Abuse, in Drug &amp;amp; Alcohol Abuse Reviews, Substance Abuse During Pregnancy and Childhood 13, 27-28 (R. Watson ed. 1995); U. S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Pregnant, Substance-Using Women 48 (1993), we must accept the premise that the medical profession can adopt acceptable criteria for testing expectant mothers for cocaine use in order to provide prompt and effective counseling to the mother and to take proper medical steps to protect the child. If prosecuting authorities then adopt legitimate procedures to discover this information and prosecution follows, that ought not to invalidate the testing. One of the ironies of the case, then, may be that the program now under review, which gives the cocaine user a second and third chance, might be replaced by some more rigorous system. We must, however, take the case as it comes to us; and the use of handcuffs, arrests, prosecutions, and police assistance in designing and implementing the testing and rehabilitation policy cannot be sustained under our previous cases concerning mandatory testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An essential, distinguishing feature of the special needs cases is that the person searched has consented, though the usual voluntariness analysis is altered because adverse consequences &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*91&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; dismissal from employment or disqualification from playing on a high school sports team) will follow from refusal. The person searched has given consent, as defined to take into account that the consent was not voluntary in the full sense of the word. See &lt;i&gt;Skinner,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S., at 615; &lt;i&gt;Von Raab,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S., at 660-661; &lt;i&gt;Acton,&lt;/i&gt; 515 U. S., at 650-651. The consent, and the circumstances in which it was given, bear upon the reasonableness of the whole special needs program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, on the other hand, the question of consent, even with the special connotation used in the special needs cases, has yet to be decided. Indeed, the Court finds it necessary to take the unreal step of assuming there was no voluntary consent at all. Thus, we have erected a strange world for deciding the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My discussion has endeavored to address the permissibility of a law enforcement purpose in this artificial context. The role played by consent might have affected our assessment of the issues. My concurrence in the judgment, furthermore, should not be interpreted as having considered or resolved the important questions raised by Justice Scalia with reference to whether limits might be imposed on the use of the evidence if in fact it were obtained with the patient's consent and in the context of the special needs program. Had we the prerogative to discuss the role played by consent, the case might have been quite a different one. All are in agreement, of course, that the Court of Appeals will address these issues in further proceedings on remand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;With these remarks, I concur in the judgment. Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Thomas join as to Part II, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is always an unappealing aspect to the use of doctors and nurses, ministers of mercy, to obtain incriminating evidence against the supposed objects of their ministration&#151; although here, it is correctly pointed out, the doctors and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*92&lt;/span&gt; nurses were ministering not just to the mothers but also to the children whom their cooperation with the police was meant to protect. But whatever may be the correct social judgment concerning the desirability of what occurred here, that is not the issue in the present case. The Constitution does not resolve all difficult social questions, but leaves the vast majority of them to resolution by debate and the democratic process&#151;which would produce a decision by the citizens of Charleston, through their elected representatives, to forbid or permit the police action at issue here. The question before us is a narrower one: whether, whatever the desirability of this police conduct, it violates the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures. In my view, it plainly does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in Fourth Amendment analysis is to identify the search or seizure at issue. What petitioners, the Court, and to a lesser extent the concurrence really object to is not the urine testing, but the hospital's reporting of positive drug-test results to police. But the latter is obviously not a search. At most it may be a "derivative use of the product of a past unlawful search," which, of course, "work[s] no new Fourth Amendment wrong" and "presents a question, not of rights, but of remedies." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Calandra,&lt;/i&gt; 414 U. S. 338, 354 (1974). There is only one act that could conceivably be regarded as a search of petitioners in the present case: the &lt;i&gt;taking&lt;/i&gt; of the urine sample. I suppose the &lt;i&gt;testing&lt;/i&gt;  of that urine for traces of unlawful drugs could be considered a search of sorts, but the Fourth Amendment protects only against searches of citizens' "persons, houses, papers, and effects"; and it is entirely unrealistic to regard urine as one of the "effects" (&lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; part of the property) of the person who has passed and abandoned it. Cf. &lt;i&gt;California&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Greenwood,&lt;/i&gt;  486 U. S. 35 (1988) (garbage left at curb is not property protected by the Fourth Amendment). Some would argue, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*93&lt;/span&gt; I suppose, that testing of the urine is prohibited by some generalized privacy right "emanating" from the "penumbras" of the Constitution (a question that is not before us); but it is not even arguable that the testing of urine that has been lawfully obtained is a Fourth Amendment search. (I may add that, even if it were, the factors legitimizing the taking of the sample, which I discuss below, would likewise legitimize the testing of it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is rudimentary Fourth Amendment law that a search which has been consented to is not unreasonable. There is no contention in the present case that the urine samples were extracted forcibly. The only conceivable bases for saying that they were obtained without consent are the contentions (1) that the consent was coerced by the patients' need for medical treatment, (2) that the consent was uninformed because the patients were not told that the tests would include testing for drugs, and (3) that the consent was uninformed because the patients were not told that the results of the tests would be provided to the police.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; (When the court below said that it was reserving the factual issue of consent, see 186 F. 3d 469, 476 (CA4 1999), it was referring at most to these three&#151;and perhaps just to the last two.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*94&lt;/span&gt; Under our established Fourth Amendment law, the last two contentions would not suffice, even without reference to the special-needs doctrine. The Court's analogizing of this case to &lt;i&gt;Miranda&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arizona,&lt;/i&gt; 384 U. S. 436 (1966), and its claim that "standards of knowing waiver" apply, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 85, are flatly contradicted by our jurisprudence, which shows that using lawfully (but deceivingly) obtained material for purposes other than those represented, and giving that material or information derived from it to the police, is not unconstitutional. In &lt;i&gt;Hoffa&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 385 U. S. 293 (1966), "[t]he argument [was] that [the informant's] failure to disclose his role as a government informant vitiated the consent that the petitioner gave" for the agent's access to evidence of criminal wrongdoing, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 300. We rejected that argument, because "the Fourth Amendment [does not protect] a wrongdoer's misplaced belief that a person to whom he voluntarily confides his wrongdoing will not reveal it." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 302. Because the defendant had voluntarily provided access to the evidence, there was no reasonable expectation of privacy to invade. Abuse of trust is surely a sneaky and ungentlemanly thing, and perhaps there should be (as there are) laws against such conduct by the government. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 50 U. S. C. &#167; 403-7 (1994 ed., Supp. IV) (prohibiting the "Intelligence Community[`s]" use of journalists as agents). That, however, is immaterial for Fourth Amendment purposes, for "&lt;i&gt;however strongly&lt;/i&gt; a defendant may trust an apparent colleague, his expectations in this respect are not protected by the Fourth Amendment when it turns out that the colleague is a government agent regularly communicating with the authorities." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;White,&lt;/i&gt; 401 U. S. 745, 749 (1971) (emphasis added). The &lt;i&gt;Hoffa&lt;/i&gt; line of cases, I may note, does not distinguish between operations meant to catch a criminal in the act, and those meant only to gather evidence of prior wrongdoing. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Miller,&lt;/i&gt; 425 U. S. 435, 440-443 (1976); cf. &lt;i&gt;Illinois&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Perkins,&lt;/i&gt;  496 U. S. 292, 298 (1990) (relying on &lt;i&gt;Hoffa&lt;/i&gt; in holding the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*95&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Miranda&lt;/i&gt; rule did not require suppression of an inmate confession given an agent posing as a fellow prisoner).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until today, we have &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; held&#151;or even suggested&#151;that material which a person voluntarily entrusts to someone else cannot be given by that person to the police, and used for whatever evidence it may contain.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Without so much as discussing the point, the Court today opens a hole in our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, the size and shape of which is entirely indeterminate. Today's holding would be remarkable enough if the confidential relationship violated by the police conduct were at least one protected by state law. It would be surprising to learn, for example, that in a State which recognizes a spousal evidentiary privilege the police cannot use evidence obtained from a cooperating husband or wife. But today's holding goes even beyond that, since there does not exist any physician-patient privilege in South Carolina. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Peagler&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Atlantic Coast R. R. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 232 S. C. 274, 101 S. E. 2d 821 (1958). Since the Court declines even to discuss the issue, it leaves law enforcement officials entirely in the dark as to when they can use incriminating evidence obtained from "trusted" sources.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Presumably the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*96&lt;/span&gt; lines will be drawn in the case-by-case development of a whole new branch of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, taking yet another social judgment (which confidential relationships ought not be invaded by the police) out of democratic control, and confiding it to the uncontrolled judgment of this Court&#151;uncontrolled because there is no common-law precedent to guide it. I would adhere to our established law, which says that information obtained through violation of a relationship of trust is obtained consensually, and is hence not a search.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*97&lt;/span&gt; There remains to be considered the first possible basis for invalidating this search, which is that the patients were coerced to produce their urine samples by their necessitous circumstances, to wit, their need for medical treatment of their pregnancy. If that was coercion, it was not coercion applied by the government&#151;and if such nongovernmental coercion sufficed, the police would never be permitted to use the ballistic evidence obtained from treatment of a patient with a bullet wound. And the Fourth Amendment would invalidate those many state laws that require physicians to report gunshot wounds,&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; evidence of spousal abuse,&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; and (like the South Carolina law relevant here, see S. C. Code Ann. &#167; 20-7-510 (2000)) evidence of child abuse.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*98&lt;/span&gt; II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it clear, therefore, that there is no basis for saying that obtaining of the urine sample was unconstitutional. The special-needs doctrine is thus quite irrelevant, since it operates only to validate searches and seizures that are otherwise unlawful. In the ensuing discussion, however, I shall assume (contrary to legal precedent) that the taking of the urine sample was (either because of the patients' necessitous circumstances, or because of failure to disclose that the urine would be tested for drugs, or because of failure to disclose that the results of the test would be given to the police) coerced. Indeed, I shall even assume (contrary to common sense) that the testing of the urine constituted an unconsented search of the patients' effects. On those assumptions, the special-needs doctrine &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; become relevant; and, properly applied, would validate what was done here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion of the Court that the special-needs doctrine is inapplicable rests upon its contention that respondents "undert[ook] to obtain [drug] evidence from their patients" not for any medical purpose, but "&lt;i&gt;for the specific purpose of incriminating those patients.&lt;/i&gt; " &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 85 (emphasis in original). In other words, the purported medical rationale was merely a pretext; there was no special need. See &lt;i&gt;Skinner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Railway Labor Executives' Assn.,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 602, 621, n. 5 (1989). This contention contradicts the District Court's finding of fact that the goal of the testing policy "was not to arrest patients but to facilitate their treatment and protect both the mother and unborn child." App. to Pet. for Cert. A-38.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; This finding is binding upon us unless clearly erroneous, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*99&lt;/span&gt; see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a). Not only do I find it supportable; I think any other finding would have to be overturned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cocaine tests started in April 1989, &lt;i&gt;neither at police suggestion nor with police involvement.&lt;/i&gt; Expectant mothers who tested positive were referred by hospital staff for substance-abuse treatment, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 70 (opinion of the Court)&#151;an obvious health benefit to both mother and child. See App. 43 (testimony that a single use of cocaine can cause fetal damage). And, since "[i]nfants whose mothers abuse cocaine during pregnancy are born with a wide variety of physical and neurological abnormalities," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 89 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment), which require medical attention, see Brief in Opposition A76-A77, the tests were of additional medical benefit in predicting needed postnatal treatment for the child. Thus, in their origin&#151;before the police were in any way involved&#151;the tests had an immediate, not merely an "ultimate," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 82 (opinion of the Court), purpose of improving maternal and infant health. Several months after the testing had been initiated, a nurse discovered that local police were arresting pregnant users of cocaine for child abuse, the hospital's general counsel wrote the county solicitor to ask "what, if anything, our Medical Center needs to do to assist you in this matter," App. 499 (South Carolina law requires child abuse to be reported, see S. C. Code Ann. &#167; 20-7-510), the police suggested ways to avoid tainting evidence, and the hospital and police in conjunction used the testing program as a means of securing what the Court calls the "ultimate" health benefit of coercing drug-abusing mothers into drug treatment. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 70-73, 82. Why would there be any reason to believe that, once &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*100&lt;/span&gt; this policy of using the drug tests for their "ultimate" health benefits had been adopted, use of them for their original, &lt;i&gt;immediate,&lt;/i&gt; benefits somehow disappeared, and testing somehow became in its entirety nothing more than a "pretext" for obtaining grounds for arrest? On the face of it, this is incredible. The only evidence of the exclusively arrestrelated purpose of the testing adduced by the Court is that the police-cooperation policy &lt;i&gt;itself&lt;/i&gt; does not describe how to care for cocaine-exposed infants. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 73, 82. But &lt;i&gt;of course&lt;/i&gt; it does not, since that policy, adopted months after the cocaine testing was initiated, had as its only health object the "ultimate" goal of inducing drug treatment through threat of arrest. Does the Court really believe (or even &lt;i&gt;hope&lt;/i&gt; ) that, once invalidation of the program challenged here has been decreed, drug testing will cease?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, there can be no basis for the Court's purported ability to "distinguis[h] this case from circumstances in which physicians or psychologists, in the course of ordinary medical procedures aimed at helping the patient herself, come across information that . . . is subject to reporting requirements," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 80-81, unless it is this: That the &lt;i&gt;addition&lt;/i&gt; of a lawenforcement-related purpose &lt;i&gt;to&lt;/i&gt; a legitimate medical purpose destroys applicability of the "special-needs" doctrine. But that is quite impossible, since the special-needs doctrine was developed, and is ordinarily employed, precisely to enable searches &lt;i&gt;by law enforcement officials&lt;/i&gt; who, of course, ordinarily have a law enforcement objective. Thus, in &lt;i&gt;Griffin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin,&lt;/i&gt; 483 U. S. 868 (1987), a probation officer received a tip from a detective that petitioner, a felon on probation, possessed a firearm. Accompanied by police, he conducted a warrantless search of petitioner's home. The weapon was found and used as evidence in the probationer's trial for unlawful possession of a firearm. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 870-872. Affirming denial of a motion to suppress, we concluded that the "special need" of assuring compliance with terms of release &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*101&lt;/span&gt; justified a warrantless search of petitioner's home. Notably, we observed that a probation officer is not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"the police officer who normally conducts searches against the ordinary citizen. He is an employee of the State Department of Health and Social Services who, while assuredly charged with protecting the public interest, is also supposed to have in mind the welfare of the probationer . . . . In such a setting, we think it reasonable to dispense with the warrant requirement." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 876-877.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the probation officer, the doctors here do not "ordinarily conduc[t] searches against the ordinary citizen," and they are "supposed to have in mind the welfare of the [mother and child]." That they have in mind in addition the provision of evidence to the police should make no difference. The Court suggests that if police involvement in this case was in some way incidental and after-the-fact, that would make a difference in the outcome. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 80-84. But in &lt;i&gt;Griffin,&lt;/i&gt;  even more than here, police were involved in the search from the very beginning; indeed, the initial tip about the gun came from a detective. Under the factors relied upon by the Court, the use of evidence approved in &lt;i&gt;Griffin&lt;/i&gt; would have been permitted only if the parole officer had been untrained in chain-of-custody procedures, had not known of the possibility a gun was present, and had been unaccompanied by police when he simply happened upon the weapon. Why any or all of these is constitutionally significant is baffling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners seek to distinguish &lt;i&gt;Griffin&lt;/i&gt; by observing that probationers enjoy a lesser expectation of privacy than does the general public. That is irrelevant to the point I make here, which is that the presence of a law enforcement purpose does not render the special-needs doctrine inapplicable. In any event, I doubt whether Griffin's reasonable expectation of privacy in his home was any less than petitioners' reasonable expectation of privacy in their urine taken, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*102&lt;/span&gt; or in the urine tests performed, in a hospital&#151;especially in a State such as South Carolina, which recognizes no physician-patient testimonial privilege and requires the physician's duty of confidentiality to yield to public policy, see &lt;i&gt;McCormick&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;England,&lt;/i&gt; 328 S. C. 627, 633, 640-642, 494 S. E. 2d 431, 434, 438-439 (App. 1997); and which requires medical conditions that indicate a violation of the law to be reported to authorities, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; S. C. Code Ann. &#167; 20-7-510 (2000) (child abuse). Cf. &lt;i&gt;Whalen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Roe,&lt;/i&gt; 429 U. S. 589, 597-598 (1977) (privacy interest does not forbid government to require hospitals to provide, for law enforcement purposes, names of patients receiving prescriptions of frequently abused drugs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concurrence makes essentially the same basic error as the Court, though it puts the point somewhat differently: "The special needs cases we have decided," it says, "do not sustain the active use of law enforcement . . . as an integral part of a program which seeks to achieve legitimate, civil objectives." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 88. &lt;i&gt;Griffin&lt;/i&gt; shows that is not true. Indeed, &lt;i&gt;Griffin&lt;/i&gt; shows that there is not even any truth in the more limited proposition that our cases do not support application of the special-needs exception where the "legitimate, civil objectives" are sought only &lt;i&gt;through&lt;/i&gt; the use of law enforcement means. (Surely the parole officer in &lt;i&gt;Griffin&lt;/i&gt;  was using threat of reincarceration to assure compliance with parole.) But even if this latter proposition &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; true, it would invalidate what occurred here only if the drug testing sought exclusively the "ultimate" health benefits achieved by coercing the mothers into drug treatment through threat of prosecution. But in fact the drug testing sought, independently of law enforcement involvement, the "immediate" health benefits of identifying drug-impaired mother and child for necessary medical treatment. The concurrence concedes that if the testing is conducted for medical reasons, the fact that "prosecuting authorities &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; adopt legitimate procedures to discover this information and prosecution follows &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*103&lt;/span&gt;. . . ought not to invalidate the testing." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 90 (emphasis added). But here the police involvement in each case did &lt;i&gt;take place after&lt;/i&gt; the testing was conducted for independent reasons. Surely the concurrence cannot mean that no police-suggested procedures (such as preserving the chain of custody of the urine sample) can be applied until &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the testing; or that the police-suggested procedures must have been &lt;i&gt;designed&lt;/i&gt; after the testing. The facts in &lt;i&gt;Griffin&lt;/i&gt; (and common sense) show that this cannot be so. It seems to me that the only real distinction between what the concurrence must reasonably be thought to be approving, and what we have here, is that here the police took the lesser step of initially &lt;i&gt;threatening&lt;/i&gt; prosecution rather than bringing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I indicated at the outset, it is not the function of this Court&#151;at least not in Fourth Amendment cases&#151;to weigh petitioners' privacy interest against the State's interest in meeting the crisis of "crack babies" that developed in the late 1980's. I cannot refrain from observing, however, that the outcome of a wise weighing of those interests is by no means clear. The initial goal of the doctors and nurses who conducted cocaine testing in this case was to refer pregnant drug addicts to treatment centers, and to prepare for necessary treatment of their possibly affected children. When the doctors and nurses agreed to the program providing test results to the police, they did so because (in addition to the fact that child abuse was required by law to be reported) they wanted to use the sanction of arrest as a strong incentive for their addicted patients to undertake drug-addiction treatment. And the police themselves used it for that benign purpose, as is shown by the fact that only 30 of 253 women testing positive for cocaine were ever arrested, and only 2 of those prosecuted. See App. 1125-1126. It would not be unreasonable to conclude that today's judgment, authorizing the assessment of damages against the county &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*104&lt;/span&gt; solicitor and individual doctors and nurses who participated in the program, proves once again that no good deed goes unpunished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as far as the Fourth Amendment is concerned: There was no unconsented search in this case. And if there was, it would have been validated by the special-needs doctrine. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1]  As several witnesses testified at trial, the problem of "crack babies" was widely perceived in the late 1980's as a national epidemic, prompting considerable concern both in the medical community and among the general populace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Under South Carolina law, a viable fetus has historically been regarded as a person; in 1995, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that the ingestion of cocaine during the third trimester of pregnancy constitutes criminal child neglect. &lt;i&gt;Whitner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;South Carolina,&lt;/i&gt; 328 S. C. 1, 492 S. E. 2d 777 (1995), cert. denied, 523 U. S. 1145 (1998).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  In his letter dated August 23, 1989, Good wrote: "Please advise us if your office is anticipating future criminal action and what if anything our Medical Center needs to do to assist you in this matter." App. to Pet. for Cert. A-67.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Those criteria were as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"1. No prenatal care&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"2. Late prenatal care after 24 weeks gestation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"3. Incomplete prenatal care&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"4. Abruptio placentae&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"5. Intrauterine fetal death&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"6. Preterm labor `of no obvious cause'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"7. IUGR [intrauterine growth retardation] `of no obvious cause'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"8. Previously known drug or alcohol abuse&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"9. Unexplained congenital anomalies." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at A-53 to A-54.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  Despite the conditional description of the first category, when the policy was in its initial stages, a positive test was immediately reported to the police, who then promptly arrested the patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  The instructions read: "THERE WERE NO SEARCH WARRANTS ISSUED BY A MAGISTRATE OR ANY OTHER PROPER JUDICIAL OFFICER TO PERMIT THESE URINE SCREENS TO BE TAKEN. THERE NOT BEING A WARRANT ISSUED, THEY ARE UNREASONABLE AND IN VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES, UNLESS THE DEFENDANTS HAVE SHOWN BY THE GREATER WEIGHT OR PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE THAT THE PLAINTIFFS CONSENTED TO THOSE SEARCHES." App. 1314-1315. Under the judge's instructions, in order to find that the plaintiffs had consented to the searches, it was necessary for the jury to find that they had consented to the taking of the samples, to the testing for evidence of cocaine, and to the possible disclosure of the test results to the police. Respondents have not argued, as Justice Scalia does, that it is permissible for members of the staff of a public hospital to use diagnostic tests "deceivingly" to obtain incriminating evidence from their patients. See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 94 (dissenting opinion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  The term "special needs" first appeared in Justice Blackmun's opinion concurring in the judgment in &lt;i&gt;New Jersey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;T. L. O.,&lt;/i&gt; 469 U. S. 325, 351 (1985). In his concurrence, Justice Blackmun agreed with the Court that there are limited exceptions to the probable-cause requirement, in which reasonableness is determined by "a careful balancing of governmental and private interests," but concluded that such a test should only be applied "in those exceptional circumstances in which special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and probablecause requirement impracticable . . . ." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; This Court subsequently adopted the "special needs" terminology in &lt;i&gt;O'Connor&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ortega,&lt;/i&gt; 480 U. S. 709, 720 (1987) (plurality opinion), and &lt;i&gt;Griffin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin,&lt;/i&gt; 483 U. S. 868, 873 (1987), concluding that, in limited circumstances, a search unsupported by either warrant or probable cause can be constitutional when "special needs" other than the normal need for law enforcement provide sufficient justification. See also &lt;i&gt;Vernonia School Dist. 47J&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Acton,&lt;/i&gt; 515 U. S. 646, 652-653 (1995).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  The majority stated that the District Court had made such a finding. 186 F. 3d, at 477. The text of the relevant finding, made in the context of petitioners' now abandoned Title VI claim, reads as follows: "The policy was applied in all maternity departments at MUSC. Its goal was not to arrest patients but to facilitate their treatment and protect both the mother and unborn child." App. to Pet. for Cert. A-38. That finding, however, must be read in light of this comment by the District Court with respect to the Fourth Amendment claim:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;". . . THESE SEARCHES WERE NOT DONE BY THE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY FOR INDEPENDENT PURPOSES. IF THEY HAD BEEN, THEN THEY WOULD NOT IMPLICATE THE FOURTH AMENDMENT. OBVIOUSLY AS I POINT OUT THERE ON PAGE 4, NORMALLY URINE SCREENS AND BLOOD TESTS AND THAT TYPE OF THING CAN BE TAKEN BY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT THE FOURTH AMENDMENT. THE ONLY REASON THE FOURTH AMENDMENT IS IMPLICATED HERE IS THAT THE POLICE CAME IN AND THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT REACHED THAT THE POSITIVE SCREENS WOULD BE SHARED WITH THE POLICE. AND THEN THE SCREEN IS NOT DONE INDEPENDENT OF POLICE, IT'S DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE POLICE AND THAT IMPLICATES THE FOURTH AMENDMENT." App. 1248-1249.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9]  In arguing that the urine tests at issue were not searches, the dissent attempts to disaggregate the taking and testing of the urine sample from the reporting of the results to the police. See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 92. However, in our special needs cases, we have routinely treated urine screens taken by state agents as searches within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment even though the results were not reported to the police, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chandler&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Miller,&lt;/i&gt; 520 U. S. 305 (1997); &lt;i&gt;Vernonia School Dist. 47J&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Acton,&lt;/i&gt;  515 U. S. 646 (1995); &lt;i&gt;Skinner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Railway Labor Executives' Assn.,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 602, 617 (1989); &lt;i&gt;Treasury Employees&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Von Raab,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 656 (1989), and respondents here do not contend that the tests were not searches. Rather, they argue that the searches were justified by consent and/or by special needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[10]  In a footnote to their brief, respondents do argue that the searches were not entirely suspicionless. Brief for Respondents 23, n. 13. They do not, however, point to any evidence in the record indicating that any of the nine search criteria was more apt to be caused by cocaine use than by some other factor, such as malnutrition, illness, or indigency. More significantly, their legal argument and the reasoning of the majority panel opinion rest on the premise that the policy would be valid even if the tests were conducted randomly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[11]  The dissent would have us do otherwise and resolve the issue of consent in favor of respondents. Because the Court of Appeals did not discuss this issue, we think it more prudent to allow that court to resolve the legal and factual issues in the first instance, and we express no view on those issues. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Glover&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 531 U. S. 198 (2001); &lt;i&gt;National Collegiate Athletic Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Smith,&lt;/i&gt; 525 U. S. 459, 470 (1999).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[12]  &lt;i&gt;Chandler,&lt;/i&gt; 520 U. S., at 312, 318; &lt;i&gt;Acton,&lt;/i&gt; 515 U. S., at 658; &lt;i&gt;Skinner,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S., at 621, n. 5, 622, n. 6; &lt;i&gt;Von Raab,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S., at 663, 666-667, 672, n. 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[13]  There are some circumstances in which state hospital employees, like other citizens, may have a duty to provide law enforcement officials with evidence of criminal conduct acquired in the course of routine treatment, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; S. C. Code Ann. &#167; 20-7-510 (2000) (physicians and nurses required to report to child welfare agency or law enforcement authority "when in the person's professional capacity the person" receives information that a child has been abused or neglected). While the existence of such laws might lead a patient to expect that members of the hospital staff might turn over evidence acquired in the course of treatment to which the patient had consented, they surely would not lead a patient to anticipate that hospital staff would intentionally set out to obtain incriminating evidence from their patients for law enforcement purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[14]  In fact, we have previously recognized that an intrusion on that expectation may have adverse consequences because it may deter patients from receiving needed medical care. &lt;i&gt;Whalen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Roe,&lt;/i&gt; 429 U. S. 589, 599-600 (1977). Cf&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; Poland, Dombrowski, Ager, &amp;amp; Sokol, Punishing pregnant drug users: enhancing the flight from care, 31 Drug and Alcohol Dependence 199-203 (1993).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[15]  As The Chief Justice recently noted: "The `special needs' doctrine, which has been used to uphold certain suspicionless searches performed for reasons unrelated to law enforcement, is an exception to the general rule that a search must be based on individualized suspicion of wrongdoing." &lt;i&gt;Indianapolis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Edmond,&lt;/i&gt; 531 U. S. 32, 54 (2000) (dissenting opinion); see also nn. 16-17, &lt;i&gt;infra.&lt;/i&gt; In &lt;i&gt;T. L. O.,&lt;/i&gt; we made a point of distinguishing searches "carried out by school authorities acting alone and on their own authority" from those conducted "in conjunction with or at the behest of law enforcement agencies." 469 U. S., at 341, n. 7.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dissent, however, relying on &lt;i&gt;Griffin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin,&lt;/i&gt; 483 U. S. 868 (1987), argues that the special needs doctrine "is ordinarily employe[d], precisely to enable searches &lt;i&gt;by law enforcement officials&lt;/i&gt; who, of course, ordinarily have a law enforcement objective." &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 100. Viewed in the context of our special needs case law and even viewed in isolation, &lt;i&gt;Griffin&lt;/i&gt; does not support the proposition for which the dissent invokes it. In other special needs cases, we have tolerated suspension of the Fourth Amendment's warrant or probable-cause requirement in part because there was no law enforcement purpose behind the searches in those cases, and there was little, if any, entanglement with law enforcement. See &lt;i&gt;Skinner,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S., at 620-621; &lt;i&gt;Von Raab,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S., at 665-666; &lt;i&gt;Acton,&lt;/i&gt;  515 U. S., at 658. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; our decision in &lt;i&gt;Griffin,&lt;/i&gt; we reserved the question whether "routine use in criminal prosecutions of evidence obtained pursuant to the administrative scheme would give rise to an inference of pretext, or otherwise impugn the administrative nature of the . . . program." &lt;i&gt;Skinner,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S., at 621, n. 5. In &lt;i&gt;Griffin&lt;/i&gt; itself, this Court noted that "[a]lthough a probation officer is not an impartial magistrate, neither is he the police officer who normally conducts searches against the ordinary citizen." 483 U. S., at 876. Finally, we agree with petitioners that &lt;i&gt;Griffin&lt;/i&gt; is properly read as limited by the fact that probationers have a lesser expectation of privacy than the public at large. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 874-875.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[16]  In &lt;i&gt;Skinner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Railway Labor Executives' Assn.,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 602 (1989), this Court noted that "[t]he FRA has prescribed toxicological tests, not to assist in the prosecution of employees, but rather `to prevent accidents and casualties in railroad operations that result from impairment of employees by alcohol or drugs.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 620-621 (quoting 49 CFR &#167; 219.1(a) (1987)). Similarly, in &lt;i&gt;Treasury Employees&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Von Raab,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 656 (1989), we concluded that it was "clear that the Customs Service's drugtesting program is not designed to serve the ordinary needs of law enforcement. Test results may not be used in a criminal prosecution of the employee without the employee's consent." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 665-666. In the same vein, in &lt;i&gt;Acton,&lt;/i&gt; 515 U. S., at 658, we relied in part on the fact that "the results of the tests are disclosed only to a limited class of school personnel who have a need to know; and they are not turned over to law enforcement authorities or used for any internal disciplinary function" in finding the searches reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[17]  "Today's opinion speaks of a `closely guarded' class of permissible suspicionless searches which must be justified by a `special need.' But this term, as used in &lt;i&gt;Skinner&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Von Raab&lt;/i&gt; and on which the Court now relies, was used in a quite different sense than it is used by the Court today. In &lt;i&gt;Skinner&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Von Raab&lt;/i&gt; it was used to describe a basis for a search apart from the regular needs of law enforcement, &lt;i&gt;Skinner,&lt;/i&gt; [489 U. S.], at 620; &lt;i&gt;Von Raab,&lt;/i&gt; [489 U. S.], at 669. The `special needs' inquiry as delineated there has not required especially great `importan[ce],' [520 U. S.], at 318, unless one considers `the supervision of probationers,' or the `operation of a government office,' &lt;i&gt;Skinner, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 620, to be especially `important.' Under our precedents, if there was a proper governmental purpose other than law enforcement, there was a `special need,' and the Fourth Amendment then required the familiar balancing between that interest and the individual's privacy interest." &lt;i&gt;Chandler&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Miller,&lt;/i&gt; 520 U. S., at 325 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[18]  Our emphasis on this distinction should make it clear that, contrary to the hyperbole in the dissent, we do not view these reporting requirements as "clearly bad." See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 95-96, n. 3. Those requirements are simply not in issue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[19]  Accordingly, the police organized a meeting with the staff of the police and hospital laboratory staffs, as well as Nurse Brown, in which the police went over the concept of a chain of custody system with the MUSC staff. App. 1052-1053.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[20]  We italicize those words lest our reasoning be misunderstood. See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 86-88 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). In none of our previous special needs cases have we upheld the collection of evidence for criminal law enforcement purposes. Our essential point is the same as Justice Kennedy's&#151;the extensive entanglement of law enforcement cannot be justified by reference to legitimate needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the dissent, the fact that MUSC performed tests prior to the development of Policy M-7 should immunize any subsequent testing policy despite the presence of a law enforcement purpose and extensive law enforcement involvement. See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 98-100. To say that any therapeutic purpose did not disappear is simply to miss the point. What matters is that under the new policy developed by the solicitor's office and MUSC, law enforcement involvement was the means by which that therapeutic purpose was to be met. Policy M-7 was, at its core, predicated on the use of law enforcement. The extensive involvement of law enforcement and the threat of prosecution were, as respondents admitted, essential to the program's success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[21]  Accordingly, this case differs from &lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Burger,&lt;/i&gt; 482 U. S. 691 (1987), in which the Court upheld a scheme in which police officers were used to carry out administrative inspections of vehicle dismantling businesses. That case involved an industry in which the expectation of privacy in commercial premises was "particularly attenuated" given the extent to which the industry in question was closely regulated. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 700. More important for our purposes, the Court relied on the "plain administrative purposes" of the scheme to reject the contention that the statute was in fact "designed to gather evidence to enable convictions under the penal laws . . . ." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 715. The discovery of evidence of other violations would have been merely incidental to the purposes of the administrative search. In contrast, in this case, the policy was specifically designed to gather evidence of violations of penal laws.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case also differs from the handful of seizure cases in which we have applied a balancing test to determine Fourth Amendment reasonableness. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Michigan Dept. of State Police&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sitz,&lt;/i&gt; 496 U. S. 444, 455 (1990); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Martinez-Fuerte,&lt;/i&gt; 428 U. S. 543 (1976). First, those cases involved roadblock seizures, rather than "the intrusive search of the body or the home." See &lt;i&gt;Indianapolis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Edmond,&lt;/i&gt; 531 U. S., at 54-55 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting); &lt;i&gt;Martinez-Fuerte,&lt;/i&gt; 428 U. S., at 561 ("[W]e deal neither with searches nor with the sanctity of private dwellings, ordinarily afforded the most stringent Fourth Amendment protection"). Second, the Court explicitly distinguished the cases dealing with checkpoints from those dealing with "special needs." &lt;i&gt;Sitz,&lt;/i&gt; 496 U. S.,at 450.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[22]  Thus, under respondents' approach, any search to generate evidence for use by the police in enforcing general criminal laws would be justified by reference to the broad social benefits that those laws might bring about (or, put another way, the social harms that they might prevent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[23]  It is especially difficult to argue that the program here was designed simply to save lives. &lt;i&gt;Amici&lt;/i&gt; claim a near consensus in the medical community that programs of the sort at issue, by discouraging women who use drugs from seeking prenatal care, harm, rather than advance, the cause of prenatal health. See Brief for American Medical Association as &lt;i&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 6-22; Brief for American Public Health Association et al. as &lt;i&gt;Amici Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 17-21; Brief for NARAL Foundation et al. as &lt;i&gt;Amici Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 18-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[24]  In fact, some MUSC staff made this distinction themselves. See Pl. Exh. No. 14, Hulsey, 11-17-89, Coke Committee, 1-2 ("The use of medically indicated tests for substance abuse, obtained in conventional manners, must be distinguished from mandatory screening and collection of evidence using such methods as chain of custody, etc. . . . The question is raised as to whether pediatricians should function as law enforcement officials. While the reporting of criminal activity to appropriate authorities may be required and/or ethically just, the active pursuit of evidence to be used against individuals presenting for medical care may not be proper").
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dissent, however, mischaracterizes our opinion as holding that "material which a person voluntarily entrusts to someone else cannot be given by that person to the police, and used for whatever evidence it may contain." &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 95. But, as we have noted elsewhere, given the posture of the case, we must assume for purposes of decision that the patients did &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; consent to the searches, and we leave the question of consent for the Court of Appeals to determine. See n. 11&lt;i&gt;, supra.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dissent further argues that our holding "leaves law enforcement officials entirely in the dark as to when they can use incriminating evidence obtained from `trusted' sources." See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 95. With all due respect, we disagree. We do not address a case in which doctors independently complied with reporting requirements. Rather, as we point out above, in this case, medical personnel used the criteria set out in n. 4, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; to collect evidence for law enforcement purposes, and law enforcement officers were extensively involved in the initiation, design, and implementation of the program. In such circumstances, the Fourth Amendment's general prohibition against nonconsensual, warrantless, and suspicionless searches applies in the absence of consent. We decline to accept the dissent's invitation to make a foray into dicta and address other situations not before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The Court asserts that it is improper to "disaggregate the taking and testing of the urine sample from the reporting of the results to the police," because "in our special needs cases, we have routinely treated urine screens taken by state agents as searches within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 76, n. 9. But in all of those cases, the urine was obtained involuntarily. See &lt;i&gt;Chandler&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Miller,&lt;/i&gt; 520 U. S.305 (1997); &lt;i&gt;Vernonia School Dist. 47J&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Acton,&lt;/i&gt; 515 U. S. 646 (1995); &lt;i&gt;Skinner&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Railway Labor Executives' Assn.,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 602 (1989); &lt;i&gt;Treasury Employees&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Von Raab,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 656 (1989). Where the taking of the urine sample is unconsented (and thus a Fourth Amendment search), the subsequent testing and reporting of the results to the police are obviously part of (or infected by) the same search; but where, as here, the taking of the sample was not a Fourth Amendment search, it is necessary to consider separately whether the testing and reporting were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  &lt;i&gt;Hoffa&lt;/i&gt; did say that the Fourth Amendment can be violated by "guileful as well as by forcible intrusions into a constitutionally protected area." 385 U. S.,at 301. The case it cited for that proposition, however, shows what it meant: &lt;i&gt;Gouled&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 255 U. S. 298 (1921),found a Fourth Amendment violation where a Government agent who had obtained access to the defendant's office on pretext of a social visit carried away private papers. "Guile" (rather than force) had been used to &lt;i&gt;go beyond the scope of the consented access to evidence.&lt;/i&gt; Whereas the search in &lt;i&gt;Gouled&lt;/i&gt; was invalidated, the search was approved in &lt;i&gt;Lewis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 385 U. S. 206 (1966), where an equally guileful agent stayed within the bounds of the access to defendant's home, carrying away only a package of drugs that had been voluntarily provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  The Court contends that its opinion does not leave law enforcement officials in the dark as to when they can use incriminating evidence from trusted sources, since it "do[es] not address a case in which doctors independently complied with reporting requirements," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 85, n.24&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; I find it hard to understand how not addressing that point fails to leave it enshrouded in darkness&#151;unless the Court means that such reporting requirements are clearly bad. (If voluntary betrayal of a trust in mere &lt;i&gt;cooperation&lt;/i&gt; with the police constitutes a Fourth Amendment search, surely betrayal of a trust &lt;i&gt;at the direction&lt;/i&gt; of the legislature must be.) But in any event, reporting requirements are an infinitesimal part of the problem. What about a doctor's&#151;or a spouse's&#151;voluntary provision of information to the police, without the compulsion of a statute?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  The Court contends that I am "mischaracteriz[ing]" its opinion, since the Court is merely "assum[ing] for purposes of decision that the patients did &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; consent to the searches, and [leaves] the question of consent for the Court of Appeals to determine." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; That is not responsive. The "question of consent" that the Court leaves open is whether the patients consented, not merely to the taking of the urine samples, but to the drug testing in particular, and to the provision of the results to the police. Consent to the taking of the samples alone&#151;or even to the taking of the samples &lt;i&gt;plus&lt;/i&gt; the drug testing&#151;does not suffice. The Court's contention that the question of the sufficiency of that more limited consent is not before us because respondents did not raise it, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 74, n. 6, is simply mistaken. Part II of respondents' brief, entitled "The Petitioners consented to the searches," argues that "Petitioners . . . freely and voluntarily . . . provided the urine samples"; that "each of the Petitioners signed a consent to treatment form which authorized the MUSC medical staff to conduct all necessary tests of those urine samples&#151;including drug tests"; and that "[t]here is no precedent in this Court's Fourth Amendment search and seizure jurisprudence which imposes any . . . requirement that the searching agency inform the consenting party that the results of the search will be turned over to law enforcement." Brief for Respondents 38-39. The brief specifically &lt;i&gt;takes issue&lt;/i&gt; with the District Court's charge to the jury&#151;which the Court chooses to accept as an unexaminable "given," see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 74, n. 6&#151;that "the Respondents were required to show that the Petitioners consented to MUSC disclosing the information to law enforcement." Brief for Respondents 39.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, I think it clear that the Court's disposition requires the holding that violation of a relationship of trust constitutes a search. The opinion itself implies that in its description of the issue left for the Court of Appeals on remand, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 77, n. 11: whether "the tests were performed without the &lt;i&gt;informed&lt;/i&gt; consent of the patients," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 77 (emphasis added)&#151;informed, that is, that the urine would be tested for drugs and that the results would be given to the police&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; I am happy, of course, to accept the Court's illogical assurance that it intends no such holding, and urge the Court of Appeals on remand to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Cal. Penal Code Ann. &#167; 11160 (West Supp. 2001); N. Y. Penal Law &#167; 265.25 (McKinney 2000); S. C. Code Ann. &#167; 16-3-1072 (Supp. 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Cal. Penal Code Ann. &#167; 11160 (West Supp. 2001); Colo. Rev. Stat. &#167; 12-36-135 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  The Court contends that I "would have us . . . resolve the issue of consent in favor of respondents," whereas the Court's opinion "more prudent[ly] allow[s] [the Court of Appeals] to resolve the legal and factual issues in the first instance, and . . . express[es] no view on those issues." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 77, n. 11. That is not entirely so. The Court does not resolve the factual issue whether there was consent to the drug testing and to providing the results to the police; and neither do I. But the Court &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt;  resolve the legal issue whether &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; consent was necessary, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 77, 84-85, and n. 24; and so do I. Since the Court concludes it was necessary, the factual inquiry is left for the Fourth Circuit on remand. Since I conclude it was not necessary (and since no one contends that the taking of the urine sample was unconsented), there is on my analysis no factual consent issue remaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  The Court believes that this finding "must be read in light of" the District Court's comment that "`these searches were not done by the medical university for independent purposes. . . . [T]he police came in and there was an agreement reached that the positive screens would be shared with the police. And then the screen is not done independent of police, it'sdone in conjunction with the police and that implicates the Fourth Amendment.' " &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 75, n. 8, quoting App. 1247-1249. But all this shows is that the explicit finding of medical purpose was not a finding of &lt;i&gt;exclusive&lt;/i&gt; medical purpose. As discussed later in text, the special-needs doctrine contains no such exclusivity requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*107&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*107&lt;/span&gt; Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Scalia, and Thomas, JJ., joined. Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg and Breyer, JJ., joined, and in which Souter, J., joined as to Parts II and III, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 124. Souter, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 133.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;David E. Nagle&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;W. Stephen Cannon, Pamela G. Parsons, Walter E. Dellinger, Samuel Estreicher,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rex Darrell Berry.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*108&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Michael Rubin&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Scott A. Kronland, Cliff Palefsky,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Steven L. Robinson.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*109&lt;/span&gt; Justice Kennedy, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 1 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act) excludes from the Act's coverage "contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce." 9 U. S. C. &#167; 1. All but one of the Courts of Appeals which have addressed the issue interpret this provision as exempting contracts of employment of transportation workers, but not other employment contracts, from the FAA's coverage. A different interpretation has been adopted by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which construes the exemption so that all contracts of employment are beyond the FAA's reach, whether or not the worker is engaged in transportation. It applied that rule to the instant case. We now decide that the better interpretation is to construe the statute, as most of the Courts of Appeals have done, to confine the exemption to transportation workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 1995, respondent Saint Clair Adams applied for a job at petitioner Circuit City Stores, Inc., a national retailer of consumer electronics. Adams signed an employment application which included the following provision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I agree that I will settle any and all previously unasserted claims, disputes or controversies arising out of or &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*110&lt;/span&gt; relating to my application or candidacy for employment, employment and/or cessation of employment with Circuit City, &lt;i&gt;exclusively&lt;/i&gt; by final and binding &lt;i&gt;arbitration&lt;/i&gt;  before a neutral Arbitrator. By way of example only, such claims include claims under federal, state, and local statutory or common law, such as the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, including the amendments of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the law of contract and [the] law of tort." App. 13 (emphasis in original).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adams was hired as a sales counselor in Circuit City's store in Santa Rosa, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years later, Adams filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against Circuit City in state court, asserting claims under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act, Cal. Govt. Code Ann. &#167; 12900 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; (West 1992 and Supp. 1997), and other claims based on general tort theories under California law. Circuit City filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, seeking to enjoin the state-court action and to compel arbitration of respondent's claims pursuant to the FAA, 9 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 1&#151; 16. The District Court entered the requested order. Respondent, the court concluded, was obligated by the arbitration agreement to submit his claims against the employer to binding arbitration. An appeal followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While respondent's appeal was pending in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the court ruled on the key issue in an unrelated case. The court held the FAA does not apply to contracts of employment. See &lt;i&gt;Craft&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Campbell Soup Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 177 F. 3d 1083 (1999). In the instant case, following the rule announced in &lt;i&gt;Craft,&lt;/i&gt; the Court of Appeals held the arbitration agreement between Adams and Circuit City was contained in a "contract of employment," and so was not subject to the FAA. 194 F. 3d 1070 (1999). Circuit City petitioned this Court, noting that the Ninth Circuit's &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*111&lt;/span&gt; conclusion that all employment contracts are excluded from the FAA conflicts with every other Court of Appeals to have addressed the question. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;McWilliams&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Logicon, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 143 F. 3d 573, 575-576 (CA10 1998); &lt;i&gt;O'Neil&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hilton Head Hospital,&lt;/i&gt; 115 F. 3d 272, 274 (CA4 1997); &lt;i&gt;Pryner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tractor Supply Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 109 F. 3d 354, 358 (CA7 1997); &lt;i&gt;Cole&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Burns Int'l Security Servs.,&lt;/i&gt; 105 F. 3d 1465, 1470-1472 (CADC 1997); &lt;i&gt;Rojas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;TK Communications, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 87 F. 3d 745, 747-748 (CA5 1996); &lt;i&gt;Asplundh Tree Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bates,&lt;/i&gt; 71 F. 3d 592, 596-601 (CA6 1995); &lt;i&gt;Erving&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Virginia Squires Basketball Club,&lt;/i&gt; 468 F. 2d 1064, 1069 (CA2 1972); &lt;i&gt;Dickstein&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;DuPont,&lt;/i&gt; 443 F. 2d 783, 785 (CA1 1971); &lt;i&gt;Tenney Engineering, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United Elec. &amp;amp; Machine Workers of Am.,&lt;/i&gt; 207 F. 2d 450 (CA3 1953). We granted certiorari to resolve the issue. 529 U. S. 1129 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress enacted the FAA in 1925. As the Court has explained, the FAA was a response to hostility of American courts to the enforcement of arbitration agreements, a judicial disposition inherited from then-longstanding English practice. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dobson,&lt;/i&gt;  513 U. S. 265, 270-271 (1995); &lt;i&gt;Gilmer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 500 U. S. 20, 24 (1991). To give effect to this purpose, the FAA compels judicial enforcement of a wide range of written arbitration agreements. The FAA's coverage provision, &#167; 2, provides that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[a] written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*112&lt;/span&gt; grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract." 9 U. S. C. &#167; 2.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had occasion in &lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 273-277, to consider the significance of Congress' use of the words "involving commerce" in &#167; 2. The analysis began with a reaffirmation of earlier decisions concluding that the FAA was enacted pursuant to Congress' substantive power to regulate interstate commerce and admiralty, see &lt;i&gt;Prima Paint Corp.&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Flood &amp;amp; Conklin Mfg. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 388 U. S. 395, 405 (1967), and that the Act was applicable in state courts and pre-emptive of state laws hostile to arbitration, see &lt;i&gt;Southland Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Keating,&lt;/i&gt; 465 U. S. 1 (1984). Relying upon these background principles and upon the evident reach of the words "involving commerce," the Court interpreted &#167; 2 as implementing Congress' intent "to exercise [its] commerce power to the full." &lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 277.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instant case, of course, involves not the basic coverage authorization under &#167; 2 of the Act, but the exemption from coverage under &#167; 1. The exemption clause provides the Act shall not apply "to contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce." 9 U. S. C. &#167; 1. Most Courts of Appeals conclude the exclusion provision is limited to transportation workers, defined, for instance, as those workers "`actually engaged in the movement of goods in interstate commerce.' " &lt;i&gt;Cole, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 1471. As we stated at the outset, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit takes a different view and interprets the &#167; 1 exception to exclude all contracts of employment from the reach of the FAA. This comprehensive exemption had been advocated by &lt;i&gt;amici curiae&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Gilmer,&lt;/i&gt; where we addressed the question whether a registered securities representative's employment discrimination claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 621 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; could be submitted to arbitration pursuant to an agreement in his securities registration application. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*113&lt;/span&gt; Concluding that the application was not a "contract of employment" at all, we found it unnecessary to reach the meaning of &#167; 1. See &lt;i&gt;Gilmer, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 25, n. 2. There is no such dispute in this case; while Circuit City argued in its petition for certiorari that the employment application signed by Adams was not a "contract of employment," we declined to grant certiorari on this point. So the issue reserved in &lt;i&gt;Gilmer&lt;/i&gt; is presented here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent, at the outset, contends that we need not address the meaning of the &#167; 1 exclusion provision to decide the case in his favor. In his view, an employment contract is not a "contract evidencing a transaction involving interstate commerce" at all, since the word "transaction" in &#167; 2 extends only to commercial contracts. See &lt;i&gt;Craft,&lt;/i&gt; 177 F. 3d, at 1085 (concluding that &#167; 2 covers only "commercial deal[s] or merchant's sale[s]"). This line of reasoning proves too much, for it would make the &#167; 1 exclusion provision superfluous. If all contracts of employment are beyond the scope of the Act under the &#167; 2 coverage provision, the separate exemption for "contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in . . . interstate commerce" would be pointless. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pennsylvania Dept. of Public Welfare&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Davenport,&lt;/i&gt; 495 U. S. 552, 562 (1990) ("Our cases express a deep reluctance to interpret a statutory provision so as to render superfluous other provisions in the same enactment"). The proffered interpretation of "evidencing a transaction involving commerce," furthermore, would be inconsistent with &lt;i&gt;Gilmer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 500 U. S. 20 (1991), where we held that &#167; 2 required the arbitration of an age discrimination claim based on an agreement in a securities registration application, a dispute that did not arise from a "commercial deal or merchant's sale." Nor could respondent's construction of &#167; 2 be reconciled with the expansive reading of those words adopted in &lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce,&lt;/i&gt; 513 U. S., at 277, 279-280. If, then, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*114&lt;/span&gt; there is an argument to be made that arbitration agreements in employment contracts are not covered by the Act, it must be premised on the language of the &#167; 1 exclusion provision itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent, endorsing the reasoning of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that the provision excludes all employment contracts, relies on the asserted breadth of the words "contracts of employment of . . . any other class of workers engaged in . . . commerce." Referring to our construction of &#167; 2's coverage provision in &lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce&lt;/i&gt; &#151;concluding that the words "involving commerce" evidence the congressional intent to regulate to the full extent of its commerce power&#151;respondent contends &#167; 1's interpretation should have a like reach, thus exempting all employment contracts. The two provisions, it is argued, are coterminous; under this view the "involving commerce" provision brings within the FAA's scope all contracts within the Congress' commerce power, and the "engaged in . . . commerce" language in &#167; 1 in turn exempts from the FAA all employment contracts falling within that authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reading of &#167; 1, however, runs into an immediate and, in our view, insurmountable textual obstacle. Unlike the "involving commerce" language in &#167; 2, the words "any other class of workers engaged in . . . commerce" constitute a residual phrase, following, in the same sentence, explicit reference to "seamen" and "railroad employees." Construing the residual phrase to exclude all employment contracts fails to give independent effect to the statute's enumeration of the specific categories of workers which precedes it; there would be no need for Congress to use the phrases "seamen" and "railroad employees" if those same classes of workers were subsumed within the meaning of the "engaged in . . . commerce" residual clause. The wording of &#167; 1 calls for the application of the maxim &lt;i&gt;ejusdem generis,&lt;/i&gt; the statutory canon that "[w]here general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*115&lt;/span&gt; embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words." 2A N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction &#167; 47.17 (1991); see also &lt;i&gt;Norfolk &amp;amp; Western R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Train Dispatchers,&lt;/i&gt; 499 U. S. 117, 129 (1991). Under this rule of construction the residual clause should be read to give effect to the terms "seamen" and "railroad employees," and should itself be controlled and defined by reference to the enumerated categories of workers which are recited just before it; the interpretation of the clause pressed by respondent fails to produce these results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canons of construction need not be conclusive and are often countered, of course, by some maxim pointing in a different direction. The application of the rule &lt;i&gt;ejusdem generis&lt;/i&gt; in this case, however, is in full accord with other sound considerations bearing upon the proper interpretation of the clause. For even if the term "engaged in commerce" stood alone in &#167; 1, we would not construe the provision to exclude all contracts of employment from the FAA. Congress uses different modifiers to the word "commerce" in the design and enactment of its statutes. The phrase "affecting commerce" indicates Congress' intent to regulate to the outer limits of its authority under the Commerce Clause. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce,&lt;/i&gt; 513 U. S., at 277. The "involving commerce" phrase, the operative words for the reach of the basic coverage provision in &#167; 2, was at issue in &lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce.&lt;/i&gt; That particular phrase had not been interpreted before by this Court. Considering the usual meaning of the word "involving," and the pro-arbitration purposes of the FAA, &lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce&lt;/i&gt; held the "word `involving,' like `affecting,' signals an intent to exercise Congress' commerce power to the full." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Unlike those phrases, however, the general words "in commerce" and the specific phrase "engaged in commerce" are understood to have a more limited reach. In &lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce&lt;/i&gt;  itself the Court said the words "in commerce" are "oftenfound words of art" that we have not read as expressing &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*116&lt;/span&gt; congressional intent to regulate to the outer limits of authority under the Commerce Clause. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 273; see also &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Building Maintenance Industries,&lt;/i&gt; 422 U. S. 271, 279-280 (1975) (phrase "engaged in commerce" is "a term of art, indicating a limited assertion of federal jurisdiction"); &lt;i&gt;Jones&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S. 848, 855 (2000) (phrase "used in commerce" "is most sensibly read to mean active employment for commercial purposes, and not merely a passive, passing, or past connection to commerce").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is argued that we should assess the meaning of the phrase "engaged in commerce" in a different manner here, because the FAA was enacted when congressional authority to regulate under the commerce power was to a large extent confined by our decisions. See &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lopez,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S. 549, 556 (1995) (noting that Supreme Court decisions beginning in 1937 "ushered in an era of Commerce Clause jurisprudence that greatly expanded the previously defined authority of Congress under that Clause"). When the FAA was enacted in 1925, respondent reasons, the phrase "engaged in commerce" was not a term of art indicating a limited assertion of congressional jurisdiction; to the contrary, it is said, the formulation came close to expressing the outer limits of Congress' power as then understood. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Employers' Liability Cases,&lt;/i&gt; 207 U. S. 463, 498 (1908) (holding unconstitutional jurisdictional provision in Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA) covering the employees of "every common carrier engaged in trade or commerce"); &lt;i&gt;Second Employers' Liability Cases,&lt;/i&gt; 223 U. S. 1, 48-49 (1912); but cf. &lt;i&gt;Illinois Central R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Behrens,&lt;/i&gt; 233 U. S. 473 (1914) (noting in dicta that the amended FELA's application to common carriers "while engaging in commerce" did not reach all employment relationships within Congress' commerce power). Were this mode of interpretation to prevail, we would take into account the scope of the Commerce Clause, as then elaborated by the Court, at the date of the FAA's enactment in order to interpret what the statute means now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*117&lt;/span&gt; A variable standard for interpreting common, jurisdictional phrases would contradict our earlier cases and bring instability to statutory interpretation. The Court has declined in past cases to afford significance, in construing the meaning of the statutory jurisdictional provisions "in commerce" and "engaged in commerce," to the circumstance that the statute predated shifts in the Court's Commerce Clause cases. In &lt;i&gt;FTC&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bunte Brothers, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 312 U. S. 349 (1941), the Court rejected the contention that the phrase "in commerce" in &#167; 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 38 Stat. 719, 15 U. S. C. &#167; 45, a provision enacted by Congress in 1914, should be read in as expansive a manner as "affecting commerce." See &lt;i&gt;Bunte Bros., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 350-351. We entertained a similar argument in a pair of cases decided in the 1974 Term concerning the meaning of the phrase "engaged in commerce" in &#167; 7 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, 15 U. S. C. &#167; 18, another 1914 congressional enactment. See &lt;i&gt;American Building Maintenance, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 277-283; &lt;i&gt;Gulf Oil Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Copp Paving Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 419 U. S. 186, 199-202 (1974). We held that the phrase "engaged in commerce" in &#167; 7 "means engaged in the flow of interstate commerce, and was not intended to reach all corporations engaged in activities subject to the federal commerce power." &lt;i&gt;American Building Maintenance, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 283; cf.&lt;i&gt;Gulf Oil, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 202 (expressing doubt as to whether an "argument from the history and practical purposes of the Clayton Act" could justify "radical expansion of the Clayton Act's scope beyond that which the statutory language defines").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court's reluctance to accept contentions that Congress used the words "in commerce" or "engaged in commerce" to regulate to the full extent of its commerce power rests on sound foundation, as it affords objective and consistent significance to the meaning of the words Congress uses when it defines the reach of a statute. To say that the statutory words "engaged in commerce" are subject to variable interpretations depending upon the date of adoption, even a date &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*118&lt;/span&gt; before the phrase became a term of art, ignores the reason why the formulation became a term of art in the first place: The plain meaning of the words "engaged in commerce" is narrower than the more open-ended formulations "affecting commerce" and "involving commerce." See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gulf Oil, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 195 (phrase "engaged in commerce" "appears to denote only persons or activities within the flow of interstate commerce"). It would be unwieldy for Congress, for the Court, and for litigants to be required to deconstruct statutory Commerce Clause phrases depending upon the year of a particular statutory enactment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In rejecting the contention that the meaning of the phrase "engaged in commerce" in &#167; 1 of the FAA should be given a broader construction than justified by its evident language simply because it was enacted in 1925 rather than 1938, we do not mean to suggest that statutory jurisdictional formulations "necessarily have a uniform meaning whenever used by Congress." &lt;i&gt;American Building Maintenance Industries, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 277. As the Court has noted: "The judicial task in marking out the extent to which Congress has exercised its constitutional power over commerce is not that of devising an abstract formula." &lt;i&gt;A. B. Kirschbaum Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Walling,&lt;/i&gt; 316 U. S. 517, 520 (1942). We must, of course, construe the "engaged in commerce" language in the FAA with reference to the statutory context in which it is found and in a manner consistent with the FAA's purpose. These considerations, however, further compel that the &#167; 1 exclusion provision be afforded a narrow construction. As discussed above, the location of the phrase "any other class of workers engaged in . . . commerce" in a residual provision, after specific categories of workers have been enumerated, undermines any attempt to give the provision a sweeping, openended construction. And the fact that the provision is contained in a statute that "seeks broadly to overcome judicial hostility to arbitration agreements," &lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce,&lt;/i&gt; 513 U. S., at 272-273, which the Court concluded in &lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce&lt;/i&gt; counseled &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*119&lt;/span&gt; in favor of an expansive reading of &#167; 2, gives no reason to abandon the precise reading of a provision that exempts contracts from the FAA's coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, the text of the FAA forecloses the construction of &#167; 1 followed by the Court of Appeals in the case under review, a construction which would exclude all employment contracts from the FAA. While the historical arguments respecting Congress' understanding of its power in 1925 are not insubstantial, this fact alone does not give us basis to adopt, "by judicial decision rather than amendatory legislation," &lt;i&gt;Gulf Oil, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 202, an expansive construction of the FAA's exclusion provision that goes beyond the meaning of the words Congress used. While it is of course possible to speculate that Congress might have chosen a different jurisdictional formulation had it known that the Court would soon embrace a less restrictive reading of the Commerce Clause, the text of &#167; 1 precludes interpreting the exclusion provision to defeat the language of &#167; 2 as to all employment contracts. Section 1 exempts from the FAA only contracts of employment of transportation workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;C&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the conclusion we reach today is directed by the text of &#167; 1, we need not assess the legislative history of the exclusion provision. See &lt;i&gt;Ratzlaf&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 510 U. S. 135, 147&#151; 148 (1994) ("[W]e do not resort to legislative history to cloud a statutory text that is clear"). We do note, however, that the legislative record on the &#167; 1 exemption is quite sparse. Respondent points to no language in either Committee Report addressing the meaning of the provision, nor to any mention of the &#167; 1 exclusion during debate on the FAA on the floor of the House or Senate. Instead, respondent places greatest reliance upon testimony before a Senate subcommittee hearing suggesting that the exception may have been added in response to the objections of the president of the International Seamen's Union of America. See Hearing on &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*120&lt;/span&gt; S. 4213 and S. 4214 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 67th Cong., 4th Sess., 9 (1923). Legislative history is problematic even when the attempt is to draw inferences from the intent of duly appointed committees of the Congress. It becomes far more so when we consult sources still more steps removed from the full Congress and speculate upon the significance of the fact that a certain interest group sponsored or opposed particular legislation. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Kelly&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Robinson,&lt;/i&gt; 479 U. S. 36, 51, n. 13 (1986) ("[N]one of those statements was made by a Member of Congress, nor were they included in the official Senate and House Reports. We decline to accord any significance to these statements"). We ought not attribute to Congress an official purpose based on the motives of a particular group that lobbied for or against a certain proposal&#151;even assuming the precise intent of the group can be determined, a point doubtful both as a general rule and in the instant case. It is for the Congress, not the courts, to consult political forces and then decide how best to resolve conflicts in the course of writing the objective embodiments of law we know as statutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor can we accept respondent's argument that our holding attributes an irrational intent to Congress. "Under petitioner's reading of &#167; 1," he contends, "those employment contracts &lt;i&gt;most&lt;/i&gt; involving interstate commerce, and thus most assuredly within the Commerce Clause power in 1925 . . . are &lt;i&gt;excluded&lt;/i&gt; from [the] Act's coverage; while those employment contracts having a &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; direct and less certain connection to interstate commerce . . . would come &lt;i&gt;within&lt;/i&gt; the Act's affirmative coverage and would not be excluded." Brief for Respondent 38 (emphases in original).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see no paradox in the congressional decision to exempt the workers over whom the commerce power was most apparent. To the contrary, it is a permissible inference that the employment contracts of the classes of workers in &#167; 1 were excluded from the FAA precisely because of Congress' undoubted authority to govern the employment relationships &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*121&lt;/span&gt; at issue by the enactment of statutes specific to them. By the time the FAA was passed, Congress had already enacted federal legislation providing for the arbitration of disputes between seamen and their employers, see Shipping Commissioners Act of 1872, 17 Stat. 262. When the FAA was adopted, moreover, grievance procedures existed for railroad employees under federal law, see Transportation Act of 1920, &#167;&#167; 300-316, 41 Stat. 456, and the passage of a more comprehensive statute providing for the mediation and arbitration of railroad labor disputes was imminent, see Railway Labor Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 577, 46 U. S. C. &#167; 651 (repealed). It is reasonable to assume that Congress excluded "seamen" and "railroad employees" from the FAA for the simple reason that it did not wish to unsettle established or developing statutory dispute resolution schemes covering specific workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the residual exclusion of "any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce," Congress' demonstrated concern with transportation workers and their necessary role in the free flow of goods explains the linkage to the two specific, enumerated types of workers identified in the preceding portion of the sentence. It would be rational for Congress to ensure that workers in general would be covered by the provisions of the FAA, while reserving for itself more specific legislation for those engaged in transportation. See &lt;i&gt;Pryner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tractor Supply Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 109 F. 3d, at 358 (Posner, C. J.). Indeed, such legislation was soon to follow, with the amendment of the Railway Labor Act in 1936 to include air carriers and their employees, see 49 Stat. 1189, 45 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 181-188.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various &lt;i&gt;amici,&lt;/i&gt; including the attorneys general of 21 States, object that the reading of the &#167; 1 exclusion provision adopted today intrudes upon the policies of the separate States. They point out that, by requiring arbitration agreements in most employment contracts to be covered by the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*122&lt;/span&gt; FAA, the statute in effect pre-empts those state employment laws which restrict or limit the ability of employees and employers to enter into arbitration agreements. It is argued that States should be permitted, pursuant to their traditional role in regulating employment relationships, to prohibit employees like respondent from contracting away their right to pursue state-law discrimination claims in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not our holding today which is the proper target of this criticism. The line of argument is relevant instead to the Court's decision in &lt;i&gt;Southland Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Keating,&lt;/i&gt; 465 U. S. 1 (1984), holding that Congress intended the FAA to apply in state courts, and to pre-empt state antiarbitration laws to the contrary. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of &lt;i&gt;Southland&lt;/i&gt; `s continuing vitality was given explicit consideration in &lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce,&lt;/i&gt; and the Court declined to overrule it. 513 U. S., at 272; see also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 282 (O'Connor, J., concurring). The decision, furthermore, is not directly implicated in this case, which concerns the application of the FAA in a federal, rather than in a state, court. The Court should not chip away at &lt;i&gt;Southland&lt;/i&gt; by indirection, especially by the adoption of the variable statutory interpretation theory advanced by the respondent in the instant case. Not all of the Justices who join today's holding agreed with &lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce,&lt;/i&gt; see 513 U. S., at 284 (Scalia, J., dissenting); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 285 (Thomas, J., dissenting), but it would be incongruous to adopt, as we did in &lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce,&lt;/i&gt; a conventional reading of the FAA's coverage in &#167; 2 in order to implement proarbitration policies and an unconventional reading of the reach of &#167; 1 in order to undo the same coverage. In &lt;i&gt;AlliedBruce&lt;/i&gt; the Court noted that Congress had not moved to overturn &lt;i&gt;Southland,&lt;/i&gt; see 513 U. S., at 272; and we now note that it has not done so in response to &lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce&lt;/i&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, for parties to employment contracts not involving the specific exempted categories set forth in &#167; 1, it is true here, just as it was for the parties to the contract at issue in &lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce,&lt;/i&gt; that there are real benefits to the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*123&lt;/span&gt; enforcement of arbitration provisions. We have been clear in rejecting the supposition that the advantages of the arbitration process somehow disappear when transferred to the employment context. See &lt;i&gt;Gilmer,&lt;/i&gt; 500 U. S., at 30-32. Arbitration agreements allow parties to avoid the costs of litigation, a benefit that may be of particular importance in employment litigation, which often involves smaller sums of money than disputes concerning commercial contracts. These litigation costs to parties (and the accompanying burden to the courts) would be compounded by the difficult choice-of-law questions that are often presented in disputes arising from the employment relationship, cf. &lt;i&gt;Egelhoff&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Egelhoff, post,&lt;/i&gt; at 149 (noting possible "choice-of-law problems" presented by state laws affecting administration of Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 plans), and the necessity of bifurcation of proceedings in those cases where state law precludes arbitration of certain types of employment claims but not others. The considerable complexity and uncertainty that the construction of &#167; 1 urged by respondent would introduce into the enforceability of arbitration agreements in employment contracts would call into doubt the efficacy of alternative dispute resolution procedures adopted by many of the Nation's employers, in the process undermining the FAA's proarbitration purposes and "breeding litigation from a statute that seeks to avoid it." &lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 275. The Court has been quite specific in holding that arbitration agreements can be enforced under the FAA without contravening the policies of congressional enactments giving employees specific protection against discrimination prohibited by federal law; as we noted in &lt;i&gt;Gilmer,&lt;/i&gt; "`[b]y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum.' " 500 U. S., at 26 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Mitsubishi Motors Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 473 U. S. 614, 628 (1985)). &lt;i&gt;Gilmer,&lt;/i&gt; of course, involved a federal &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*124&lt;/span&gt; statute, while the argument here is that a state statute ought not be denied state judicial enforcement while awaiting the outcome of arbitration. That matter, though, was addressed in &lt;i&gt;Southland&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce,&lt;/i&gt; and we do not revisit the question here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer join, and with whom Justice Souter joins as to Parts II and III, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Souter has cogently explained why the Court's parsimonious construction of &#167; 1 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act) is not consistent with its expansive reading of &#167; 2. I join his dissent, but believe that the Court's heavy reliance on the views expressed by the Courts of Appeals during the past decade makes it appropriate to comment on three earlier chapters in the history of this venerable statute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 2 of the FAA makes enforceable written agreements to arbitrate "in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce." 9 U. S. C. &#167; 2. If we were writing on a clean slate, there would be good reason to conclude that neither the phrase "maritime transaction" nor the phrase "contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce" was intended to encompass employment contracts.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*125&lt;/span&gt; The history of the Act, which is extensive and well documented, makes clear that the FAA was a response to the refusal of courts to enforce commercial arbitration agreements, which were commonly used in the maritime context. The original bill was drafted by the Committee on Commerce, Trade, and Commercial Law of the American Bar Association (ABA) upon consideration of "the further extension of the principle of &lt;i&gt;commercial&lt;/i&gt; arbitration." Report of the Forty-third Annual Meeting of the ABA, 45 A. B. A. Rep. 75 (1920) (emphasis added). As drafted, the bill was understood by Members of Congress to "simply provid[e] for one thing, and that is to give an opportunity to enforce an agreement in &lt;i&gt;commercial&lt;/i&gt; contracts and &lt;i&gt;admiralty&lt;/i&gt; contracts." 65 Cong. Rec. 1931 (1924) (remarks of Rep. Graham) (emphasis added).&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; It is no surprise, then, that when the legislation &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*126&lt;/span&gt; was first introduced in 1922,&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; it did not mention employment contracts, but did contain a rather precise definition of the term "maritime transactions" that underscored the commercial character of the proposed bill.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; Indeed, neither the history of the drafting of the original bill by the ABA, nor the records of the deliberations in Congress during the years preceding the ultimate enactment of the Act in 1925, contain any evidence that the proponents of the legislation intended it to apply to agreements affecting employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the original bill was opposed by representatives of organized labor, most notably the president of the International Seamen's Union of America,&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; because of their &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*127&lt;/span&gt; concern that the legislation might authorize federal judicial enforcement of arbitration clauses in employment contracts and collective-bargaining agreements.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; In response to those objections, the chairman of the ABA committee that drafted the legislation emphasized at a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing that "[i]t is not intended that this shall be an act referring to labor disputes, at all," but he also observed that "if your honorable committee should feel that there is any danger of that, they should add to the bill the following language, `but nothing herein contained shall apply to seamen or any class of workers in interstate and foreign commerce.' " Hearing 9. Similarly, another supporter of the bill, then Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, suggested that "[i]f objection appears to the inclusion of workers' contracts in the law's scheme, it might be well amended by stating `but nothing herein contained shall apply to contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in interstate or foreign commerce.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 14. The legislation was reintroduced in the next session of Congress with Secretary Hoover's exclusionary language added to &#167; 1,&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; and the amendment eliminated organized labor's opposition to the proposed law.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*128&lt;/span&gt; That amendment is what the Court construes today. History amply supports the proposition that it was an uncontroversial provision that merely confirmed the fact that no one interested in the enactment of the FAA ever intended or expected that &#167; 2 would apply to employment contracts. It is particularly ironic, therefore, that the amendment has provided the Court with its sole justification for refusing to give the text of &#167; 2 a natural reading. Playing ostrich to the substantial history behind the amendment, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 119 ("[W]e need not assess the legislative history of the exclusion provision"), the Court reasons in a vacuum that "[i]f all contracts of employment are beyond the scope of the Act under the &#167; 2 coverage provision, the separate exemption" in &#167; 1 "would be pointless," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 113. But contrary to the Court's suggestion, it is not "pointless" to adopt a clarifying amendment in order to eliminate opposition to a bill. Moreover, the majority's reasoning is squarely contradicted by the Court's approach in &lt;i&gt;Bernhardt&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Polygraphic Co. of America,&lt;/i&gt; 350 U. S. 198, 200, 201, n. 3 (1956), where the Court concluded that an employment contract did not "evidence `a transaction involving commerce' within the meaning of &#167; 2 of the Act," and therefore did not "reach the further question whether in any event petitioner would be included in `any other class of workers' within the exceptions of &#167; 1 of the Act."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony of the Court's reading of &#167; 2 to include contracts of employment is compounded by its cramped interpretation of the exclusion inserted into &#167; 1. As proposed and enacted, the exclusion fully responded to the concerns of the Seamen's Union and other labor organizations that &#167; 2 might encompass &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*129&lt;/span&gt; employment contracts by expressly exempting the labor agreements not only of "seamen" and "railroad employees," but also of &lt;i&gt;"any other class of workers&lt;/i&gt; engaged in foreign or interstate commerce." 9 U. S. C. &#167; 1 (emphasis added). Today, however, the Court fulfills the original&#151;and originally unfounded&#151;fears of organized labor by essentially rewriting the text of &#167; 1 to exclude the employment contracts &lt;i&gt;solely&lt;/i&gt; of "seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of &lt;i&gt;[transportation]&lt;/i&gt; workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce." See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 119. In contrast, whether one views the legislation before or after the amendment to &#167; 1, it is clear that it was not intended to apply to employment contracts at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quarter century after the FAA was passed, many Courts of Appeals were presented with the question whether collective-bargaining agreements were "contracts of employment" for purposes of &#167; 1's exclusion. The courts split over that question, with at least the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Circuits answering in the affirmative,&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; and the First and Sixth Circuits answering in the negative.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; Most of these cases neither involved employees engaged in transportation nor turned on whether the workers were so occupied. Indeed, the general assumption seemed to be, as the Sixth Circuit stated early on, that &#167; 1 "was deliberately worded by the Congress to exclude from the [FAA] all contracts of employment &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*130&lt;/span&gt; of workers engaged in interstate commerce." &lt;i&gt;Gatliff Coal Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cox,&lt;/i&gt; 142 F. 2d 876, 882 (1944).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contrary view that the Court endorses today&#151;namely, that only employees engaged in interstate transportation are excluded by &#167; 1&#151;was not expressed until 1954, by the Third Circuit in &lt;i&gt;Tenney Engineering, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Electrical Workers,&lt;/i&gt;  207 F. 2d 450, 452 (1953). And that decision, significantly, was rejected shortly thereafter by the Fourth Circuit. See &lt;i&gt;Electrical Workers&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Miller Metal Products, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 215 F. 2d 221, 224 (1954). The conflict among the Circuits that persisted in the 1950's thus suggests that it may be inappropriate to attach as much weight to recent Court of Appeals opinions as the Court does in this case. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 109, 110-111, 112.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more important than the 1950's conflict, however, is the way in which this Court tried to resolve the debate. In &lt;i&gt;Textile Workers&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lincoln Mills of Ala.,&lt;/i&gt; 353 U. S. 448 (1957), the Court granted certiorari to consider the union's claim that, in a suit brought under &#167; 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), a federal court may enforce the arbitration clause in a collective-bargaining agreement. The union argued that such authority was implicitly granted by &#167; 301 and explicitly granted by &#167; 2 of the FAA. In support of the latter argument, the union asked the Court to rule either that a collective-bargaining agreement is not a "contrac[t] of employment" within the meaning of the exclusion in &#167; 1, or that the exclusion is limited to transportation workers.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; The Court did not accept either argument, but held that &#167; 301 itself provided the authority to compel arbitration. The fact that the Court relied on &#167; 301 of the LMRA, a statutory provision that does not mention arbitration, rather than the FAA, a statute that expressly authorizes the enforcement of arbitration agreements, strongly implies that the Court had concluded that the FAA simply did &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*131&lt;/span&gt; not apply because &#167; 1 exempts labor contracts. That was how Justice Frankfurter, who of course was present during the deliberations on the case, explained the disposition of the FAA issues. See 353 U. S., at 466-468 (dissenting opinion).&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Justice Frankfurter's description of the majority's rejection of the applicability of the FAA does not suffice to establish &lt;i&gt;Textile Workers&lt;/i&gt; as precedent for the meaning of &#167; 1, his opinion unquestionably reveals his own interpretation of the Act. Moreover, given that Justice Marshall and I have also subscribed to that reading of &#167; 1,&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt; and that three more Members of this Court do so in dissenting from today's decision, it follows that more Justices have endorsed that view than the one the Court now adopts. That fact, of course, does not control the disposition of this case, but it does seem to me that it is entitled to at least as much respect as the number of Court of Appeals decisions to which the Court repeatedly refers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Times have changed. Judges in the 19th century disfavored private arbitration. The 1925 Act was intended to overcome that attitude, but a number of this Court's cases decided in the last several decades have pushed the pendulum &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*132&lt;/span&gt; far beyond a neutral attitude and endorsed a policy that strongly favors private arbitration.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; The strength of that policy preference has been echoed in the recent Court of Appeals opinions on which the Court relies.&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt; In a sense, therefore, the Court is standing on its own shoulders when it points to those cases as the basis for its narrow construction of the exclusion in &#167; 1. There is little doubt that the Court's interpretation of the Act has given it a scope far beyond the expectations of the Congress that enacted it. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Southland Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Keating,&lt;/i&gt; 465 U. S. 1, 17-21 (1984) (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 21-36 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not necessarily wrong for the Court to put its own imprint on a statute. But when its refusal to look beyond the raw statutory text enables it to disregard countervailing considerations that were expressed by Members of the enacting Congress and that remain valid today, the Court misuses its authority. As the history of the legislation indicates, the potential disparity in bargaining power between individual employees and large employers was the source of organized labor's opposition to the Act, which it feared would require courts to enforce unfair employment contracts. That same concern, as Justice Souter points out, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt;  at 138, n. 2, underlay Congress' exemption of contracts of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*133&lt;/span&gt; employment from mandatory arbitration. When the Court simply ignores the interest of the unrepresented employee, it skews its interpretation with its own policy preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case illustrates the wisdom of an observation made by Justice Aharon Barak of the Supreme Court of Israel. He has perceptively noted that the "minimalist" judge "who holds that the purpose of the statute may be learned only from its language" has more discretion than the judge "who will seek guidance from every reliable source." Judicial Discretion 62 (Y. Kaufmann transl. 1989). A method of statutory interpretation that is deliberately uninformed, and hence unconstrained, may produce a result that is consistent with a court's own views of how things should be, but it may also defeat the very purpose for which a provision was enacted. That is the sad result in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act) provides for the enforceability of a written arbitration clause in "any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce," 9 U. S. C. &#167; 2, while &#167; 1 exempts from the Act's coverage "contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce." Whatever the understanding of Congress's implied admiralty power may have been when the Act was passed in 1925, the commerce power was then thought to be far narrower than we have subsequently come to see it. As a consequence, there are two quite different ways of reading the scope of the Act's provisions. One way would be to say, for example, that the coverage provision extends only to those contracts "involving commerce" that were understood to be covered in 1925; the other would be to read it as exercising Congress's commerce jurisdiction in its modern conception in the same way it was &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*134&lt;/span&gt; thought to implement the more limited view of the Commerce Clause in 1925. The first possibility would result in a statutory ambit frozen in time, behooving Congress to amend the statute whenever it desired to expand arbitration clause enforcement beyond its scope in 1925; the second would produce an elastic reach, based on an understanding that Congress used language intended to go as far as Congress could go, whatever that might be over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dobson,&lt;/i&gt; 513 U. S. 265 (1995), we decided that the elastic understanding of &#167; 2 was the more sensible way to give effect to what Congress intended when it legislated to cover contracts "involving commerce," a phrase that we found an apt way of providing that coverage would extend to the outer constitutional limits under the Commerce Clause. The question here is whether a similarly general phrase in the &#167; 1 exemption, referring to contracts of "any . . . class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce," should receive a correspondingly evolutionary reading, so as to expand the exemption for employment contracts to keep pace with the enhanced reach of the general enforceability provision. If it is tempting to answer yes, on the principle that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, it is sobering to realize that the Courts of Appeals have, albeit with some fits and starts as noted by Justice Stevens, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 129-130 (dissenting opinion),&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; overwhelmingly rejected the evolutionary reading of &#167; 1 accepted by the Court of Appeals in this case. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 110-111 (opinion of the Court) (citing cases). A majority &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*135&lt;/span&gt; of this Court now puts its &lt;i&gt;imprimatur&lt;/i&gt; on the majority view among the Courts of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of courts arrayed against reading the &#167; 1 exemption in a way that would allow it to grow parallel to the expanding &#167; 2 coverage reflects the fact that this minority view faces two hurdles, each textually based and apparent from the face of the Act. First, the language of coverage (a contract evidencing a transaction "involving commerce") is different from the language of the exemption (a contract of a worker "engaged in . . . commerce"). Second, the "engaged in . . .commerce" catchall phrase in the exemption is placed in the text following more specific exemptions for employment contracts of "seamen" and "railroad employees." The placement possibly indicates that workers who are excused from arbitrating by virtue of the catchall exclusion must resemble seamen and railroad workers, perhaps by being employees who actually handle and move goods as they are shipped interstate or internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither hurdle turns out to be a bar, however. The first objection is at best inconclusive and weaker than the grounds to reject it; the second is even more certainly inapposite, for reasons the Court itself has stated but misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Congress further from a plenary exercise of the commerce power when it deals with contracts of workers "engaged in . . . commerce" than with contracts detailing transactions "involving commerce?" The answer is an easy yes, insofar as the former are only the class of labor contracts, while the latter are not so limited. But that is not the point. The question is whether Congress used language indicating that it meant to cover as many contracts as the Commerce Clause allows it to reach within each class of contracts addressed. In &lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce&lt;/i&gt; we examined the 1925 context and held that "involving commerce" showed just such a plenary intention, even though at the time we decided that case &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*136&lt;/span&gt; we had long understood "affecting commerce" to be the quintessential expression of an intended plenary exercise of commerce power. 513 U. S., at 273-274; see also &lt;i&gt;Wickard&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Filburn,&lt;/i&gt; 317 U. S. 111 (1942).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again looking to the context of the time, I reach the same conclusion about the phrase "engaged in commerce" as a description of employment contracts exempted from the Act. When the Act was passed (and the commerce power was closely confined) our case law indicated that the only employment relationships subject to the commerce power were those in which workers were actually engaged in interstate commerce. Compare &lt;i&gt;The Employers' Liability Cases,&lt;/i&gt; 207 U. S. 463, 496, 498 (1908) (suggesting that regulation of the employment relations of railroad employees "actually engaged in an operation of interstate commerce" is permissible under the Commerce Clause but that regulation of a railroad company's clerical force is not), with &lt;i&gt;Hammer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dagenhart,&lt;/i&gt;  247 U. S. 251, 271-276 (1918) (invalidating statute that had the "necessary effect" of "regulat[ing] the hours of labor of children in factories and mines within the States"). Thus, by using "engaged in" for the exclusion, Congress showed an intent to exclude to the limit of its power to cover employment contracts in the first place, and it did so just as clearly as its use of "involving commerce" showed its intent to legislate to the hilt over commercial contracts at a more general level. That conclusion is in fact borne out by the statement of the then-Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover, who suggested to Congress that the &#167; 1 exclusion language should be adopted "[i]f objection appears to the inclusion of workers' contracts in the law's scheme." Sales and Contracts to Sell in Interstate and Foreign Commerce, and Federal Commercial Arbitration: Hearing on S. 4213 and S. 4214 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 67th Cong., 4th Sess., 14 (1923) (hereinafter Hearing on S. 4213 et al.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*137&lt;/span&gt; The Court cites &lt;i&gt;FTC&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bunte Brothers, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 312 U. S. 349 (1941), &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Building Maintenance Industries,&lt;/i&gt; 422 U. S. 271 (1975), and &lt;i&gt;Gulf Oil Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Copp Paving Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 419 U. S. 186 (1974), for the proposition that "engaged in" has acquired a more restricted meaning as a term of art, immune to tampering now. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 117-118. But none of the cited cases dealt with the question here, whether exemption language is to be read as petrified when coverage language is read to grow. Nor do the cases support the Court's unwillingness to look beyond the four corners of the statute to determine whether the words in question necessarily "`have a uniform meaning whenever used by Congress,' " &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 118 (quoting &lt;i&gt;American Building Maintenance, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 277). Compare &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 119 ("[W]e need not assess the legislative history of the exclusion provision"), with, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;American Building Maintenance, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 279&#151; 283 (examining legislative history and agency enforcement of the Clayton Act before resolving meaning of "engaged in commerce").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court has no good reason, therefore, to reject a reading of "engaged in" as an expression of intent to legislate to the full extent of the commerce power over employment contracts. The statute is accordingly entitled to a coherent reading as a whole, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;King&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;St. Vincent's Hospital,&lt;/i&gt;  502 U. S. 215, 221 (1991), by treating the exemption for employment contracts as keeping pace with the expanded understanding of the commerce power generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second hurdle is cleared more easily still,and the Court has shown how. Like some Courts of Appeals before it, the majority today finds great significance in the fact that the generally phrased exemption for the employment contracts of workers "engaged in commerce" does not stand alone, but occurs at the end of a sequence of more specific &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*138&lt;/span&gt; exemptions: for "contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce." Like those other courts, this Court sees the sequence as an occasion to apply the interpretive maxim of &lt;i&gt;ejusdem generis,&lt;/i&gt; that is, when specific terms are followed by a general one, the latter is meant to cover only examples of the same sort as the preceding specifics. Here, the same sort is thought to be contracts of transportation workers, or employees of transporters, the very carriers of commerce. And that, of course, excludes respondent Adams from benefit of the exemption, for he is employed by a retail seller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many interpretive canons, however, &lt;i&gt;ejusdem generis&lt;/i&gt;  is a fallback, and if there are good reasons not to apply it, it is put aside. &lt;i&gt;E. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Norfolk &amp;amp; Western R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Train Dispatchers,&lt;/i&gt; 499 U. S. 117, 129 (1991).&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; There are good reasons here. As Adams argued, it is imputing something very odd to the working of the congressional brain to say that Congress took care to bar application of the Act to the class of employment contracts it most obviously had authority to legislate about in 1925, contracts of workers employed by carriers and handlers of commerce, while covering only employees "engaged" in less obvious ways, over whose coverage litigation might be anticipated with uncertain results. It would seem to have made more sense either to cover all coverable employment contracts or to exclude them all. In fact, exclusion might well have been in order based on concern that arbitration could prove expensive or unfavorable to employees, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*139&lt;/span&gt; many of whom lack the bargaining power to resist an arbitration clause if their prospective employers insist on one.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; And excluding all employment contracts from the Act's enforcement of mandatory arbitration clauses is consistent with Secretary Hoover's suggestion that the exemption language would respond to any "objection . . . to the inclusion of workers' contracts."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court tries to deflect the anomaly of excluding only carrier contracts by suggesting that Congress used the reference to seamen and rail workers to indicate the class of employees whose employment relations it had already legislated about and would be most likely to legislate about in the future. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 120-121. This explanation, however, does nothing to eliminate the anomaly. On the contrary, the explanation tells us why Congress might have referred specifically to the sea and rail workers; but, if so, it also indicates that Congress almost certainly intended the catchall phrase to be just as broad as its terms, without any interpretive squeeze in the name of &lt;i&gt;ejusdem generis.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very fact, as the Court points out, that Congress already had spoken on the subjects of sailors and rail workers and had tailored the legislation to the particular circumstances of the sea and rail carriers may well have been reason for mentioning them specifically. But making the specific references was in that case an act of special care to make sure that the FAA not be construed to modify the existing legislation so exactly aimed; that was no reason at all to limit the general FAA exclusion from applying to employment &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*140&lt;/span&gt; contracts that had not been targeted with special legislation. Congress did not need to worry especially about the FAA's effect on legislation that did not exist and was not contemplated. As to workers uncovered by any specific legislation, Congress could write on a clean slate, and what it wrote was a general exclusion for employment contracts within Congress's power to regulate. The Court has understood this point before, holding that the existence of a special reason for emphasizing specific examples of a statutory class can negate any inference that an otherwise unqualified general phrase was meant to apply only to matters &lt;i&gt;ejusdem generis.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; On the Court's own reading of the history, then, the explanation for the catchall is not &lt;i&gt;ejusdem generis;&lt;/i&gt; instead, the explanation for the specifics is &lt;i&gt;ex abundanti cautela,&lt;/i&gt; abundance of caution, see &lt;i&gt;Fort Stewart Schools&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;FLRA,&lt;/i&gt; 495 U. S. 641, 646 (1990).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing stands in the way of construing the coverage and exclusion clauses together, consistently and coherently. I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lewis Maltby&lt;/i&gt; filed a brief for the National Workrights Institute as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Doing so, in any event, is not precluded by our decision in &lt;i&gt;Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dobson,&lt;/i&gt; 513 U. S. 265 (1995). While we held that &#167; 2 of the FAA evinces Congress' intent to exercise its full Commerce Clause power, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 277, the case did not involve a contract of employment, nor did it consider whether such contracts fall within either category of &#167; 2's coverage provision, however broadly construed, in light of the legislative history detailed &lt;i&gt;infra&lt;/i&gt; this page and 126-127.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Consistent with this understanding, Rep. Mills, who introduced the original bill in the House, explained that it "provides that where there are &lt;i&gt;commercial&lt;/i&gt; contracts and there is disagreement under the contract, the court can [en]force an arbitration agreement in the same way as other portions of the contract." 65 Cong. Rec., at 11080 (emphasis added). And before the Senate, the chairman of the New York Chamber of Commerce, one of the many business organizations that requested introduction of the bill, testified that it was needed to "enable &lt;i&gt;business men&lt;/i&gt; to settle their disputes expeditiously and economically, and will reduce the congestion in the Federal and State courts." Hearing on S. 4213 and S. 4214 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 67th Cong., 4th Sess., 2 (1923) (Hearing) (emphasis added). See also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 14 (letter of H. Hoover, Secretary of Commerce) ("I have been, as you may know, very strongly impressed with the urgent need of a Federal &lt;i&gt;commercial&lt;/i&gt; arbitration act. The American Bar Association has now joined hands with the business men of this country to the same effect and unanimously approved" the bill drafted by the ABA committee and introduced in both Houses of Congress (emphasis added)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  S. 4214, 67th Cong., 4th Sess. (1922) (S. 4214); H. R. 13522, 67th Cong., 4th Sess. (1922) (H. R. 13522). See 64 Cong. Rec. 732, 797 (1922).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  "[M]aritime transactions" was defined as "charter parties, bills of lading of water carriers, agreements relating to wharfage, supplies furnished vessels or repairs to vessels, seamen's wages, collisions, or any other matters in foreign or interstate commerce which, if the subject of controversy, would be embraced within admiralty jurisdiction." S. 4214, &#167; 1; H. R. 13522, &#167; 1. Although there was no illustrative definition of "contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce," the draft defined "commerce" as "commerce among the several States or with foreign nations, or in any Territory of the United States or in the District of Columbia, or between any such Territory and another, or between any such Territory and any State or foreign nation, or between the District of Columbia and any State or Territory or foreign nation." S. 4214, &#167; 1; H. R. 13522, &#167; 1. Considered together, these definitions embrace maritime and nonmaritime commercial transactions, and with one possible exception do not remotely suggest coverage of employment contracts. That exception, "seamen's wages," was eliminated by the time the bill was reintroduced in the next session of Congress, when the exclusions in &#167; 1 were added. See Joint Hearings on S. 1005 and H. R. 646 before the Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1924) (Joint Hearings); see also &lt;i&gt;infra,&lt;/i&gt;  at 127. These definitions were enacted as amended and remain essentially the same today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  He stated:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[T]his bill provides for reintroduction of forced or involuntary labor, if the freeman through his necessities shall be induced to sign. Will such contracts be signed? Esau agreed, because he was hungry. It was the desire to live that caused slavery to begin and continue. With the growing hunger in modern society, there will be but few that will be able to resist. The personal hunger of the &lt;i&gt;seaman,&lt;/i&gt; and the hunger of the wife and children of the &lt;i&gt;railroad man&lt;/i&gt; will surely tempt them to sign, and so with &lt;i&gt;sundry other workers in `Interstate and Foreign Commerce.&lt;/i&gt; ` " Proceedings of the Twenty-sixth Annual Convention of the International Seamen's Union of America 203-204 (1923) (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[7]  See Joint Hearings 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  Indeed, in a postenactment comment on the amendment, the Executive Council of the American Federation of Labor reported:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Protests from the American Federation of Labor and the International Seamen's Union brought an amendment which provided that `nothing herein contained shall apply to contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employes or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.' This exempted labor from the provisions of the law, although its sponsors denied there was any intention to include labor disputes."

Apparently, two other Circuits shared this view.

&lt;p&gt;[12]  In Justice Frankfurter's words, "Naturally enough, I find rejection, though not explicit, of the availability of the Federal Arbitration Act to enforce arbitration clauses in collectivebargaining agreements in the silent treatment given that Act by the Court's opinion. If an Act that authorizes the federal courts to enforce arbitration provisions in contracts generally, but specifically denies authority to decree that remedy for `contracts of employment,' were available, the Court would hardly spin such power out of the empty darkness of &#167; 301. I would make this rejection explicit, recognizing that when Congress passed legislation to enable arbitration agreements to be enforced by the federal courts, it saw fit to exclude this remedy with respect to labor contracts." &lt;i&gt;Textile Workers&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lincoln Mills of Ala.,&lt;/i&gt; 353 U. S., at 466 (dissenting opinion).&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, those courts have limited the section 1 exemption to seamen, railroad workers, and other workers actually involved in the interstate transportation of goods").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Compare, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Asplundh Tree Expert Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bates,&lt;/i&gt; 71 F. 3d 592, 600&#151; 601 (CA6 1995) (construing exclusion narrowly), with &lt;i&gt;Willis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dean Witter Reynolds,&lt;/i&gt; 948 F. 2d 305, 311-312 (CA6 1991) (concluding, in dicta, that contracts of employment are generally excluded), and &lt;i&gt;Gatliff Coal Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cox,&lt;/i&gt; 142 F. 2d 876, 882 (CA6 1944) ("[T]he Arbitration Act excluded employment contracts").

&lt;p&gt;[2]  What is more, the Court has repeatedly explained that the canon is triggered only by uncertain statutory text, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Garcia&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt;  469 U. S. 70, 74-75 (1984); &lt;i&gt;Gooch&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 297 U. S. 124, 128 (1936), and that it can be overcome by, &lt;i&gt;inter alia,&lt;/i&gt; contrary legislative history, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Watt&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Western Nuclear, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 462 U. S. 36, 44, n. 5 (1983). The Court today turns this practice upside down, using &lt;i&gt;ejusdem generis&lt;/i&gt; to establish that the text is so clear that legislative history is irrelevant. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 119.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Senator Walsh expressed this concern during a subcommittee hearing on the FAA:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"`The trouble about the matter is that a great many of these contracts that are entered into are really not voluntar[y] things at all. .. . It is the same with a good many contracts of employment. A man says, "These are our terms. All right, take it or leave it." Well, there is nothing for the man to do except to sign it; and then he surrenders his right to have his case tried by the court, and has to have ittried before a tribunal in which he has no confidence at all.' " Hearing on S. 4213 et al., at 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  In &lt;i&gt;Watt&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Western Nuclear, Inc., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 44, n. 5, the Court concluded that the &lt;i&gt;ejusdem generis&lt;/i&gt; canon did not apply to the words "coal and other minerals" where "[t]here were special reasons for expressly addressing coal that negate any inference that the phrase `and other minerals' was meant to reserve only substances &lt;i&gt;ejusdem generis,&lt;/i&gt; " namely that Congress wanted "to make clear that coal was reserved even though existing law treated it differently from other minerals."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;David I. Bruck,&lt;/i&gt; by appointment of the Court, 531 U. S. 1009, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs was &lt;i&gt;William N. Nettles.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Donald J. Zelenka,&lt;/i&gt; Assistant Deputy Attorney General of South Carolina, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Charlie Condon,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, &lt;i&gt;John W. McIntosh,&lt;/i&gt; Chief Deputy Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;S. Creighton Waters,&lt;/i&gt; Assistant Attorney General.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Ginsburg, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case concerns the right of a defendant in a capital case to inform the jury that, under the governing state law, he would not be eligible for parole in the event that the jury sentences him to life imprisonment. In &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;South Carolina,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S. 154 (1994), this Court held that where a capital defendant's future dangerousness is at issue, and the only sentencing alternative to death available to the jury is life imprisonment without possibility of parole, due process entitles the defendant "to inform the jury of [his] parole ineligibility, either by a jury instruction or in arguments by counsel." &lt;i&gt;Ramdass&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Angelone,&lt;/i&gt; 530 U. S. 156, 165 (2000) (plurality opinion) (describing &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; ` premise and plurality opinion). The case we now confront involves a death sentence returned by a jury instructed both that "life imprisonment &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*40&lt;/span&gt; means until death of the offender," and that "[p]arole eligibility or ineligibility is not for your consideration." 340 S. C. 291, 297, 531 S. E. 2d 524, 527 (2000). It presents the question whether the South Carolina Supreme Court misread our precedent when it declared &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; inapplicable to South Carolina's current sentencing scheme. We hold that South Carolina's Supreme Court incorrectly limited &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; and therefore reverse that court's judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 1997, in the course of an attempted robbery in Union County, South Carolina, then-18-year-old Wesley Aaron Shafer, Jr., shot and killed a convenience store cashier. A grand jury indicted Shafer on charges of murder, attempted armed robbery, and criminal conspiracy. App. 2-4. Prior to trial, the prosecutor notified Shafer that the State would seek the death penalty for the murder. App. 4-5. In that pursuit, the prosecutor further informed Shafer, the State would present evidence of Shafer's "prior bad acts," as well as his "propensity for [future] violence and unlawful conduct." App. 6, 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under South Carolina law, juries in capital cases consider guilt and sentencing in separate proceedings. S. C. Code Ann. &#167;&#167; 16-3-20(A), (B) (2000 Cum. Supp.). In the initial (guilt phase) proceeding, the jury found Shafer guilty on all three charges. Governing the sentencing proceeding, South Carolina law instructs: "[T]he jury . . . shall hear additional evidence in extenuation, mitigation, or aggravation of the punishment. . .. The State, the defendant, and his counsel are permitted to present arguments for or against the sentence to be imposed." &#167; 16-3-20(B).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under amendments effective January 1, 1996, South Carolina capital jurors face two questions at sentencing. They decide first whether the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of any statutory aggravating circumstance. If the jury fails to agree unanimously on &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*41&lt;/span&gt; the presence of a statutory aggravator, "it shall not make a sentencing recommendation." &#167; 16-3-20(C). "[T]he trial judge," in that event, "shall sentence the defendant to either life imprisonment or a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.;&lt;/i&gt; see &#167; 16-3-20(B). If, on the other hand, the jury unanimously finds a statutory aggravator, it then recommends one of two potential sentences&#151; death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. &#167;&#167; 16-3-20(A), (B). No sentencing option other than death or life without parole is available to the jury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the sentencing proceeding in Shafer's case, the State introduced evidence of his criminal record, past aggressive conduct, probation violations, and misbehavior in prison. The State urged the statutory aggravating circumstance that Shafer had committed the murder in the course of an attempted robbery while armed with a deadly weapon. See &#167; 16-3-20(C)(a)(1)(d). The defense presented evidence of Shafer's abusive childhood and mental problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the completion of the parties' sentencing presentations, the trial judge conducted an &lt;i&gt;in camera&lt;/i&gt; hearing on jury instructions. Shafer's counsel maintained that due process, and our decision in &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;South Carolina,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S. 154 (1994), required the judge to instruct that under South Carolina law a life sentence carries no possibility of parole. The prosecutor, in opposition, urged that Shafer was not entitled to a &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; instruction because "the State has not argued at any point . . . that he would be a danger to anybody in the future, nor will we argue [that] in our closing argument . . . ." App. 161. Shafer's counsel replied: "The State cannot introduce evidence of future dangerousness, and then say we are not going to argue it and [thereby avoid] a charge on the law. . . . They have introduced [evidence of a] post arrest assault, [and] post arrest violations of the rules of the jail . . . . If you put a jailer on to say that [Shafer] is charged with assault . . . on [the jailer], that is future dangerousness." App. 162. Ruling that "the matter of parole &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*42&lt;/span&gt; ineligibility will not be charged," the trial judge stated: "I find that future dangerousness [was] not argued[;] if it's argued [in the prosecutor's closing], it may become different." App. 164.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsuccessful in his effort to gain a court instruction on parole ineligibility, Shafer's counsel sought permission to impart the information to the jury himself. He sought leave to read in his closing argument lines from the controlling statute, &#167; 16-3-20(A), stating plainly that a life sentence in South Carolina carries no possibility of parole. App. 164-165.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; In accord with the State's motion "to prevent the defense from arguing in their closing argument anything to the effect that [Shafer] will never get out of prison," App. 161, the judge denied the defense permission to read the statute's text to the jury. App. 165.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*43&lt;/span&gt; After the prosecution's closing argument, and out of the presence of the jury, Shafer's counsel renewed his plea for "a life without parole charge." App. 188. He referred to his earlier submissions and urged, in addition, that the State had placed future dangerousness at issue during closing argument by repeating the words of an alarmed witness at the crime scene: "[T]hey [Shafer and his two accomplices] might come back, they might come back." App. 188. The trial judge denied the request. The judge "admit[ted he] had some concern [as to whether the State's] argument . . . had crossed the line," but in the end he found "that it comes close, but did not." App. 191-192.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructing the jury, the judge explained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If you do not unanimously find the existence of the aggravating circumstance as set forth on the form [murder during the commission of an attempted armed robbery], you do not need to go any further.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If you find unanimously the existence of a statutory aggravating circumstance . . . you will go further and continue your deliberations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Once you have unanimously found and signed as to the presence of an aggravated circumstance, you then further deliberate, and determine whether or not Wesley Aaron Shafer should be sentence[d] to life imprisonment or death." App. 202.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge twice told the jury, quoting words from &#167; 16-3-20(A), that "life imprisonment means until the death of the defendant." App. 201; see App. 209. In line with his prior rulings, the judge did not instruct that a life sentence, if recommended by the jury, would be without parole. In the concluding portion of his charge, he told the jury that "the sentence you send to me by way of a recommendation will in fact be the sentence that the court imposes on the defendant." App. 215. After the judge instructed the jury, the defense once more renewed its "objection to the statutory &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*44&lt;/span&gt; language [on parole ineligibility] not being charged," App. 221, and the judge again overruled the objection, App. 222.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three hours and twenty-five minutes into its sentencing deliberations, the jury sent a note to the trial judge containing two questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"1) Is there any remote chance for someone convicted of murder to become elig[i]ble for parole?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"2) Under what conditions would someone convicted for murder be elig[i]ble." App. 253.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shafer's counsel urged the court to read to the jury the following portion of &#167; 16-3-20(A):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If the State seeks the death penalty and a statutory aggravating circumstance is found beyond a reasonable doubt . . . and a recommendation of death is not made, the trial judge must impose a sentence of life imprisonment. For purposes of this section, &lt;i&gt;'life imprisonment'&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;means until death of the offender.&lt;/i&gt; No person sen- tenced to life imprisonment pursuant to this section is eligible for parole, community supervision, or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work credits, education credits, good conduct credits, or any other credits that would re- duce the mandatory life imprisonment required by this section." App. 226 (emphasis added).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He argued that the court's charge, which partially quoted from &#167; 16-3-20 (above in italics), but omitted the provision's concluding sentence (above in boldface), had left the jurors confused about Shafer's parole eligibility. App. 226. The State adhered to its position that "the jury should not be informed as to any parole eligibility." App. 223. South Carolina law, the prosecutor insisted, required the judge to "instruct the jury that it shall not consider parole eligibility in reaching its decision, and that the term life imprisonment and a death sentence should be understood in their ordinary and plain meaning." App. 223-224.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*45&lt;/span&gt; The trial judge decided "not . . . to charge the jury about parole ineligibility," App. 229, and informed counsel that he would instruct:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Your consideration is restricted to what sentence to recommend. I will, as trial judge, impose the sentence you recommend. Section 16-3-20 of the South Carolina Code of Laws provides that for the purpose of this section life imprisonment means until the death of the offender. Parole eligibility is not for your consideration." App. 236.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shafer's counsel asked the judge "to take off the language of parole eligibility." App. 236. The statement that "parole eligibility is not to be considered by [the jury]," counsel argued, "impl[ies] that it is available." App. 236; see App. 239 (Shafer's counsel reiterated: "[I]f you tell them they can't consider parole eligibility . . . that certainly implies that he may be eligible.").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following counsels' arguments, and nearly an hour after the jury tendered its questions, the trial judge instructed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Section 16-3-20 of our Code of Laws as applies to this case in the process we're in, states that, quote, for the purposes of this section life imprisonment means until the death of the offender, end quote.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Parole eligibility or ineligibility is not for your consideration." App. 240.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury returned some 80 minutes later. It unanimously found beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating factor of murder while attempting armed robbery, and recommended the death penalty. App. 242-243. The jury was polled, and each member indicated his or her assent to the aggravated circumstance finding and to the death penalty recommendation. App. 243-248. Defense counsel asked that the jury be polled on "the specific question as to whether parole eligibility, their belief therein, gave rise to the verdict," and "whether juror number 233 who works for probation and parole, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*46&lt;/span&gt; expressed personal knowledge in the jury's deliberation outside of the evidence and the law given." App. 248. The judge denied both requests and imposed the death sentence. App. 248, 251.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shafer appealed his death sentence to the South Carolina Supreme Court. Noting our decision in &lt;i&gt;Simmons,&lt;/i&gt; the South Carolina Supreme Court acknowledged that "[w]hen the State places the defendant's future dangerousness at issue and the only available alternative sentence to the death penalty is life imprisonment without parole, due process entitles the defendant to inform the jury he is parole ineligible." 340 S. C., at 297-298, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528. Without considering whether the prosecutor's evidentiary submissions or closing argument in fact placed Shafer's future dangerousness at issue, the court held &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; generally inapplicable to South Carolina's "new sentencing scheme." Under that scheme, life without the possibility of parole and death are not the only authorized sentences, the court said, for there is a third potential sentence, "a mandatory minimum thirty year sentence." 340 S. C., at 298, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528 (citing &lt;i&gt;State&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Starnes,&lt;/i&gt; 340 S. C. 312, 531 S. E. 2d 907 (2000) (decided the same day as &lt;i&gt;Shafer&lt;/i&gt; )).&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*47&lt;/span&gt; Shafer had urged that a &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; instruction was warranted under the new sentencing scheme, for when the jury serves as sentencer, &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; when it finds a statutory aggravating circumstance, sentencing discretion is limited to death or life without the possibility of parole. See 340 S. C., at 298, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528. The South Carolina Supreme Court read &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; differently. In its view, "&lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; requires the trial judge instruct the jury the defendant is parole ineligible only if no other sentence than death, other than life without the possibility of parole, is &lt;i&gt;legally available&lt;/i&gt; to the defendant." 340 S. C., at 298, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528 (emphasis in original) (citing &lt;i&gt;Simmons,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S., at 178 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)). "At the time [Shafer's] jury began its deliberations," the court observed, "three alternative sentences were available"; "[s]ince one of these alternatives to death was not life without the possibility of parole," the court concluded, "&lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; was inapplicable." 340 S. C., at 299, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice Finney dissented. "[T]he overriding principle to be drawn from &lt;i&gt;[Simmons],&lt;/i&gt; " he stated, "is that due process is violated when a jury's speculative misunderstanding about a capital defendant's parole eligibility is allowed to go uncorrected." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 310, 531 S. E. 2d, at 534. Due process mandates reversal here, he concluded, because "the jury's inquiry prompted a misleading response which suggested parole was a possibility." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Moreover, Chief Justice Finney added, when "a capital jury inquires about parole," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 310, n. 2, 531 S. E. 2d, at 534, n. 2, even if the question "is simply one of policy, as the majority suggests [it is], then why not adopt a policy which gives the jurors the simpl[e] truth: no parole." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 311, 531 S. E. 2d, at 534.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*48&lt;/span&gt; We granted certiorari, 530 U. S. 1306 (2000), to determine whether the South Carolina Supreme Court properly held &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; inapplicable to the State's current sentencing regime. We conclude that South Carolina's Supreme Court misinterpreted &lt;i&gt;Simmons,&lt;/i&gt; and we therefore reverse that court's judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Carolina has consistently refused to inform the jury of a capital defendant's parole eligibility status.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; We first confronted this practice in &lt;i&gt;Simmons.&lt;/i&gt; The South Carolina sentencing scheme then in effect, S. C. Code Ann. &#167;&#167; 16-3-20(A) and XX-XX-XXX (Supp. 1993), did not categorically preclude parole for capital defendants sentenced to life imprisonment, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 46-47, n. 3. Simmons, however, was parole ineligible under that scheme because of prior convictions for crimes of violence. See &#167; 24-21-640; &lt;i&gt;Simmons,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S., at 156 (plurality opinion); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 176 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Simmons' jury, in a note to the judge during the penalty phase deliberations, asked: "Does the imposition of a life sentence carry with it the possibility of parole?" &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 160 (plurality opinion). Over defense counsel's objection, the trial judge in &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; instructed: "Do not consider parole or parole eligibility [in reaching your &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*49&lt;/span&gt; verdict]. That is not a proper issue for your consideration." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; After receiving this response from the court, Simmons' jury returned a sentence of death, which Simmons unsuccessfully sought to overturn on appeal to the South Carolina Supreme Court. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 160-161.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindful of the "longstanding practice of parole availability," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 177 (O'Connor, J.), we recognized that Simmons' jury, charged to chose between death and life imprisonment, may have been misled. Given no clear definition of "life imprisonment" and told not to consider parole eligibility, that jury "reasonably may have believed that [Simmons] could be released on parole if he were not executed." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 161 (plurality opinion); see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 177-178 (O'Connor, J.). It did not comport with due process, we held, for the State to "secur[e] a death sentence on the ground, at least in part, of [defendant's] future dangerousness, while at the same time concealing from the sentencing jury the true meaning of its [only] noncapital sentencing alternative, namely, that life imprisonment meant life without parole." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 162 (plurality opinion); see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 178 (O'Connor, J.) ("Where the State puts the defendant's future dangerousness in issue, and the only available alternative sentence to death is life imprisonment without possibility of parole, due process entitles the defendant to inform the capital sentencing jury&#151;by either argument or instruction&#151;that he is parole ineligible.").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As earlier stated, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 46-47, the South Carolina Supreme Court held &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; "inapplicable under the [State's] new sentencing scheme," 340 S. C., at 298, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528. &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; is not triggered, the South Carolina court said, unless life without parole is "the only legally available sentence alternative to death." 340 S. C., at 298, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528. Currently, the court observed, when a capital case jury begins its sentencing deliberations, three alternative sentences are available: "1) death, 2) life without the possibility of parole, or 3) a mandatory minimum thirty year sentence." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; "Since one of these alternatives to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*50&lt;/span&gt; death [is] not life without the possibility of parole," the court concluded, &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; no longer constrains capital sentencing in South Carolina. 340 S. C., at 299, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reasoning might be persuasive if the jury's sentencing discretion encompassed the three choices the South Carolina court identified. But, that is not how the State's new scheme works. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 40-41. Under the law now governing, in any case in which the jury does not unanimously find a statutory aggravator, death is not a permissible sentence and &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; has no relevance. In such a case, the judge alone becomes the sentencer. S. C. Code Ann. &#167; 16-3-20(C) (2000 Cum. Supp.). Only if the jury finds an aggravating circumstance does it decide on the sentence. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; And when it makes that decision, as was the case in &lt;i&gt;Simmons,&lt;/i&gt; only two sentences are legally available under South Carolina law: death or life without the possibility of parole. &#167; 16-3-20(C).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Carolina Supreme Court was no doubt correct to this extent: At the time the trial judge instructed the jury in Shafer's case, it was indeed possible that Shafer would receive a sentence other than death or life without the possibility of parole. That is so because South Carolina, in line with other States, gives capital juries, at the penalty phase, discrete and sequential functions. Initially, capital juries serve as factfinders in determining whether an alleged aggravating circumstance exists. Once that factual threshold is passed, the jurors exercise discretion in determining the punishment that ought to be imposed. The trial judge in Shafer's case recognized the critical difference in the two functions. He charged that "[a] statutory aggravating circumstance is a fact, an incident, a detail or an occurrence," the existence of which must be found beyond a reasonable doubt. App. 203. Turning to the sentencing choice, he referred to considerations of "fairness and mercy," and the defendant's "moral culpability." App. 204. He also instructed &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*51&lt;/span&gt; that the jury was free to decide "whether . . . for any reason or no reason at all Mr. Shafer should be sentenced to life imprisonment rather than to death." App. 203.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, when the jury determines the existence of a statutory aggravator, a tightly circumscribed factual inquiry, none of &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; ` due process concerns arise. There are no "misunderstanding[s]" to avoid, no "false choice[s]" to guard against. See &lt;i&gt;Simmons,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S., at 161 (plurality opinion). The jury, as aggravating circumstance factfinder, exercises no sentencing discretion itself. If no aggravator is found, the judge takes over and has sole authority to impose the mandatory minimum so heavily relied upon by the South Carolina Supreme Court. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 46-47, 49-50. It is only when the jury endeavors the moral judgment whether to impose the death penalty that parole eligibility may become critical. Correspondingly, it is only at that stage that &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; comes into play, a stage at which South Carolina law provides no third choice, no 30-year mandatory minimum, just death or life without parole. See &lt;i&gt;Ramdass,&lt;/i&gt; 530 U. S., at 169 (&lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; applies where "as a legal matter, there is no possibility of parole if the &lt;i&gt;jury&lt;/i&gt; decides the appropriate sentence is life in prison." (emphasis added)).&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; We therefore hold that whenever future dangerousness is at issue in a capital sentencing proceeding under South Carolina's new scheme, due process requires that the jury be informed that a life sentence carries no possibility of parole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*52&lt;/span&gt; III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Carolina offers two other grounds in support of the trial judge's refusal to give Shafer's requested parole ineligibility instruction. First, the State argues that the jury was properly informed of the law on parole ineligibility by the trial court's instructions and by defense counsel's own argument. Second, the State contends that no parole ineligibility instruction was required under &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; because the State never argued Shafer would pose a future danger to society. We now turn to those arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Even if this Court finds &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; was triggered," the State urges, "the defense's closing argument and the judge's charge fulfilled the requirements of &lt;i&gt;Simmons.&lt;/i&gt; " Brief for Respondent 38. To support that contention, the State sets out defense counsel's closing pleas that, if Shafer's life is spared, he will "&lt;i&gt;die in prison&lt;/i&gt; " after "&lt;i&gt;spend[ing] his natural life there.&lt;/i&gt; " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 39. Next, the State recites passages from the trial judge's instructions reiterating that "life imprisonment means until the death of the defendant." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Carolina Supreme Court, we note, never suggested that counsel's arguments or the trial judge's instructions satisfied &lt;i&gt;Simmons.&lt;/i&gt; That court simply held &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt;  inapplicable under the State's new sentencing scheme. 340 S. C., at 298, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528. We do not find the State's position persuasive. Displacement of "the longstanding practice of parole availability" remains a relatively recent development, and "common sense tells us that many jurors might not know whether a life sentence carries with it the possibility of parole." &lt;i&gt;Simmons,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S., at 177-178 (O'Connor, J.). South Carolina's situation is illustrative. Until two years before Shafer's trial, as we earlier noted, the State's law did not categorically preclude parole for capital &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*53&lt;/span&gt; defendants sentenced to life imprisonment. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 46-47, n. 3, and 48.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most plainly contradicting the State's contention, Shafer's jury left no doubt about its failure to gain from defense counsel's closing argument or the judge's instructions any clear understanding of what a life sentence means. The jurors sought further instruction, asking: "Is there any remote chance for someone convicted of murder to become elig[i]ble for parole?" App. 253; cf. &lt;i&gt;Simmons,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S., at 178 (O'Connor, J.) ("that the jury in this case felt compelled to ask whether parole was available shows that the jurors did not know whether or not a life-sentenced defendant will be released from prison").&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury's comprehension was hardly aided by the court's final instruction: "Parole eligibility or ineligibility is not for your consideration." App. 240. That instruction did nothing to ensure that the jury was not misled and may well have been taken to mean "that parole &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; available but that the jury, for some unstated reason, should be blind to this fact." &lt;i&gt;Simmons,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S., at 170 (plurality opinion); see 340 S. C., at 310, 531 S. E. 2d, at 534 (Finney, C. J., dissenting) ("[T]he jury's inquiry prompted a misleading response which suggested parole was a possibility."); &lt;i&gt;State&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kelly,&lt;/i&gt; 343 S. C. 342, 375, 540 S. E. 2d 851, 863-864 (2001) (Pleicones, J., dissenting in part, concurring in part) ("Without the knowledge that, if aggravators are found, a life sentence is not subject to being reduced by parole, or any other method of early release, the jury is likely to speculate unnecessarily on the possibility of early release, and impose a sentence of death &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*54&lt;/span&gt; based upon `fear rather than reason.' " (quoting &lt;i&gt;Yarbrough&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commonwealth,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/va/6r1X/yarbrough-v-com/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;258&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Va.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;347&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 369, 519 S. E. 2d 602, 613 (1999))).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, a life sentence for Shafer would permit no "parole, community supervision, . . . early release program, . . . or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory life imprisonment," S. C. Code Ann. &#167; 16-3-20(A) (2000 Cum. Supp.) (set out &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 42, n. 1); this reality was not conveyed to Shafer's jury by the court's instructions or by the arguments defense counsel was allowed to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the State maintains that "[t]he prosecution did not argue future dangerousness," so the predicate for a &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; charge is not present here. Brief for Respondent 42. That issue is not ripe for our resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the trial court, the prosecutor and defense counsel differed on what it takes to place future dangerousness "at issue." The prosecutor suggested that the State must formally &lt;i&gt;argue&lt;/i&gt; future dangerousness. App. 161. Defense counsel urged that once the prosecutor &lt;i&gt;introduces evidence&lt;/i&gt;  showing future dangerousness, the State cannot avoid a &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; charge by saying the point was not argued or calling the evidence by another name. See App. 161-162.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As earlier recounted, the trial judge determined that future dangerousness was not at issue, but acknowledged, at one point, that the prosecutor had come close to crossing the line. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 41-42, 43. The South Carolina Supreme Court, in order to rule broadly that &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; no longer governs capital sentencing in the State, apparently assumed, &lt;i&gt;arguendo,&lt;/i&gt; that future dangerousness had been shown at Shafer's sentencing proceeding. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 46-47; cf. &lt;i&gt;Kelly,&lt;/i&gt; 343 S. C., at 363, 540 S. E. 2d, at 857 (recognizing that future dangerousness is an issue when it is "a logical inference from the evidence" or was "injected into the case through the State's closing argument"). Because the South &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*55&lt;/span&gt; Carolina Supreme Court did not home in on the question whether the prosecutor's evidentiary submissions or closing argument in fact placed Shafer's future dangerousness at issue, we leave that question open for the state court's attention and disposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the reasons stated, the judgment of the South Carolina Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Scalia, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I concede that today's judgment is a logical extension of &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;South Carolina,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S. 154 (1994), I am more attached to the logic of the Constitution, whose Due Process Clause was understood as an embodiment of common-law tradition, rather than as authority for federal courts to promulgate wise national rules of criminal procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I pointed out in &lt;i&gt;Simmons,&lt;/i&gt; that common-law tradition does not contain special jury-instruction requirements for capital cases. Today's decision is the second page of the "whole new chapter" of our improvised "`death-is-different' jurisprudence" that &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; began. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 185 (Scalia, J., dissenting). The third page (or the fourth or fifth) will be the (logical-enough) extension of this novel requirement to cases in which the jury did &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; inquire into the possibility of parole. Providing such information may well be a good idea (though it will sometimes harm rather than help the defendant's case)&#151;and many States have indeed required it. See App. B to Brief for Petitioner. The Constitution, however, does not. I would limit &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; to its facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Thomas, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For better or, as I believe, worse, the majority's decision in this case is the logical next step after &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;South&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*56&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Carolina,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S. 154 (1994). Now, whenever future dangerousness is placed at issue and the jury's potential sentencing choice is between life without parole and death, the trial court must instruct the jury on the impossibility of release even if there is an alternative sentence available to the court under which the defendant could be released. However, even accepting that sentencing courts in South Carolina must now permit the jury to learn about the impossibility of parole when life imprisonment is a sentencing possibility, I believe that the court's instructions and the arguments made by counsel in Shafer's case were sufficient to inform the jury of what "life imprisonment" meant for Shafer. I therefore respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Simmons,&lt;/i&gt; a majority of this Court was concerned that the jury in Simmons' trial reasonably could have believed that, if he were sentenced to life, he would be eligible for parole. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 161 (plurality opinion); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 177-178 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Therefore, Simmons' defense to future dangerousness&#151;that because he sexually assaulted only elderly women, he would pose no danger to fellow inmates, see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 157 (plurality opinion)&#151;would not have been effective. To correct the jury's possible misunderstanding of the availability of parole, Simmons requested several jury instructions, including one that would explain that, if he were sentenced to life imprisonment, "`he actually w[ould] be sentenced to imprisonment in the state penitentiary for the balance of his natural life.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 160. The trial court rejected this instruction and instead ambiguously informed the jury that the term life imprisonment is to be understood according to its "`plain and ordinary meaning,' " which did "nothing to dispel the misunderstanding reasonable jurors may have about the way in which any particular State defines `life imprisonment.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 169-170.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, by contrast, the judge repeatedly explained that "life imprisonment means until the death of the defendant." App. 201. The judge defined "life imprisonment" as &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*57&lt;/span&gt; "incarceration of the defendant until his death," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 209, and informed the jury that, if it chose the punishment of life imprisonment, the verdict form would read "`We, the jury . . . unanimously recommend that the defendant, Wesley Aaron Shafer, be imprisoned in the state penitentiary for the balance of his natural life.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 213-214. Emphasizing this very point, Shafer's counsel argued to the jury that Shafer would never leave prison if he received a life sentence. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 192 ("The question is will the State execute him or will he just die in prison"); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 194 ("putting a 19 year old in prison until he is dead" and "you can put him some place until he is dead"); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 198 ("When they say give [him] life, he's not going home. . . . I'm just asking for the smallest amount of mercy it takes to make a man, a child spend the rest of his life in prison").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these explanations of what life imprisonment means, which left no room for speculation by the jury, I can only infer that the jury's questions regarding parole referred not to Shafer's parole eligibility in the event the jury sentenced Shafer to life, but rather to his parole eligibility in the event it did not sentence him at all. In fact, both of the jury's questions referred only to parole eligibility of someone "convicted of murder," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 239-240 ("`[I]s there any remote chance that someone convicted of murder could become eligible for parole' "); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 240 ("`[U]nder what conditions would someone convicted for murder be eligible [for parole]' "), rather than parole eligibility of someone &lt;i&gt;sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;/i&gt; Under South Carolina law, if the jury does not find an aggravating circumstance, someone convicted of murder could be sentenced to a term of 30 years' imprisonment or greater. See S. C. Code Ann. &#167; 16-3-20(C) (2000 Cum. Supp.). If the jury thought Shafer's release from prison was a possibility in the event the judge sentenced him, they would have been correct. To be sure, under South Carolina's sentencing scheme, the jury did not need to know what sentencing options were available to the judge in the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*58&lt;/span&gt; event the jury did not find an aggravating circumstance. But that is precisely why the trial court's answers were appropriate. It explained what "life" meant for purposes of the &lt;i&gt;jury&lt;/i&gt; `s sentencing option, and then added that "[p]arole eligibility or ineligibility is not for your consideration." App. 240.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority appears to believe that it could develop jury instructions that are more precise than those offered to Shafer's jury. It may well be right. But it is not this Court's role to micromanage state sentencing proceedings or to develop model jury instructions. I would decline to interfere further with matters that the Constitution leaves to the States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   &lt;i&gt;Sheri Lynn Johnson&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;John H. Blume&lt;/i&gt; filed a brief for the Cornell Death Penalty Project as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Section 16-3-20(A) reads: "A person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to murder must be punished by death, by imprisonment for life, or by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years. If the State seeks the death penalty and a statutory aggravating circumstance is found beyond a reasonable doubt pursuant to subsections (B) and (C), and a recommendation of death is not made, the trial judge must impose a sentence of life imprisonment. For purposes of this section, `life imprisonment' means until death of the offender. No person sentenced to life imprisonment pursuant to this section is eligible for parole, community supervision, or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work credits, education credits, good conduct credits, or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory life imprisonment required by this section. No person sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years pursuant to this section is eligible for parole or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work credits, education credits, good conduct credits, or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years required by this section. . . . When the Governor commutes a sentence of death to life imprisonment under the provisions of Section 14 of Article IV of the Constitution of South Carolina, 1895, the commutee is not eligible for parole, community supervision, or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work credits, good conduct credits, education credits, or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory imprisonment required by this subsection."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The judge also sentenced Shafer to consecutive terms of 20 years in prison for the attempted armed robbery and 5years in prison for the criminal conspiracy. App. 251-252.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  South Carolina's "new" sentencing scheme changed the punishments available for a capital murder conviction that did not result in a death sentence. The capital sentencing law in effect at the time we decided &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; read: "A person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to murder must be punished by death or by imprisonment for life and is not eligible for parole until the service of twenty years; provided, however, that when the State seeks the death penalty and an aggravating circumstance is specifically found beyond a reasonable doubt . . . , and a recommendation of death is not made, the court must impose a sentence of life imprisonment without eligibility for parole until the service of thirty years." S. C. Code Ann. &#167; 16-3-20(A) (Supp. 1993). What made Simmons parole ineligible was the provision stating: "The board must not grant parole nor is parole authorized to any prisoner serving a sentence for a second or subsequent conviction, following a separate sentencing for a prior conviction, for violent crimes . . . ." &#167; 24-21-640. This latter provision has not been amended; however, it did not apply to Shafer. Here, we consider whether South Carolina's wholesale elimination of parole for capital defendants sentenced to life in prison, see S. C. Code Ann. &#167; 16-3-20 (2000 Cum. Supp.), described &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 40-41, requires a &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; instruction in all South Carolina capital cases in which future dangerousness is "at issue."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  At the time we decided &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;South Carolina,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S. 154 (1994), South Carolina was one of only three States&#151;Pennsylvania and Virginia were the others&#151;that "ha[d] a life-without-parole sentencing alternative to capital punishment for some or all convicted murderers but refuse[d] to inform sentencing juries of th[at] fact." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 168, n. 8. Since &lt;i&gt;Simmons,&lt;/i&gt; Virginia has abandoned this practice. &lt;i&gt;Yarbrough&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commonwealth,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/va/6r1X/yarbrough-v-com/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;258&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Va.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;347&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 374, 519 S. E. 2d 602, 616 (1999) ("[W]e hold that in the penalty-determination phase of a trial where the defendant has been convicted of capital murder, in response to a proffer of a proper instruction from the defendant prior to submitting the issue of penaltydetermination to the jury or where the defendant asks for such an instruction following an inquiry from the jury during deliberations, the trial court shall instruct the jury that the words `imprisonment for life' mean `imprisonment for life without possibility of parole.' ").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  Tellingly, the State acknowledged at oral argument that if future dangerousness was a factor, and the jury first reported finding an aggravator before going on to its sentencing recommendation, a &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; charge would at that point be required. Tr. of Oral Arg. 32. We see no significant difference between that situation and the one presented here. Nor does Justice Thomas' dissent in this case plausibly urge any such distinction. See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 56-58. If the jurors should be told life means no parole in the hypothesized bifurcated sentencing proceeding, they should be equally well informed in the actual uninterrupted proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  Animating Justice Thomas' dissent is the conviction that the limited information defense counsel was allowed to convey and the judge's charge "left no room for speculation by the jury." &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 57. The full record scarcely supports, and we do not share, that conviction. Cf. 340 S. C. 291, 310-311, 531 S. E. 2d 524, 534 (2000) (Finney, C. J., dissenting) ("the jury's inquiry prompted a misleading response" that did not reveal the "simpl[e] truth").&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF WASHINGTON
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*143&lt;/span&gt; Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined. Scalia, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Ginsburg, J., joined, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 152. Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens, J., joined, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 153.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*143&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;William J. Kilberg&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Thomas G. Hungar&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Henry Haas.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Barbara McDowell&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal. With her on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Ogden, Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler, Henry L. Solano, Nathaniel I. Spiller,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Elizabeth Hopkins.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thomas C. Goldstein&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Erik S. Jaffe&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Michael W. Jordan.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Thomas, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Washington statute provides that the designation of a spouse as the beneficiary of a nonprobate asset is revoked automatically upon divorce. We are asked to decide whether the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 832, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 1001 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; preempts that statute to the extent it applies to ERISA plans. We hold that it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*144&lt;/span&gt; I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner Donna Rae Egelhoff was married to David A. Egelhoff. Mr. Egelhoff was employed by the Boeing Company, which provided him with a life insurance policy and a pension plan. Both plans were governed by ERISA, and Mr. Egelhoff designated his wife as the beneficiary under both. In April 1994, the Egelhoffs divorced. Just over two months later, Mr. Egelhoff died intestate following an automobile accident. At that time, Mrs. Egelhoff remained the listed beneficiary under both the life insurance policy and the pension plan. The life insurance proceeds, totaling $46,000, were paid to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondents Samantha and David Egelhoff, Mr. Egelhoff's children by a previous marriage, are his statutory heirs under state law. They sued petitioner in Washington state court to recover the life insurance proceeds. Respondents relied on a Washington statute that provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If a marriage is dissolved or invalidated, a provision made prior to that event that relates to the payment or transfer at death of the decedent's interest in a nonprobate asset in favor of or granting an interest or power to the decedent's former spouse is revoked. A provision affected by this section must be interpreted, and the nonprobate asset affected passes, as if the former spouse failed to survive the decedent, having died at the time of entry of the decree of dissolution or declaration of invalidity." Wash. Rev. Code &#167; 11.07.010(2)(a) (1994).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That statute applies to "all nonprobate assets, wherever situated, held at the time of entry by a superior court of this state of a decree of dissolution of marriage or a declaration of invalidity." &#167; 11.07.010(1). It defines "nonprobate asset" to include "a life insurance policy, employee benefit plan, annuity or similar contract, or individual retirement account." &#167; 11.07.010(5)(a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*145&lt;/span&gt; Respondents argued that they were entitled to the life insurance proceeds because the Washington statute disqualified Mrs. Egelhoff as a beneficiary, and in the absence of a qualified named beneficiary, the proceeds would pass to them as Mr. Egelhoff's heirs. In a separate action, respondents also sued to recover the pension plan benefits. Respondents again argued that the Washington statute disqualified Mrs. Egelhoff as a beneficiary and they were thus entitled to the benefits under the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial courts, concluding that both the insurance policy and the pension plan "should be administered in accordance" with ERISA, granted summary judgment to petitioner in both cases. App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a, 48a. The Washington Court of Appeals consolidated the cases and reversed. &lt;i&gt;In re Estate of Egelhoff,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;93&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wash. App.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;314&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 968 P. 2d 924 (1998). It concluded that the Washington statute was not pre-empted by ERISA. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 317, 968 P. 2d, at 925. Applying the statute, it held that respondents were entitled to the proceeds of both the insurance policy and the pension plan. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court of Washington affirmed. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;139&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wash. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;557&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 989 P. 2d 80 (1999). It held that the state statute, although applicable to "employee benefit plan[s]," does not "refe[r] to" ERISA plans to an extent that would require pre-emption, because it "does not apply immediately and exclusively to an ERISA plan, nor is the existence of such a plan essential to operation of the statute." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 574, 989 P. 2d, at 89. It also held that the statute lacks a "connection with" an ERISA plan that would compel pre-emption. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 576, 989 P. 2d, at 90. It emphasized that the statute "does not alter the nature of the plan itself, the administrator's fiduciary duties, or the requirements for plan administration." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 575, 989 P. 2d, at 90. Nor, the court concluded, does the statute conflict with any specific provision of ERISA, including the antialienation provision, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 1056(d)(1), because it "does not operate to divert benefit &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*146&lt;/span&gt; plan proceeds from distribution under terms of the plan documents," but merely alters "the underlying circumstances to which the distribution scheme of [the] plan must be applied." 139 Wash. 2d, at 578, 989 P. 2d, at 91.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courts have disagreed about whether statutes like that of Washington are pre-empted by ERISA. Compare, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Manning&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hayes,&lt;/i&gt; 212 F. 3d 866 (CA5 2000) (finding preemption), cert. pending, No. 00-265,&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hanslip,&lt;/i&gt; 939 F. 2d 904 (CA10 1991) (same), with, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Emard&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hughes Aircraft Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 153 F. 3d 949 (CA9 1998) (finding no pre-emption), and 139 Wash. 2d, at 557, 989 P. 2d, at 80 (same). To resolve the conflict, we granted certiorari. 530 U. S. 1242 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner argues that the Washington statute falls within the terms of ERISA's express pre-emption provision and that it is pre-empted by ERISA under traditional principles of conflict pre-emption. Because we conclude that the statute is expressly pre-empted by ERISA, we address only the first argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ERISA's pre-emption section, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 1144(a), states that ERISA "shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan" covered by ERISA. We have observed repeatedly that this broadly worded provision is "clearly expansive." &lt;i&gt;New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp;amp; Blue Shield&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Plans&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Travelers Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S. 645, 655 (1995); see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Morales&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Trans World Airlines, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 504 U. S. 374, 384 (1992) (listing cases in which we have described ERISA pre-emption in broad terms). But at the same time, we have recognized that the term "relate to" cannot be taken "to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy," or else "for all practical purposes pre-emption would never run its course." &lt;i&gt;Travelers, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 655.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*147&lt;/span&gt; We have held that a state law relates to an ERISA plan "if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan." &lt;i&gt;Shaw&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Delta Air Lines, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S. 85, 97 (1983). Petitioner focuses on the "connection with" part of this inquiry. Acknowledging that "connection with" is scarcely more restrictive than "relate to," we have cautioned against an "uncritical literalism" that would make pre-emption turn on "infinite connections." &lt;i&gt;Travelers, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 656. Instead, "to determine whether a state law has the forbidden connection, we look both to `the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would survive,' as well as to the nature of the effect of the state law on ERISA plans." &lt;i&gt;California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc.,&lt;/i&gt;  519 U. S. 316, 325 (1997), quoting &lt;i&gt;Travelers, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 656 (citation omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying this framework, petitioner argues that the Washington statute has an impermissible connection with ERISA plans. We agree. The statute binds ERISA plan administrators to a particular choice of rules for determining beneficiary status. The administrators must pay benefits to the beneficiaries chosen by state law, rather than to those identified in the plan documents. The statute thus implicates an area of core ERISA concern. In particular, it runs counter to ERISA's commands that a plan shall "specify the basis on which payments are made to and from the plan," &#167; 1102(b)(4), and that the fiduciary shall administer the plan "in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan," &#167; 1104(a)(1)(D), making payments to a "beneficiary" who is "designated by a participant, or by the terms of [the] plan." &#167; 1002(8).&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; In other words, unlike generally applicable &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*148&lt;/span&gt; laws regulating "areas where ERISA has nothing to say," &lt;i&gt;Dillingham,&lt;/i&gt; 519 U. S., at 330, which we have upheld notwithstanding their incidental effect on ERISA plans, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., ibid.,&lt;/i&gt; this statute governs the payment of benefits, a central matter of plan administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington statute also has a prohibited connection with ERISA plans because it interferes with nationally uniform plan administration. One of the principal goals of ERISA is to enable employers "to establish a uniform administrative scheme, which provides a set of standard procedures to guide processing of claims and disbursement of benefits." &lt;i&gt;Fort Halifax Packing Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Coyne,&lt;/i&gt; 482 U. S. 1, 9 (1987). Uniformity is impossible, however, if plans are subject to different legal obligations in different States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington statute at issue here poses precisely that threat. Plan administrators cannot make payments simply by identifying the beneficiary specified by the plan documents.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Instead they must familiarize themselves with &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*149&lt;/span&gt; state statutes so that they can determine whether the named beneficiary's status has been "revoked" by operation of law. And in this context the burden is exacerbated by the choiceof-law problems that may confront an administrator when the employer is located in one State, the plan participant lives in another, and the participant's former spouse lives in a third. In such a situation, administrators might find that plan payments are subject to conflicting legal obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the Washington statute protects administrators from liability for making payments to the named beneficiary unless they have "actual knowledge of the dissolution or other invalidation of marriage," Wash. Rev. Code &#167; 11.07.010(3)(a) (1994), and it permits administrators to refuse to make payments until any dispute among putative beneficiaries is resolved, &#167; 11.07.010(3)(b). But if administrators do pay benefits, they will face the risk that a court might later find that they had "actual knowledge" of a divorce. If they instead decide to await the results of litigation before paying benefits, they will simply transfer to the beneficiaries the costs of delay and uncertainty.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Requiring ERISA administrators to master the relevant laws of 50 States and to contend with litigation would undermine the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*150&lt;/span&gt; congressional goal of "minimiz[ing] the administrative and financial burden[s]" on plan administrators&#151;burdens ultimately borne by the beneficiaries. &lt;i&gt;Ingersoll-Rand Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McClendon,&lt;/i&gt; 498 U. S. 133, 142 (1990).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognize that all state laws create some potential for a lack of uniformity. But differing state regulations affecting an ERISA plan's "system for processing claims and paying benefits" impose "precisely the burden that ERISA preemption was intended to avoid." &lt;i&gt;Fort Halifax, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 10. And as we have noted, the statute at issue here directly conflicts with ERISA's requirements that plans be administered, and benefits be paid, in accordance with plan documents. We conclude that the Washington statute has a "connection with" ERISA plans and is therefore pre-empted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondents suggest several reasons why ordinary ERISA pre-emption analysis should not apply here. First, they observe that the Washington statute allows employers to opt out. According to respondents, the statute neither regulates plan administration nor impairs uniformity because it does not apply when "[t]he instrument governing disposition of the nonprobate asset expressly provides otherwise." Wash. Rev. Code &#167; 11.07.010(2)(b)(i) (1994). We do not believe that the statute is saved from pre-emption simply because it is, at least in a broad sense, a default rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the Washington statute's cancellation of private choice may itself be trumped by specific language in the plan documents, the statute does "dictate the choice[s] facing ERISA plans" with respect to matters of plan administration. &lt;i&gt;Dillingham, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 334. Plan administrators must either follow Washington's beneficiary designation scheme or alter the terms of their plan so as to indicate that they will not follow it. The statute is not any less of a regulation of the terms of ERISA plans simply because there are two ways of complying with it. Of course, simple noncompliance &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*151&lt;/span&gt; with the statute is not one of the options available to plan administrators. Their only choice is one of timing, &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt;  whether to bear the burden of compliance &lt;i&gt;ex post,&lt;/i&gt; by paying benefits as the statute dictates (and in contravention of the plan documents), or &lt;i&gt;ex ante,&lt;/i&gt; by amending the plan.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondents emphasize that the opt-out provision makes compliance with the statute less burdensome than if it were mandatory. That is true enough, but the burden that remains is hardly trivial. It is not enough for plan administrators to opt out of this particular statute. Instead, they must maintain a familiarity with the laws of all 50 States so that they can update their plans as necessary to satisfy the optout requirements of other, similar statutes. They also must be attentive to changes in the interpretations of those statutes by state courts. This "tailoring of plans and employer conduct to the peculiarities of the law of each jurisdiction" is exactly the burden ERISA seeks to eliminate. &lt;i&gt;IngersollRand, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 142.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, respondents emphasize that the Washington statute involves both family law and probate law, areas of traditional state regulation. There is indeed a presumption against pre-emption in areas of traditional state regulation such as family law. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hisquierdo&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hisquierdo,&lt;/i&gt; 439 U. S. 572, 581 (1979). But that presumption can be overcome where, as here, Congress has made clear its desire for pre-emption. Accordingly, we have not hesitated to find state family law pre-empted when it conflicts with ERISA or relates to ERISA plans. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Boggs&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Boggs,&lt;/i&gt; 520 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*152&lt;/span&gt; U. S. 833 (1997) (holding that ERISA pre-empts a state community property law permitting the testamentary transfer of an interest in a spouse's pension plan benefits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, respondents argue that if ERISA pre-empts this statute, then it also must pre-empt the various state statutes providing that a murdering heir is not entitled to receive property as a result of the killing. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Cal. Prob. Code Ann. &#167;&#167; 250-259 (West 1991 and Supp. 2000); 755 Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 755, &#167; 5/2-6 (1999). In the ERISA context, these "slayer" statutes could revoke the beneficiary status of someone who murdered a plan participant. Those statutes are not before us, so we do not decide the issue. We note, however, that the principle underlying the statutes&#151;which have been adopted by nearly every State&#151;is well established in the law and has a long historical pedigree predating ERISA. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Riggs&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Palmer,&lt;/i&gt; 115 N. Y. 506, 22 N. E. 188 (1889). And because the statutes are more or less uniform nationwide, their interference with the aims of ERISA is at least debatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I join the opinion of the Court, since I believe that the "relate to" pre-emptive provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) is assuredly triggered by a state law that contradicts ERISA. As the Court notes, "the statute at issue here directly conflicts with ERISA's requirements that plans be administered, and benefits be paid, in accordance with plan documents." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 150. I remain unsure (as I think the lower courts and everyone else will be) as to what else triggers the "relate to" provision, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*153&lt;/span&gt; which&#151;if it is interpreted to be anything other than a reference to our established jurisprudence concerning conflict and field pre-emption&#151;has no discernible content that would not pick up every ripple in the pond, producing a result "that no sensible person could have intended." &lt;i&gt;California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 519 U. S. 316, 336 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring). I persist in the view that we can bring some coherence to this area, and can give the statute both a plausible and precise content, only by interpreting the "relate to" clause as a reference to our ordinary pre-emption jurisprudence. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens joins, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Justice Scalia, I believe that we should apply normal conflict pre-emption and field pre-emption principles where, as here, a state statute covers ERISA and nonERISA documents alike. &lt;i&gt;Ante&lt;/i&gt; this page (concurring opinion). Our more recent ERISA cases are consistent with this approach. See &lt;i&gt;De Buono&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;NYSA&#151;ILA Medical and Clinical Services Fund,&lt;/i&gt; 520 U. S. 806, 812-813 (1997) (rejecting literal interpretation of ERISA's pre-emption clause); &lt;i&gt;California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 519 U. S. 316, 334 (1997) (narrowly interpreting the clause); &lt;i&gt;New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp;amp; Blue Shield Plans&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Travelers Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S. 645, 656 (1995) ("go[ing] beyond the unhelpful text [of the clause] and the frustrating difficulty of defining its key term, and look[ing] instead to the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide"). See also &lt;i&gt;Boggs&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Boggs,&lt;/i&gt; 520 U. S. 833, 841 (1997) (relying on conflict pre-emption principles instead of ERISA's pre-emption clause). And I fear that our failure to endorse this "new approach" explicitly, &lt;i&gt;Dillingham, supra,&lt;/i&gt;  at 336 (Scalia, J., concurring), will continue to produce an "avalanche of litigation," &lt;i&gt;De Buono, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 809, n. 1, as &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*154&lt;/span&gt; courts struggle to interpret a clause that lacks any "discernible content," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 153 (Scalia, J., concurring), threatening results that Congress could not have intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not agree with Justice Scalia or with the majority, however, that there is any plausible pre-emption principle that leads to a conclusion that ERISA pre-empts the statute at issue here. No one could claim that ERISA pre-empts the entire &lt;i&gt;field&lt;/i&gt; of state law governing inheritance&#151;though such matters "relate to" ERISA broadly speaking. See &lt;i&gt;Travelers, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 655. Neither is there any direct conflict between the Washington statute and ERISA, for the one nowhere directly contradicts the other. Cf. &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 150 (claiming a "direc[t] conflic[t]" between ERISA and the Washington statute). But cf. &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 146 (relying upon the "relate to" language in ERISA's pre-emption clause).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court correctly points out that ERISA requires a fiduciary to make payments to a beneficiary "in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan." 29 U. S. C. &#167; 1104(a)(1)(D). But nothing in the Washington statute requires the contrary. Rather, the state statute simply sets forth a default rule for interpreting documentary silence. The statute specifies that a nonprobate asset will pass at A's death "as if" A's "former spouse" had died first&#151; &lt;i&gt;unless the&lt;/i&gt; "&lt;i&gt;instrument governing disposition of the nonprobate asset expressly provides otherwise.&lt;/i&gt; " Wash. Rev. Code &#167; 11.07.010(2)(b)(i) (1994) (emphasis added). This state-law rule is a rule of interpretation, and it is designed to carry out, not to conflict with, the employee's likely intention as revealed in the plan documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no direct conflict or contradiction between the Washington statute and the terms of the plan documents here at issue. David Egelhoff's investment plan provides that when a "beneficiary designation" is "invalid," the "benefits will be paid" to a "surviving spouse," or "[i]f there is no surviving spouse," to the "children in equal shares." App. 40. The life insurance plan is silent about what occurs when &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*155&lt;/span&gt; a beneficiary designation is invalid. The Washington statute fills in these gaps, &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; matters about which the documents themselves say nothing. Thus, the Washington statute specifies that a beneficiary designation&#151;here "Donna R. Egelhoff wife" in the pension plan&#151;is invalid where there is no longer any such person as Donna R. Egelhoff, wife. See Appendix, &lt;i&gt;infra.&lt;/i&gt; And the statute adds that in such instance the funds would be paid to the children, who themselves are potential pension plan beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court's "direct conflict" conclusion rests upon its claim that "administrators must pay benefits to the beneficiaries chosen by state law, rather than to those identified in the plan documents." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 147. But the Court cannot mean "identified &lt;i&gt;anywhere&lt;/i&gt; in the plan documents," for the Egelhoff children were "identified" as recipients in the pension plan documents should the initial designation to "Donna R. Egelhoff wife" become invalid. And whether that initial designation became invalid upon divorce is a matter about which the plan documents are silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To refer to state law to determine whether a given name makes a designation that is, or has become, invalid makes sense where background property or inheritance law is at issue, say, for example, where a written name is potentially ambiguous, where it is set forth near, but not in, the correct space, where it refers to a missing person perhaps presumed dead, where the name was written at a time the employee was incompetent, or where the name refers to an individual or entity disqualified by other law, say, the rule against perpetuities or rules prohibiting a murderer from benefiting from his crime. Why would Congress want the courts to create an ERISA-related federal property law to deal with such problems? Regardless, to refer to background state law in such circumstances does not &lt;i&gt;directly&lt;/i&gt; conflict with any explicit ERISA provision, for no provision of ERISA forbids reading an instrument or document in light of state property law principles. In any event, in this case the plan documents &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*156&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;explicitly&lt;/i&gt; foresee that a beneficiary designation may become "invalid," but they do not specify the invalidating circumstances. &lt;i&gt;Supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 154-155. To refer to state property law to fill in that blank cannot possibly create any direct conflict with the plan documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority simply denies that there is any blank to fill in and suggests that the plan documents require the plan to pay the designated beneficiary under all circumstances. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 147-148, n. 1. But there is nonetheless an open question, namely, whether a designation that (here explicitly) refers to a wife remains valid after divorce. The question is genuine and important (unlike the imaginary example in the majority's footnote). The plan documents themselves do not answer the question any more than they describe what is to occur in a host of other special circumstances (&lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt;  mental incompetence, intoxication, ambiguous names, etc.). To determine whether ERISA permits state law to answer such questions requires a careful examination of the particular state law in light of ERISA's basic policies. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 147; &lt;i&gt;infra&lt;/i&gt; this page and 157-159. We should not short circuit that necessary inquiry simply by announcing a "direct conflict" where none exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court also complains that the Washington statute restricts the plan's choices to "two." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 150. But it is difficult to take this complaint seriously. After all, the two choices that Washington gives the plan are (1) to comply with Washington's rule or (2) not to comply with Washington's rule. What other choices could there be? A state statute that asks a plan to choose whether it intends to comply is not a statute that directly conflicts with a plan. Quite obviously, it is possible, not "`impossible,' " to comply with both the Washington statute and federal law. &lt;i&gt;Geier&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Honda Motor Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S. 861, 873 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more serious pre-emption question is whether this state statute "`stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.' &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*157&lt;/span&gt; " &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; (quoting &lt;i&gt;Hines&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Davidowitz,&lt;/i&gt; 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941))&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; In answering that question, we must remember that petitioner has to overcome a strong presumption &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; pre-emption. That is because the Washington statute governs family property law&#151;a "fiel[d] of traditional state regulation," where courts will not find federal preemption unless such was the "`clear and manifest purpose of Congress,' " &lt;i&gt;Travelers,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S., at 655 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Rice&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947)), or the state statute does "`major damage' to `clear and substantial' federal interests," &lt;i&gt;Hisquierdo&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hisquierdo,&lt;/i&gt; 439 U. S. 572, 581 (1979) (quoting &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Yazell,&lt;/i&gt; 382 U. S. 341, 352 (1966)). No one can seriously argue that Congress has &lt;i&gt;clearly&lt;/i&gt; resolved the question before us. And the only damage to federal interests that the Court identifies consists of the added administrative burden the state statute imposes upon ERISA plan administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court claims that the Washington statute "interferes with nationally uniform plan administration" by requiring administrators to "familiarize themselves with state statutes." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 148-149. But administrators have to familiarize themselves with state law in any event when they answer such routine legal questions as whether amounts due are subject to garnishment, &lt;i&gt;Mackey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lanier Collection Agency &amp;amp; Service, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 486 U. S. 825, 838 (1988), who is a "spouse," who qualifies as a "child," or when an employee is legally dead. And were that "familiarizing burden" somehow overwhelming, the plan could easily avoid it by resolving the divorce revocation issue in the plan documents themselves, stating expressly that state law does not apply. The "burden" thus reduces to a one-time requirement that would fall primarily upon the few who draft model ERISA documents, not upon the many who administer them. So meager a burden cannot justify pre-empting a state law that enjoys a presumption against pre-emption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*158&lt;/span&gt; The Court also fears that administrators would have to make difficult choice-of-law determinations when parties live in different States. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 148-149. Whether this problem is or is not "major" in practice, the Washington statute resolves it by expressly setting forth procedures whereby the parties or the courts, &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the plan administrator, are responsible for resolving it. See &#167;&#167; 11.07.010(3)(b)(i)&#151;(ii) (stating that a plan may "without liability, refuse to pay or transfer a nonprobate asset" until "[a]ll beneficiaries and other interested persons claiming an interest have consented in writing to the payment or transfer" or "[t]he payment or transfer is authorized or directed by a court of proper jurisdiction"); &#167; 11.07.010(3)(c) (plan may condition payment on provision of security by recipient to indemnify plan for costs); &#167; 11.07.010(2)(b)(i) (plan may avoid default rule by expressing its intent in the plan documents).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court has previously made clear that the fact that state law "impose[s] some burde[n] on the administration of ERISA plans" does not necessarily require pre-emption. &lt;i&gt;De Buono,&lt;/i&gt; 520 U. S., at 815; &lt;i&gt;Mackey, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 831 (upholding state garnishment law notwithstanding claim that "benefit plans subjected to garnishment will incur substantial administrative burdens"). Precisely, what is it about this statute's requirement that distinguishes it from the "`myriad state laws' " that impose some kind of burden on ERISA plans? &lt;i&gt;De Buono, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 815 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Travelers, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 668).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if one looks beyond administrative burden, one finds that Washington's statute poses no obstacle, but furthers ERISA's ultimate objective&#151;developing a fair system for protecting employee benefits. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;R. A. Gray &amp;amp; Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 717, 720 (1984). The Washington statute transfers an employee's pension assets at death to those individuals whom the worker would likely have wanted to receive them. As many jurisdictions have concluded, divorced workers more often prefer that a child, rather than a divorced spouse, receive &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*159&lt;/span&gt; those assets. Of course, an employee can secure this result by changing a beneficiary form; but doing so requires awareness, understanding, and time. That is why Washington and many other jurisdictions have created a statutory assumption that divorce works a revocation of a designation in favor of an ex-spouse. That assumption is embodied in the Uniform Probate Code; it is consistent with human experience; and those with expertise in the matter have concluded that it "more often" serves the cause of "[j]ustice." Langbein, The Nonprobate Revolution and the Future of the Law of Succession, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 1108, 1135 (1984).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In forbidding Washington to apply that assumption here, the Court permits a divorced wife, who &lt;i&gt;already&lt;/i&gt; acquired, during the divorce proceeding, her fair share of the couple's community property, to receive in addition the benefits that the divorce court awarded to her former husband. To be more specific, Donna Egelhoff already received a business, an IRA account, and stock; David received, among other things, 100% of his pension benefits. App. 31-34. David did not change the beneficiary designation in the pension plan or life insurance plan during the 6-month period between his divorce and his death. As a result, Donna will now receive a windfall of approximately $80,000 at the expense of David's children. The State of Washington enacted a statute to prevent precisely this kind of unfair result. But the Court, relying on an inconsequential administrative burden, concludes that Congress required it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the logic of the Court's decision does not stop at divorce revocation laws. The Washington statute is virtually indistinguishable from other traditional state-law rules, for example, rules using presumptions to transfer assets in the case of simultaneous deaths, and rules that prohibit a husband who kills a wife from receiving benefits as a result of the wrongful death. It is particularly difficult to believe that Congress wanted to pre-empt the latter kind of statute. But how do these statutes differ from the one before us? &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*160&lt;/span&gt; Slayer statutes&#151;like this statute&#151;"gover[n] the payment of benefits, a central matter of plan administration." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 148. And contrary to the Court's suggestion, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 152, slayer statutes vary from State to State in their details just like divorce revocation statutes. Compare Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &#167; 14-2803(F) (1995) (requiring proof, in a civil proceeding, under preponderance of the evidence standard); Haw. Rev. Stat. &#167; 560:2-803(g) (1999) (same), with Ga. Code Ann. &#167; 53-1&#151;5(d) (Supp. 1996) (requiring proof under clear and convincing evidence standard); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18&#151;A, &#167; 2-803(e) (1998) (same); and Ala. Code &#167; 43-8&#151;253(e) (1991) (treating judgment of conviction as conclusive when it becomes final); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18&#151;A, &#167; 2-803(e) (1998) (same), with Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &#167; 14-2803(F) (1995) (treating judgment of conviction as conclusive only after "all right to appeal has been exhausted"); Haw. Rev. Stat. &#167; 560:2&#151; 803(g) (1999) (same). Indeed, the "slayer" conflict would seem more serious, not less serious, than the conflict before us, for few, if any, slayer statutes permit plans to opt out of the state property law rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"ERISA pre-emption analysis," the Court has said, must "respect" the "separate spher[e]" of state "authority." &lt;i&gt;Fort Halifax Packing Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Coyne,&lt;/i&gt; 482 U. S. 1, 19 (1987) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Alessi&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 451 U. S. 504, 522 (1981)) (internal quotation marks omitted). In so stating, the Court has recognized the practical importance of preserving local independence, at retail, &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; by applying pre-emption analysis with care, statute by statute, line by line, in order to determine how best to reconcile a federal statute's language and purpose with federalism's need to preserve state autonomy. Indeed, in today's world, filled with legal complexity, the true test of federalist principle may lie, not in the occasional constitutional effort to trim Congress' commerce power at its edges, &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Morrison,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S. 598 (2000), or to protect a State's treasury from a private damages action, &lt;i&gt;Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*161&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Garrett,&lt;/i&gt; 531 U. S. 356 (2001), but rather in those many statutory cases where courts interpret the mass of technical detail that is the ordinary diet of the law, &lt;i&gt;AT&amp;amp;T Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Iowa Utilities Bd.,&lt;/i&gt; 525 U. S. 366, 427 (1999) (Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, "field pre-emption" is not at issue. There is no "direct" conflict between state and federal statutes. The state statute poses no significant obstacle to the accomplishment of any federal objective. Any effort to squeeze some additional pre-emptive force from ERISA's words (&lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; "relate to") is inconsistent with the Court's recent case law. And the state statute before us is one regarding family property&#151;a "fiel[d] of traditional state regulation," where the interpretive presumption against pre-emption is particularly strong. &lt;i&gt;Travelers,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S., at 655. For these reasons, I disagree with the Court's conclusion. And, consequently, I dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APPENDIX TO OPINION OF BREYER, J.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Briefs of &lt;i&gt;amici curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging affirmance were filed for the State of Washington et al. by &lt;i&gt;Christine O. Gregoire,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General of Washington, &lt;i&gt;Jay D. Geck,&lt;/i&gt; Assistant Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;William Berggren Collins,&lt;/i&gt; Senior Assistant Attorney General, and by the Attorneys General for their respective States as follows: &lt;i&gt;Mark Pryor&lt;/i&gt; of Arkansas, &lt;i&gt;Ken Salazar&lt;/i&gt;  of Colorado, &lt;i&gt;Thomas F. Reilly&lt;/i&gt; of Massachusetts, &lt;i&gt;Joseph P. Mazurek&lt;/i&gt; of Montana, &lt;i&gt;W. A. Drew Edmondson&lt;/i&gt; of Oklahoma, &lt;i&gt;Jan Graham&lt;/i&gt; of Utah, &lt;i&gt;William H. Sorrell&lt;/i&gt; of Vermont, and &lt;i&gt;Darrell V. McGraw, Jr.,&lt;/i&gt; of West Virginia; and for the National Conference of State Legislatures et al. by &lt;i&gt;Richard Ruda&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;James I. Crowley.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   [Reporter's Note: See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 941.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  One can of course escape the conflict between the plan documents (which require making payments to the named beneficiary) and the statute (which requires making payments to someone else) by calling the statute an "invalidation" of the designation of the named beneficiary, and by observing that the plan documents are silent on whether "invalidation" is to occur upon divorce. The dissent employs just such an approach. See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 155-156 (opinion of Breyer, J.). Reading a clear statement as an ambiguous metastatement enables one to avoid all kinds of conflicts between seemingly contradictory texts. Suppose, for example, that the statute required that all pension benefits be paid to the Governor of Washington. That seems inconsistent with the plan documents (and with ERISA), but the inconsistency disappears if one calls the statute an "invalidation" of the principal and alternate beneficiary designations. After all, neither the plan nor ERISA actually &lt;i&gt;says&lt;/i&gt; that beneficiaries &lt;i&gt;cannot&lt;/i&gt; be invalidated in favor of the Governor. This approach exploits the logical inability of any text to contain a complete set of instructions for its own interpretation. It has the vice&#151;or perhaps the virtue, depending upon one's point of view&#151;of draining all language of its meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Respondents argue that in this case, the disposition dictated by the Washington statute is consistent with that specified in the plan documents. Because Mr. Egelhoff designated "Donna R. Egelhoff wife" as the beneficiary of the life insurance policy, they contend that once the Egelhoffs divorced, "there was no such person as `Donna R. Egelhoff &lt;i&gt;wife';&lt;/i&gt; the designated person had definitionally ceased to exist." Brief for Respondents 44 (emphasis in original); see also &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 155 (Breyer, J., dissenting). In effect, respondents ask us to infer that what Mr. Egelhoff meant when he filled out the form was not "Donna R. Egelhoff, who is my wife," but rather "a new legal person&#151;'Donna as spouse,' " Brief for Respondents 44. They do not mention, however, that below the "Beneficiary" line on the form, the printed text reads, "First Name [space] Middle Initial [space] Last Name [space] Relationship." See Appendix to opinion of Breyer, J., &lt;i&gt;post.&lt;/i&gt; Rather than impute to Mr. Egelhoff the unnatural (and indeed absurd) literalism suggested by respondents, we conclude that he simply provided all of the information requested by the form. The happenstance that "Relationship" was on the same line as the beneficiary's name does not, we think, evince an intent to designate "a new legal person."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  The dissent observes that the Washington statute permits a plan administrator to avoid resolving the dispute himself and to let courts or parties settle the matter. See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 158. This observation only presents an example of how the costs of delay and uncertainty can be passed on to beneficiaries, thereby thwarting ERISA's objective of efficient plan administration. Cf&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Halifax Packing Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Coyne,&lt;/i&gt; 482 U. S. 1, 9 (1987).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Contrary to the dissent's suggestion that the resolution of this case depends on one's view of federalism, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 160-161, we are called upon merely to interpret ERISA. And under the text of ERISA, the fiduciary "shall" administer the plan "in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan," 29 U. S. C. &#167; 1104(a)(1)(D). The Washington statute conflicts with this command because under this statute, the only way the fiduciary can administer the plan according to its terms is to change the very terms he is supposed to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF TEXAS

Kennedy, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Scalia and Thomas, JJ., joined, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 174. Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 177.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gregory S. Coleman,&lt;/i&gt; Solicitor General of Texas, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;John Cornyn,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, &lt;i&gt;Andy Taylor,&lt;/i&gt; First Assistant Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;S. Kyle Duncan,&lt;/i&gt; Assistant Solicitor General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lisa Schiavo Blatt&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal. With her on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney Gen-&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*164&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;eral Robinson, Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Deborah Watson.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Roy E. Greenwood,&lt;/i&gt; by appointment of the Court, 531 U. S. 807, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;David A. Schulman&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lee Haidusek.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that a criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches not only to the offense with which he is charged, but to other offenses "closely related factually" to the charged offense. We hold that our decision in &lt;i&gt;McNeil&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin,&lt;/i&gt; 501 U. S. 171 (1991), meant what it said, and that the Sixth Amendment right is "offense specific."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 1993, Lindsey Owings reported to the Walker County, Texas, Sheriff's Office that the home he &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*165&lt;/span&gt; shared with his wife, Margaret, and their 16-month-old daughter, Kori Rae, had been burglarized. He also informed police that his wife and daughter were missing. Respondent Raymond Levi Cobb lived across the street from the Owings. Acting on an anonymous tip that respondent was involved in the burglary, Walker County investigators questioned him about the events. He denied involvement. In July 1994, while under arrest for an unrelated offense, respondent was again questioned about the incident. Respondent then gave a written statement confessing to the burglary, but he denied knowledge relating to the disappearances. Respondent was subsequently indicted for the burglary, and Hal Ridley was appointed in August 1994 to represent respondent on that charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Ridley's appointment, investigators asked and received his permission to question respondent about the disappearances. Respondent continued to deny involvement. Investigators repeated this process in September 1995, again with Ridley's permission and again with the same result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 1995, respondent, free on bond in the burglary case, was living with his father in Odessa, Texas. At that time, respondent's father contacted the Walker County Sheriff's Office to report that respondent had confessed to him that he killed Margaret Owings in the course of the burglary. Walker County investigators directed respondent's father to the Odessa police station, where he gave a statement. Odessa police then faxed the statement to Walker County, where investigators secured a warrant for respondent's arrest and faxed it back to Odessa. Shortly thereafter, Odessa police took respondent into custody and administered warnings pursuant to &lt;i&gt;Miranda&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arizona,&lt;/i&gt; 384 U. S. 436 (1966). Respondent waived these rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short time, respondent confessed to murdering both Margaret and Kori Rae. Respondent explained that when Margaret confronted him as he was attempting to remove &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*166&lt;/span&gt; the Owings' stereo, he stabbed her in the stomach with a knife he was carrying. Respondent told police that he dragged her body to a wooded area a few hundred yards from the house. Respondent then stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"`I went back to her house and I saw the baby laying on its bed. I took the baby out there and it was sleeping the whole time. I laid the baby down on the ground four or five feet away from its mother. I went back to my house and got a flat edge shovel. That's all I could find. Then I went back over to where they were and I started digging a hole between them. After I got the hole dug, the baby was awake. It started going toward its mom and it fell in the hole. I put the lady in the hole and I covered them up. I remember stabbing a different knife I had in the ground where they were. I was crying right then.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. A-9 to A-10.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent later led police to the location where he had buried the victims' bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent was convicted of capital murder for murdering more than one person in the course of a single criminal transaction. See Tex. Penal Code Ann. &#167; 19.03(a)(7)(A) (1994). He was sentenced to death. On appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, respondent argued, &lt;i&gt;inter alia,&lt;/i&gt; that his confession should have been suppressed because it was obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Relying on &lt;i&gt;Michigan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jackson,&lt;/i&gt;  475 U. S. 625 (1986), respondent contended that his right to counsel had attached when Ridley was appointed in the burglary case and that Odessa police were therefore required to secure Ridley's permission before proceeding with the interrogation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Criminal Appeals reversed respondent's conviction by a divided vote and remanded for a new trial. The court held that "once the right to counsel attaches to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*167&lt;/span&gt; the offense charged, it also attaches to any other offense that is very closely related factually to the offense charged." &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;2000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;WL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;275644&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, *3 (2000) (citations omitted). Finding the capital murder charge to be "factually interwoven with the burglary," the court concluded that respondent's Sixth Amendment right to counsel had attached on the capital murder charge even though respondent had not yet been charged with that offense. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at *4. The court further found that respondent had asserted that right by accepting Ridley's appointment in the burglary case. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Accordingly, it deemed the confession inadmissible and found that its introduction had not been harmless error. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at *4&#151;*5. Three judges dissented, finding &lt;i&gt;Michigan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jackson&lt;/i&gt; to be distinguishable and concluding that respondent had made a valid unilateral waiver of his right to counsel before confessing. See 2000 WL, at *5&#151;*13 (opinion of McCormick, P. J.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State sought review in this Court, and we granted certiorari to consider first whether the Sixth Amendment right to counsel extends to crimes that are "factually related" to those that have actually been charged, and second whether respondent made a valid unilateral waiver of that right in this case. 530 U. S. 1260 (2000). Because we answer the first question in the negative, we do not reach the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sixth Amendment provides that "[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence." In &lt;i&gt;McNeil&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin,&lt;/i&gt; 501 U. S. 171 (1991), we explained when this right arises:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Sixth Amendment right [to counsel] . . . is offense specific. It cannot be invoked once for all future prosecutions, for it does not attach until a prosecution is commenced, that is, at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings&#151;whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*168&lt;/span&gt; or arraignment." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 175 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, we held that a defendant's statements regarding offenses for which he had not been charged were admissible notwithstanding the attachment of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel on other charged offenses. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 176.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some state courts and Federal Courts of Appeals, however, have read into &lt;i&gt;McNeil&lt;/i&gt; `s offense-specific definition an exception for crimes that are "factually related" to a charged offense.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Several of these courts have interpreted &lt;i&gt;Brewer&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Williams,&lt;/i&gt; 430 U. S. 387 (1977), and &lt;i&gt;Maine&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Moulton,&lt;/i&gt;  474 U. S. 159 (1985)&#151;both of which were decided well before &lt;i&gt;McNeil&lt;/i&gt; &#151;to support this view, which respondent now invites us to approve. We decline to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Brewer,&lt;/i&gt; a suspect in the abduction and murder of a 10-year-old girl had fled from the scene of the crime in Des Moines, Iowa, some 160 miles east to Davenport, Iowa, where he surrendered to police. An arrest warrant was issued in Des Moines on a charge of abduction, and the suspect was arraigned on that warrant before a Davenport judge. Des Moines police traveled to Davenport, took the man into custody, and began the drive back to Des Moines. Along the way, one of the officers persuaded the suspect to lead police to the victim's body. The suspect ultimately was convicted of the girl's murder. This Court upheld the federal habeas court's conclusion that police had violated the suspect's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. We held that the officer's comments to the suspect constituted interrogation &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*169&lt;/span&gt; and that the suspect had not validly waived his right to counsel by responding to the officer. See 430 U. S., at 405-406.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent suggests that &lt;i&gt;Brewer&lt;/i&gt; implicitly held that the right to counsel attached to the factually related murder when the suspect was arraigned on the abduction charge. See Brief for Respondent 4. The Court's opinion, however, simply did not address the significance of the fact that the suspect had been arraigned only on the abduction charge, nor did the parties in any way argue this question. Constitutional rights are not defined by inferences from opinions which did not address the question at issue. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Hagans&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Lavine,&lt;/i&gt; 415 U. S. 528, 535, n. 5 (1974) ("[W]hen questions of jurisdiction have been passed on in prior decisions &lt;i&gt;sub silentio,&lt;/i&gt; this Court has never considered itself bound when a subsequent case finally brings the jurisdictional issue before us").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Moulton&lt;/i&gt; is similarly unhelpful to respondent. That case involved two individuals indicted for a series of thefts, one of whom had secretly agreed to cooperate with the police investigation of his codefendant, Moulton. At the suggestion of police, the informant recorded several telephone calls and one face-to-face conversation he had with Moulton during which the two discussed their criminal exploits and possible alibis. In the course of those conversations, Moulton made various incriminating statements regarding both the thefts for which he had been charged and additional crimes. In a superseding indictment, Moulton was charged with the original crimes as well as burglary, arson, and three additional thefts. At trial, the State introduced portions of the recorded face-to-face conversation, and Moulton ultimately was convicted of three of the originally charged thefts plus one count of burglary. Moulton appealed his convictions to the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine, arguing that introduction of the recorded conversation violated &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*170&lt;/span&gt; his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. That court agreed, holding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"`Those statements may be admissible in the investigation or prosecution of charges for which, at the time the recordings were made, adversary proceedings had not yet commenced. But as to the charges for which Moulton's right to counsel had already attached, his incriminating statements should have been ruled inadmissible at trial, given the circumstances in which they were acquired.' " 474 U. S., at 168 (quoting &lt;i&gt;State&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Moulton,&lt;/i&gt;  481 A. 2d 155, 161 (1984)).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent contends that, in affirming reversal of both the theft and burglary charges, the &lt;i&gt;Moulton&lt;/i&gt; Court must have concluded that Moulton's Sixth Amendment right to counsel attached to the burglary charge. See Brief for Respondent 13-14; see also Brief for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as &lt;i&gt;Amici Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 22-23. But the &lt;i&gt;Moulton&lt;/i&gt; Court did not address the question now before us, and to the extent &lt;i&gt;Moulton&lt;/i&gt; spoke to the matter at all, it expressly referred to the offense-specific nature of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The police have an interest in the thorough investigation of crimes for which &lt;i&gt;formal charges&lt;/i&gt; have already been filed. They also have an interest in investigating new or additional crimes. Investigations of either type of crime may require surveillance of individuals already under indictment. Moreover, law enforcement officials investigating an individual suspected of committing one crime and &lt;i&gt;formally charged&lt;/i&gt; with having committed another crime obviously seek to discover evidence useful at a trial of either crime. In seeking evidence pertaining to &lt;i&gt;pending charges,&lt;/i&gt; however, the Government's investigative powers are limited by the Sixth Amendment rights of the accused. . . . On the other hand, to exclude &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*171&lt;/span&gt; evidence pertaining to charges as to which the Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not attached at the time the evidence was obtained, simply because other charges were pending at that time, would unnecessarily frustrate the public's interest in the investigation of criminal activities." 474 U. S., at 179-180 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 168 ("[T]he purpose of their meeting was to discuss the &lt;i&gt;pending charges&lt;/i&gt; "); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 177 ("[T]he police knew . . . that Moulton and [the informant] were meeting for the express purpose of discussing the &lt;i&gt;pending charges&lt;/i&gt; . . ." (emphasis added)). Thus, respondent's reliance on &lt;i&gt;Moulton&lt;/i&gt;  is misplaced and, in light of the language employed there and subsequently in &lt;i&gt;McNeil,&lt;/i&gt; puzzling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent predicts that the offense-specific rule will prove "disastrous" to suspects' constitutional rights and will "permit law enforcement officers almost complete and total license to conduct unwanted and uncounseled interrogations." Brief for Respondent 8-9. Besides offering no evidence that such a parade of horribles has occurred in those jurisdictions that have not enlarged upon &lt;i&gt;McNeil,&lt;/i&gt; he fails to appreciate the significance of two critical considerations. First, there can be no doubt that a suspect must be apprised of his rights against compulsory self-incrimination and to consult with an attorney before authorities may conduct custodial interrogation. See &lt;i&gt;Miranda&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arizona,&lt;/i&gt; 384 U. S., at 479; &lt;i&gt;Dickerson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 530 U. S. 428, 435 (2000) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Miranda&lt;/i&gt; ). In the present case, police scrupulously followed &lt;i&gt;Miranda&lt;/i&gt; `s dictates when questioning respondent.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Second, it is critical to recognize that the Constitution &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*172&lt;/span&gt; does not negate society's interest in the ability of police to talk to witnesses and suspects, even those who have been charged with other offenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Since the ready ability to obtain uncoerced confessions is not an evil but an unmitigated good, society would be the loser. Admissions of guilt resulting from valid &lt;i&gt;Miranda&lt;/i&gt; waivers `are more than merely "desirable"; they are essential to society's compelling interest in finding, convicting, and punishing those who violate the law.' " &lt;i&gt;McNeil,&lt;/i&gt; 501 U. S., at 181 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Moran&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bur-&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;bine,&lt;/i&gt; 475 U. S. 412, 426 (1986)).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;i&gt;Moulton, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 180 ("[T]o exclude evidence pertaining to charges as to which the Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not attached at the time the evidence was obtained, simply because other charges were pending at that time, would unnecessarily frustrate the public's interest in the investigation of criminal activities").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it is clear that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches only to charged offenses, we have recognized &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*173&lt;/span&gt; in other contexts that the definition of an "offense" is not necessarily limited to the four corners of a charging instrument. In &lt;i&gt;Blockburger&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 284 U. S. 299 (1932), we explained that "where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 304. We have since applied the &lt;i&gt;Blockburger&lt;/i&gt; test to delineate the scope of the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause, which prevents multiple or successive prosecutions for the "same offence." See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Brown&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ohio,&lt;/i&gt; 432 U. S. 161, 164-166 (1977). We see no constitutional difference between the meaning of the term "offense" in the contexts of double jeopardy and of the right to counsel. Accordingly, we hold that when the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches, it does encompass offenses that, even if not formally charged, would be considered the same offense under the &lt;i&gt;Blockburger&lt;/i&gt; test.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While simultaneously conceding that its own test "lacks the precision for which police officers may hope," &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 186, the dissent suggests that adopting &lt;i&gt;Blockburger&lt;/i&gt; `s definition of "offense" will prove difficult to administer. But it is the dissent's vague iterations of the "`closely related to' " or "`inextricably intertwined with' " test, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 186, that would defy simple application. The dissent seems to presuppose that officers will possess complete knowledge of the circumstances surrounding an incident, such that the officers will be able to tailor their investigation to avoid addressing factually related offenses. Such an assumption, however, ignores the reality that police often are not yet aware of the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*174&lt;/span&gt; exact sequence and scope of events they are investigating&#151; indeed, that is why police must investigate in the first place. Deterred by the possibility of violating the Sixth Amendment, police likely would refrain from questioning certain defendants altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains only to apply these principles to the facts at hand. At the time he confessed to Odessa police, respondent had been indicted for burglary of the Owings residence, but he had not been charged in the murders of Margaret and Kori Rae. As defined by Texas law, burglary and capital murder are not the same offense under &lt;i&gt;Blockburger.&lt;/i&gt; Compare Tex. Penal Code Ann. &#167; 30.02(a) (1994) (requiring entry into or continued concealment in a habitation or building) with &#167; 19.03(a)(7)(A) (requiring murder of more than one person during a single criminal transaction). Accordingly, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel did not bar police from interrogating respondent regarding the murders, and respondent's confession was therefore admissible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas is reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas join, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court's opinion is altogether sufficient to explain why the decision of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals should be reversed for failure to recognize the offense-specific nature of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. It seems advisable, however, to observe that the Court has reached its conclusion without the necessity to reaffirm or give approval to the decision in &lt;i&gt;Michigan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jackson,&lt;/i&gt; 475 U. S. 625 (1986). This course is wise, in my view, for the underlying theory of &lt;i&gt;Jackson&lt;/i&gt; seems questionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the facts of the instant case well illustrate, it isdifficult to understand the utility of a Sixth Amendment rule that operates to invalidate a confession given by the free &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*175&lt;/span&gt; choice of suspects who have received proper advice of their &lt;i&gt;Miranda&lt;/i&gt; rights but waived them nonetheless. See &lt;i&gt;Miranda&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arizona,&lt;/i&gt; 384 U. S. 436 (1966). The &lt;i&gt;Miranda&lt;/i&gt; rule, and the related preventative rule of &lt;i&gt;Edwards&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arizona,&lt;/i&gt;  451 U. S. 477 (1981), serve to protect a suspect's voluntary choice not to speak outside his lawyer's presence. The parallel rule announced in &lt;i&gt;Jackson,&lt;/i&gt; however, supersedes the suspect's voluntary choice to speak with investigators. After &lt;i&gt;Jackson&lt;/i&gt; had been decided, the Court made the following observation with respect to &lt;i&gt;Edwards:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Preserving the integrity of an accused's choice to communicate with police only through counsel is the essence of &lt;i&gt;Edwards&lt;/i&gt; and its progeny&#151;not barring an accused from making an &lt;i&gt;initial&lt;/i&gt; election as to whether he will face the State's officers during questioning with the aid of counsel, or go it alone. If an accused `knowingly and intelligently' pursues the latter course, we see no reason why the uncounseled statements he then makes must be excluded at his trial." &lt;i&gt;Patterson&lt;/i&gt; v.&lt;i&gt;Illinois,&lt;/i&gt;  487 U. S. 285, 291 (1988).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is little justification for not applying the same course of reasoning with equal force to the court-made preventative rule announced in &lt;i&gt;Jackson;&lt;/i&gt; for &lt;i&gt;Jackson,&lt;/i&gt; after all, was a wholesale importation of the &lt;i&gt;Edwards&lt;/i&gt; rule into the Sixth Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the instant case, Cobb at no time indicated to law enforcement authorities that he elected to remain silent about the double murder. By all indications, he made the voluntary choice to give his own account. Indeed, even now Cobb does not assert that he had no wish to speak at the time he confessed. While the &lt;i&gt;Edwards&lt;/i&gt; rule operates to preserve the free choice of a suspect to remain silent, if &lt;i&gt;Jackson&lt;/i&gt; were to apply it would override that choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is further reason to doubt the wisdom of the &lt;i&gt;Jackson&lt;/i&gt; holding. Neither &lt;i&gt;Miranda&lt;/i&gt; nor &lt;i&gt;Edwards&lt;/i&gt; enforces the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*176&lt;/span&gt; Fifth Amendment right unless the suspect makes a clear and unambiguous assertion of the right to the presence of counsel during custodial interrogation. &lt;i&gt;Davis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt;  512 U. S. 452, 459 (1994). Where a required &lt;i&gt;Miranda&lt;/i&gt; warning has been given, a suspect's later confession, made outside counsel's presence, is suppressed to protect the Fifth Amendment right of silence only if a reasonable officer should have been certain that the suspect expressed the unequivocal election of the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches quite without reference to the suspect's choice to speak with investigators after a &lt;i&gt;Miranda&lt;/i&gt; warning. It is the commencement of a formal prosecution, indicated by the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings, that marks the beginning of the Sixth Amendment right. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 167-168 (quoting &lt;i&gt;McNeil&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin,&lt;/i&gt; 501 U. S. 171, 175 (1991)). These events may be quite independent of the suspect's election to remain silent, the interest which the &lt;i&gt;Edwards&lt;/i&gt; rule serves to protect with respect to &lt;i&gt;Miranda&lt;/i&gt; and the Fifth Amendment, and it thus makes little sense for a protective rule to attach absent such an election by the suspect. We ought to question the wisdom of a judge-made preventative rule to protect a suspect's desire not to speak when it cannot be shown that he had that intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if &lt;i&gt;Jackson&lt;/i&gt; is to remain good law, its protections should apply only where a suspect has made a clear and unambiguous assertion of the right not to speak outside the presence of counsel, the same clear election required under &lt;i&gt;Edwards.&lt;/i&gt; Cobb made no such assertion here, yet Justice Breyer's dissent rests upon the assumption that the &lt;i&gt;Jackson&lt;/i&gt; rule should operate to exclude the confession no matter. There would be little justification for this extension of a rule that, even in a more limited application, rests on a doubtful rationale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Breyer defends &lt;i&gt;Jackson&lt;/i&gt; by arguing that, once a suspect has accepted counsel at the commencement of adversarial &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*177&lt;/span&gt; proceedings, he should not be forced to confront the police during interrogation without the assistance of counsel. See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 179-181. But the acceptance of counsel at an arraignment or similar proceeding only begs the question: acceptance of counsel for what? It is quite unremarkable that a suspect might want the assistance of an expert in the law to guide him through hearings and trial, and the attendant complex legal matters that might arise, but nonetheless might choose to give on his own a forthright account of the events that occurred. A court-made rule that prevents a suspect from even making this choice serves little purpose, especially given the regime of &lt;i&gt;Miranda&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Edwards.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these further remarks, I join in full the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case focuses upon the meaning of a single word, "offense," when it arises in the context of the Sixth Amendment. Several basic background principles define that context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel plays a central role in ensuring the fairness of criminal proceedings in our system of justice. See &lt;i&gt;Gideon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wainwright,&lt;/i&gt; 372 U. S. 335, 344 (1963); &lt;i&gt;Powell&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Alabama,&lt;/i&gt; 287 U. S. 45, 57 (1932).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the right attaches when adversary proceedings, triggered by the government's formal accusation of a crime, begin. See &lt;i&gt;Brewer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Williams,&lt;/i&gt; 430 U. S. 387, 401 (1977); &lt;i&gt;Kirby&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Illinois,&lt;/i&gt; 406 U. S. 682, 689 (1972); &lt;i&gt;Massiah&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 377 U. S. 201, 206 (1964).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, once this right attaches, law enforcement officials are required, in most circumstances, to deal with the defendant through counsel rather than directly, even if the defendant has waived his Fifth Amendment rights. See &lt;i&gt;Michigan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jackson,&lt;/i&gt; 475 U. S. 625, 633, 636 (1986) (waiver &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*178&lt;/span&gt; of right to presence of counsel is assumed invalid unless accused initiates communication); &lt;i&gt;Maine&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Moulton,&lt;/i&gt; 474 U. S. 159, 176 (1985) (Sixth Amendment gives defendant right "to rely on counsel as a `medium' between him and the State"). Cf. ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 4.2 (2001) (lawyer is generally prohibited from communicating with a person known to be represented by counsel "about the subject of the representation" without counsel's "consent"); Green, A Prosecutor's Communications with Defendants: What Are the Limits?, 24 Crim. L. Bull. 283, 284, and n. 5 (1988) (version of Model Rule 4.2 or its predecessor has been adopted by all 50 States).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the particular aspect of the right here at issue&#151; the rule that the police ordinarily must communicate with the defendant through counsel&#151;has important limits. In particular, recognizing the need for law enforcement officials to investigate "new or additional crimes" not the subject of current proceedings, &lt;i&gt;Maine&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Moulton, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 179, this Court has made clear that the right to counsel does not attach to any and every crime that an accused may commit or have committed, see &lt;i&gt;McNeil&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin,&lt;/i&gt; 501 U. S. 171, 175-176 (1991). The right "cannot be invoked once for all future prosecutions," and it does not forbid "interrogation unrelated to the charge." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 175, 178. In a word, as this Court previously noted, the right is "offense specific." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 175.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case focuses upon the last-mentioned principle, in particular upon the meaning of the words "offense specific." These words appear in this Court's Sixth Amendment case law, not in the Sixth Amendment's text. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 6 (guaranteeing right to counsel "[i]n all criminal prosecutions"). The definition of these words is not selfevident. Sometimes the term "offense" may refer to words that are written in a criminal statute; sometimes it may refer generally to a course of conduct in the world, aspects of which constitute the elements of one or more crimes; and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*179&lt;/span&gt; sometimes it may refer, narrowly and technically, just to the conceptually severable aspects of the latter. This case requires us to determine whether an "offense"&#151;for Sixth Amendment purposes&#151;includes factually related aspects of a single course of conduct other than those few acts that make up the essential elements of the crime charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should answer this question in light of the Sixth Amendment's basic objectives as set forth in this Court's case law. At the very least, we should answer it in a way that does not undermine those objectives. But the Court today decides that "offense" means the crime set forth within "the four corners of a charging instrument," along with other crimes that "would be considered the same offense" under the test established by &lt;i&gt;Blockburger&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt;  284 U. S. 299 (1932). &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 173. In my view, this unnecessarily technical definition undermines Sixth Amendment protections while doing nothing to further effective law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, the majority's rule, while leaving the Fifth Amendment's protections in place, threatens to diminish severely the additional protection that, under this Court's rulings, the Sixth Amendment provides when it grants the right to counsel to defendants who have been charged with a crime and insists that law enforcement officers thereafter communicate with them through that counsel. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Michigan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jackson, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 632 (Sixth Amendment prevents police from questioning represented defendant through informants even when Fifth Amendment would not); &lt;i&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Innis,&lt;/i&gt; 446 U. S. 291, 300, n. 4 (1980) (Fifth Amendment right, unlike Sixth, applies only in custodial interrogation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Kennedy, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas, if not the majority, apparently believe these protections constitutionally unimportant, for, in their view, "the underlying theory of &lt;i&gt;Jackson&lt;/i&gt; seems questionable." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt;  at 174 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Both the majority and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*180&lt;/span&gt; concurring opinions suggest that a suspect's ability to invoke his Fifth Amendment right and "refuse any police questioning" offers that suspect adequate constitutional protection. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 172, n. 2 (majority opinion); see also &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 175-176 (Kennedy, J., concurring). But that is not so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jackson&lt;/i&gt; focuses upon a suspect&#151;perhaps a frightened or uneducated suspect&#151;who, hesitant to rely upon his own unaided judgment in his dealings with the police, has invoked his constitutional right to legal assistance in such matters. See &lt;i&gt;Michigan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jackson,&lt;/i&gt; 475 U. S., at 634, n. 7 ("`The simple fact that [a] defendant has requested an attorney indicates that he does not believe that he is sufficiently capable of dealing with his adversaries singlehandedly' ") (quoting &lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Bladel,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;421&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Mich.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;39&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 63-64, 365 N. W. 2d 56, 67 (1984)). &lt;i&gt;Jackson&lt;/i&gt; says that, once such a request has been made, the police may not simply throw that suspect&#151;who does not trust his own unaided judgment&#151;back upon his own devices by requiring him to rely for protection upon that same unaided judgment that he previously rejected as inadequate. In a word, the police may not force a suspect who has asked for legal counsel to make a critical legal choice without the legal assistance that he has requested and that the Constitution guarantees. See &lt;i&gt;McNeil&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 177&#151; 178 ("The purpose of the Sixth Amendment counsel guarantee . . . is to `protec[t] the unaided layman at critical confrontations' with his `expert adversary' ") (quoting &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gouveia,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 180, 189 (1984)). The Constitution does not take away with one hand what it gives with the other. See &lt;i&gt;Gideon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wainwright,&lt;/i&gt; 372 U. S., at 344 (Sixth Amendment means that a person charged with a crime need not "face his accusers without a lawyer to assist him"); &lt;i&gt;Michigan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jackson, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 633, 635 (presuming "that the defendant requests the lawyer's services at every critical stage of the prosecution" even if the defendant fails to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights at the time of interrogation); cf. &lt;i&gt;Edwards&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arizona,&lt;/i&gt; 451 U. S. 477, 484-485 (1981) (when &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*181&lt;/span&gt; accused has expressed desire to deal with police through counsel, police may not reinitiate interrogation until counsel has been made available); ABA Ann. Model Rule of Professional Conduct 4.2, p. 398, comment. (4th ed. 1999) ("Rule 4.2 . . . exists to prevent lawyers from taking advantage of uncounseled laypersons and to preserve the integrity of the lawyer-client relationship").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, the Sixth Amendment right at issue is independent of the Fifth Amendment's protections; and the importance of this Sixth Amendment right has been repeatedly recognized in our cases. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Michigan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jackson, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 636 ("We conclude that the assertion [of the right to counsel] is no less significant, and the need for additional safeguards no less clear, when the request for counsel is made at an arraignment and when the basis for the claim is the Sixth Amendment").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Kennedy primarily relies upon &lt;i&gt;Patterson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Illinois,&lt;/i&gt; 487 U. S. 285 (1988), in support of his conclusion that &lt;i&gt;Jackson&lt;/i&gt; is not good law. He quotes &lt;i&gt;Patterson&lt;/i&gt; `s statement that the Constitution does "`not ba[r] an accused from making an &lt;i&gt;initial&lt;/i&gt; election as to whether' " to speak with the police without counsel's assistance. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 175 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Patterson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Illinois, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 291).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement, however, cannot justify the overruling of &lt;i&gt;Jackson.&lt;/i&gt; That is because, in &lt;i&gt;Patterson&lt;/i&gt; itself, this Court noted, "as a matter of some significance," that, at the time he was interrogated, &lt;i&gt;the defendant had neither retained nor accepted the appointment of counsel.&lt;/i&gt; 487 U. S., at 290, n. 3. We characterized our holding in &lt;i&gt;Jackson&lt;/i&gt; as having depended upon "the fact that the accused `ha[d] asked for the help of a lawyer' in dealing with the police," 487 U. S., at 291 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Michigan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jackson, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 631), and explained that, "[o]nce an accused has a lawyer, a distinct set of constitutional safeguards aimed at preserving the sanctity of the attorney-client relationship takes effect," 487 U. S., at 290, n. 3 (citing &lt;i&gt;Maine&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Moulton,&lt;/i&gt; 474 U. S., at 176).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*182&lt;/span&gt; Justice Kennedy also criticizes &lt;i&gt;Jackson&lt;/i&gt; on the ground that it prevents a suspect "from . . . making th[e] choice" to "give . . . a forthright account of the events that occurred." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 177. But that is not so. A suspect may initiate communication with the police, thereby avoiding the risk that the police induced him to make, unaided, the kind of critical legal decision best made with the help of counsel, whom he has requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Justice Kennedy, the majority does not call &lt;i&gt;Jackson&lt;/i&gt; itself into question. But the majority would undermine that case by significantly diminishing the Sixth Amendment protections that the case provides. That is because criminal codes are lengthy and highly detailed, often proliferating "overlapping and related statutory offenses" to the point where prosecutors can easily "spin out a startlingly numerous series of offenses from a single . . . criminal transaction." &lt;i&gt;Ashe&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Swenson,&lt;/i&gt; 397 U. S. 436, 445, n. 10 (1970). Thus, an armed robber who reaches across a store counter, grabs the cashier, and demands "your money or your life," may through that single instance of conduct have committed several "offenses," in the majority's sense of the term, including armed robbery, assault, battery, trespass, use of a firearm to commit a felony, and perhaps possession of a firearm by a felon, as well. A person who is using and selling drugs on a single occasion might be guilty of possessing various drugs, conspiring to sell drugs, being under the influence of illegal drugs, possessing drug paraphernalia, possessing a gun in relation to the drug sale, and, depending upon circumstances, violating various gun laws as well. A protester blocking an entrance to a federal building might also be trespassing, failing to disperse, unlawfully assembling, and obstructing Government administration all at one and the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority's rule permits law enforcement officials to question those charged with a crime without first approaching counsel, through the simple device of asking questions about any other related crime not actually charged in &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*183&lt;/span&gt; the indictment. Thus, the police could ask the individual charged with robbery about, say, the assault of the cashier not yet charged, or about any other uncharged offense (unless under &lt;i&gt;Blockburger&lt;/i&gt; `s definition it counts as the "same crime"), all &lt;i&gt;without notifying counsel.&lt;/i&gt; Indeed, the majority's rule would permit law enforcement officials to question anyone charged with any crime in any one of the examples just given about his or her conduct on the single relevant occasion without notifying counsel unless the prosecutor has charged every possible crime arising out of that same brief course of conduct. What Sixth Amendment sense&#151; what common sense&#151;does such a rule make? What is left of the "communicate through counsel" rule? The majority's approach is inconsistent with any common understanding of the scope of counsel's representation. It will undermine the lawyer's role as "`medium' " between the defendant and the government. &lt;i&gt;Maine&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Moulton, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 176. And it will, on a random basis, remove a significant portion of the protection that this Court has found inherent in the Sixth Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, under the rule today announced by the majority, two of the seminal cases in our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence would have come out differently. In &lt;i&gt;Maine&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Moulton&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; which the majority points out "expressly referred to the offense-specific nature of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 170, we treated burglary and theft as the same offense for Sixth Amendment purposes. Despite the opinion's clear statement that "[i]ncriminating statements pertaining to other crimes, as to which the Sixth Amendment right has not yet attached, are, of course, admissible at a trial of those offenses," 474 U. S., at 180, n. 16, the Court affirmed the lower court's reversal of both burglary and theft charges even though, at the time that the incriminating statements at issue were made, Moulton had been charged only with theft by receiving, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 162, 167, 180. Under the majority's rule, in contrast, because theft by receiving &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*184&lt;/span&gt; and burglary each required proof of a fact that the other did not, only Moulton's theft convictions should have been overturned. Compare Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17&#151;A, &#167; 359 (1981) (theft) (requiring knowing receipt, retention, or disposal of stolen property with the intent to deprive the owner thereof), with &#167; 401 (burglary) (requiring entry of a structure without permission and with the intent to commit a crime).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Brewer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Williams&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; the effect of the majority's rule would have been even more dramatic. Because first-degree murder and child abduction each required proof of a fact not required by the other, and because at the time of the impermissible interrogation Williams had been charged only with abduction of a child, Williams' murder conviction should have remained undisturbed. See 430 U. S., at 390, 393-395, 406. Compare Iowa Code &#167; 690.2 (1950 and Supp. 1978) (first-degree murder) (requiring a killing) with Iowa Code &#167; 706.2 (1950) (repealed 1978) (child-stealing) (requiring proof that a child under 16 was taken with the intent to conceal the child from his or her parent or guardian). This is not to suggest that this Court has previously addressed and decided the question presented by this case. Rather, it is to point out that the Court's conception of the Sixth Amendment right at the time that &lt;i&gt;Moulton&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Brewer&lt;/i&gt; were decided naturally presumed that it extended to factually related but uncharged offenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the majority's rule threatens the legal clarity necessary for effective law enforcement. That is because the majority, aware that the word "offense" ought to encompass something beyond "the four corners of the charging instrument," imports into Sixth Amendment law the definition of "offense" set forth in &lt;i&gt;Blockburger&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 284 U. S. 299 (1932), a case interpreting the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which Clause uses the word "offence" but otherwise has no relevance here. Whatever Fifth Amendment virtues &lt;i&gt;Block-&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*185&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;burger&lt;/i&gt; may have, to import it into this Sixth Amendment context will work havoc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, the test says that two offenses are the "same offense" unless each requires proof of a fact that the other does not. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 173 (majority opinion). That means that most of the different crimes mentioned above are not the "same offense." Under many States' laws, for example, the statute defining assault and the statute defining robbery each requires proof of a fact that the other does not. Compare, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Cal. Penal Code Ann. &#167; 211 (West 1999) (robbery) (requiring taking of personal property of another) with &#167; 240 (assault) (requiring attempt to commit violent injury). Hence the extension of the definition of "offense" that is accomplished by the use of the &lt;i&gt;Blockburger&lt;/i&gt; test does nothing to address the substantial concerns about the circumvention of the Sixth Amendment right that are raised by the majority's rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, more to the point, the simple-sounding &lt;i&gt;Blockburger&lt;/i&gt;  test has proved extraordinarily difficult to administer in practice. Judges, lawyers, and law professors often disagree about how to apply it. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Woodward,&lt;/i&gt; 469 U. S. 105, 108 (1985) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; (holding that lower court misapplied &lt;i&gt;Blockburger&lt;/i&gt; test). Compare &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dixon,&lt;/i&gt; 509 U. S. 688, 697-700 (1993) (opinion of Scalia, J.) (applying &lt;i&gt;Blockburger&lt;/i&gt; and concluding that contempt is same offense as underlying substantive crime), with 509 U. S., at 716-720 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (applying &lt;i&gt;Blockburger&lt;/i&gt; and deciding that the two are separate offenses). The test has emerged as a tool in an area of our jurisprudence that The Chief Justice has described as "a veritable Sargasso Sea which could not fail to challenge the most intrepid judicial navigator." &lt;i&gt;Albernaz&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 450 U. S. 333, 343 (1981). Yet the Court now asks, not the lawyers and judges who ordinarily work with double jeopardy law, but police officers in the field, to navigate &lt;i&gt;Blockburger&lt;/i&gt; when they question &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*186&lt;/span&gt; suspects. Cf. &lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Belton,&lt;/i&gt; 453 U. S. 454, 458 (1981) (noting importance of clear rules to guide police behavior). Some will apply the test successfully; some will not. Legal challenges are inevitable. The result, I believe, will resemble not so much the Sargasso Sea as the criminal law equivalent of Milton's "Serbonian Bog . . . Where Armies whole have sunk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, an alternative. We can, and should, define "offense" in terms of the conduct that constitutes the crime that the offender committed on a particular occasion, including criminal acts that are "closely related to" or "inextricably intertwined with" the particular crime set forth in the charging instrument. This alternative is not perfect. The language used lacks the precision for which police officers may hope; and it requires lower courts to specify its meaning further as they apply it in individual cases. Yet virtually every lower court in the United States to consider the issue has defined "offense" in the Sixth Amendment context to encompass such closely related acts. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 168, n. 1 (majority opinion) (citing cases from the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits as well as state courts in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania); &lt;i&gt;Taylor&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/fladistctapp/a7Kg/taylor-v-state/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;726&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;So. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;841&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 845 (Fla. App. 1999); &lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Clankie,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ill/bo6u/people-v-clankie/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;124&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ill. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;456&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 462-466, 530 N. E. 2d 448, 451-453 (1988); &lt;i&gt;State&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tucker,&lt;/i&gt; 137 N. J. 259, 277-278, 645 A. 2d 111, 120-121 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U. S. 1090 (1995). These courts have found offenses "closely related" where they involved the same victim, set of acts, evidence, or motivation. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Taylor&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 845 (stolen property charges and burglary); &lt;i&gt;State&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tucker, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 278, 645 A. 2d, at 121 (burglary, robbery, and murder of home's occupant); &lt;i&gt;In re Pack,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/pasuperct/cFd3/in-interest-of-pack/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;420&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Pa. Super.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;347&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 355-356, 616 A. 2d 1006, 1010 (1992) (burglary, receiving stolen property, and theft charges), appeal denied, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;535&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Pa.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;669&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 634 A. 2d 1117 (1993). They have found offenses unrelated where time, location, or factual circumstances significantly separated the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*187&lt;/span&gt; one from the other. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rainwater,&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;425&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Mass.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;540&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 547-549, and n. 7, 681 N. E. 2d 1218, 1224, and n. 7 (1997) (vehicle theft charge and earlier vehicle thefts in same area), cert. denied, 522 U. S. 1095 (1998); &lt;i&gt;Whittlesey&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;340&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Md.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 56-57, 665 A. 2d 223, 236 (1995) (murder and making false statements charges), cert. denied, 516 U. S. 1148 (1996); &lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dotson,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/illappct/ctBn/people-v-dotson/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;214&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ill. App. 3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;637&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 646, 574 N. E. 2d 143, 149 (murder and weapons charges), appeal denied, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;141&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ill. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;549&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 580 N. E. 2d 123 (1991).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One cannot say in favor of this commonly followed approach that it is perfectly clear&#151;only that, because it comports with common sense, it is far easier to apply than that of the majority. One might add that, unlike the majority's test, it is consistent with this Court's assumptions in previous cases. See &lt;i&gt;Maine&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Moulton,&lt;/i&gt; 474 U. S., at 162, 167, 180 (affirming reversal of both burglary and theft convictions); &lt;i&gt;Brewer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Williams,&lt;/i&gt; 430 U. S., at 389, 390, 393, 406 (affirming grant of habeas which vacated murder conviction). And, most importantly, the "closely related" test furthers, rather than undermines, the Sixth Amendment's "right to counsel," a right so necessary to the realization in practice of that most "noble ideal," a fair trial. &lt;i&gt;Gideon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wainwright,&lt;/i&gt; 372 U. S., at 344.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, following this commonly accepted approach, found that the charged burglary and the uncharged murders were "closely related." All occurred during a short period of time on the same day in the same basic location. The victims of the murders were also victims of the burglary. Cobb committed one of the murders in furtherance of the robbery, the other to cover up the crimes. The police, when questioning Cobb, knew that he already had a lawyer representing him on the burglary charges and had demonstrated their belief that this lawyer also represented Cobb in respect to the murders by asking his permission to question Cobb about the murders on previous occasions. The relatedness of the crimes &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*188&lt;/span&gt; is well illustrated by the impossibility of questioning Cobb about the murders without eliciting admissions about the burglary. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Tr. 157 (Feb. 19, 1997) (testimony by police officer who obtained murder confession) ("Basically what he told us is he had gone over to the house to burglarize it and nobody was home"); 22 Record, State's Exh. 20 (typed statement by Cobb) (admitting that he committed the murders after entering the house and stealing stereo parts). Nor, in my view, did Cobb waive his right to counsel. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 180-181. These considerations are sufficient. The police officers ought to have spoken to Cobb's counsel before questioning Cobb. I would affirm the decision of the Texas court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, I dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

Super.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;347&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 354-356, 616 A. 2d 1006, 1010-1011 (1992).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Curiously, while predicting disastrous consequences for the core values underlying the Sixth Amendment, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 179-183 (opinion of Breyer, J.), the dissenters give short shrift to the Fifth Amendment's role (as expressed in &lt;i&gt;Miranda&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dickerson&lt;/i&gt; ) in protecting a defendant's right to consult with counsel before talking to police. Even though the Sixth Amendment right to counsel has not attached to uncharged offenses, defendants retain the ability under &lt;i&gt;Miranda&lt;/i&gt; to refuse any police questioning, and, indeed, charged defendants presumably have met with counsel and have had the opportunity to discuss whether it is advisable to invoke those Fifth Amendment rights. Thus, in all but the rarest of cases, the Court's decision today will have no impact whatsoever upon a defendant's ability to protect his Sixth Amendment right.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that, contrary to the dissent's suggestion, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 177-178, 179, there is no "background principle" of our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence establishing that there may be no contact between a defendant and police without counsel present. The dissent would expand the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel in a criminal prosecution into a rule which "`exists to prevent lawyers from taking advantage of uncounseled laypersons and to preserve the integrity of the lawyer-client relationship.' " &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 181 (quoting ABA Ann. Model Rule of Profesional Conduct 4.2 (4th ed. 1999)). Every profession is competent to define the standards of conduct for its members, but such standards are obviously not controlling in interpretation of constitutional provisions. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is personal to the defendant and specific to the offense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Inthis sense, we could just as easily describe the Sixth Amendment as "prosecution specific," insofar as it prevents discussion of charged offenses as well as offenses that, under &lt;i&gt;Blockburger,&lt;/i&gt; could not be the subject of a later prosecution. And, indeed, the text of the Sixth Amendment confines its scope to "all criminal &lt;i&gt;prosecutions.&lt;/i&gt; "&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*202&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*202&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*203&lt;/span&gt; Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Stevens, O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, and Breyer, JJ., joined. Scalia, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 220.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;James A. Feldman&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Acting Solicitor General Underwood, former Solicitor General Waxman, Acting Assistant Attorney General Junghans, Deputy Solicitor General Wallace, Kent L. Jones, Kenneth L. Greene,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Robert W. Metzler.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*204&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Carter G. Phillips&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Richard D. Bernstein, Stephen B. Kinnaird,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Anne Berleman Kearney.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Ginsburg, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) impose excise taxes on employee wages to fund Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment compensation programs. This case concerns the application of FICA and FUTA taxes to payments of back wages. The Internal Revenue Service has consistently maintained that, for tax purposes, backpay awards should be attributed to the year the award is actually paid. Respondent Cleveland Indians Baseball Company (Company) urges, and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held, that such awards must be allocated, as they are for purposes of Social Security benefits eligibility, to the periods in which the wages should have been paid. According due respect to the Service's reasonable, longstanding construction of the governing statutes and its own regulations, we hold that back wages are subject to FICA and FUTA taxes by reference to the year the wages are in fact paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursuant to a settlement of grievances asserted by the Major League Baseball Players Association concerning players' free agency rights, several Major League Baseball clubs agreed to pay $280 million to players with valid claims for salary damages. Under the agreement, the Company owed 8 players a total of $610,000 in salary damages for 1986, and it owed 14 players a total of $1,457,848 in salary damages for 1987. The Company paid the awards in 1994. No award recipient was a Company employee in that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*205&lt;/span&gt; This case concerns the proper FICA and FUTA tax treatment of the 1994 payments. Under FICA, both employees and employers must pay tax on wages to fund Social Security and Medicare; under FUTA, employers (but not employees) must pay tax on wages to fund unemployment benefits. For purposes of this litigation, the Government and the Company stipulated that the settlement payments awarded to the players qualify as "wages" within the meaning of FICA and FUTA. The question presented is whether those payments, characterized as back wages, should be taxed by reference to the year they were actually paid (1994), as the Government urges, or by reference to the years they should have been paid (1986 and 1987), as the Company and its supporting &lt;i&gt;amicus,&lt;/i&gt; the Major League Baseball Players Association, contend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any given year, the amount of FICA and FUTA tax owed depends on two determinants. The first is the tax rate. 26 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 3101, 3111 (FICA), &#167; 3301 (FUTA). The second is the statutory ceiling on taxable wages (also called the wage base), which limits the amount of annual wages subject to tax. &#167; 3121(a)(1) (FICA), &#167; 3306(b)(1) (FUTA). Both determinants have increased over time. In 1986, the Social Security tax on employees and employers was 5.7 percent on wages up to $42,000;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; in 1987, it was 5.7 percent on wages up to $43,800;&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; and in 1994, 6.2 percent on wages up to $60,600.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Although the Medicare tax on employees and employers remained constant at 1.45 percent from 1986 to 1994,&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; the taxable wage base rose from $42,000 in 1986 to $43,800 in 1987,&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; and by 1994, Congress had abolished the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*206&lt;/span&gt; wage ceiling, thereby subjecting all wages to the Medicare tax.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; In 1986 and 1987, the FUTA tax was 6.0 percent on wages up to $7,000;&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; in 1994, it was 6.2 percent on wages up to $7,000.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, allocating the 1994 payments back to 1986 and 1987 works to the advantage of the Company and its former employees. The reason is that all but one of the employees who received back wages in 1994 had already collected wages from the Company exceeding the taxable maximum in 1986 and 1987. Because those employees as well as the Company paid the maximum amount of employment taxes chargeable in 1986 and 1987, allocating the 1994 payments back to those years would generate no additional FICA or FUTA tax liability. By contrast, treating the back wages as taxable in 1994 would subject both the Company and its former employees to significant tax liability. The Company paid none of the employees any other wages in 1994,&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; and FICA and FUTA taxes attributable to that year &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*207&lt;/span&gt; would be calculated according to tax rates and wage bases higher than their levels in 1986 and 1987.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncertain about the proper rule of taxation, the Company paid its share of employment taxes on the back wages according to 1994 tax rates and wage bases. Its FICA payment totaled $99,382, and its FUTA payment totaled $1,008.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; After the Internal Revenue Service denied its claims for a refund of those payments, the Company initiated this action in District Court, relying on &lt;i&gt;Bowman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 824 F. 2d 528 (CA6 1987). In &lt;i&gt;Bowman,&lt;/i&gt; the Sixth Circuit held that "[a] settlement for back wages should not be allocated to the period when the employer finally pays but `should be allocated to the periods when the regular wages were not paid as usual.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 530 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Social Security Bd.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Nierotko,&lt;/i&gt; 327 U. S. 358, 370 (1946)). The District Court, bound by &lt;i&gt;Bowman,&lt;/i&gt; entered judgment for the Company and ordered the Government to refund $97,202 in FICA and FUTA taxes.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On appeal, the Government observed that two Courts of Appeals have held, in disagreement with &lt;i&gt;Bowman,&lt;/i&gt; that under the law as implemented by Treasury Regulations, wages are to be taxed for FICA purposes in the year they are actually received. &lt;i&gt;Walker&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 202 F. 3d 1290, 1292-1293 (CA10 2000) (finding &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; "inapposite" and &lt;i&gt;Bowman&lt;/i&gt; "unpersuasive"); &lt;i&gt;Hemelt&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 122 F. 3d 204, 210 (CA4 1997) (finding it "clear under the Treasury Regulations that `wages' are to be taxed for FICA purposes in the year in which they are received"). The Court &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*208&lt;/span&gt; of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit nevertheless affirmed on the authority of &lt;i&gt;Bowman.&lt;/i&gt; 215 F. 3d 1325 (2000) (judgt. order).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among the Courts of Appeals, 531 U. S. 943 (2000), and now reverse the Sixth Circuit's judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internal Revenue Code imposes employment taxes "on every employer . . . equal to [a percentage of] wages . . . paid by him with respect to employment." 26 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 3111(a), 3111(b), 3301. The Social Security tax provision, &#167; 3111(a), contains a table prescribing tax rates applicable to "wages paid during" each year from 1984 onward (&lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; "In cases of wages paid during . . . 1990 or thereafter . . . [t]he rate shall be . . . 6.2 percent."). The Medicare tax provision, &#167; 3111(b)(6), says "with respect to wages paid after December 31, 1985, the rate shall be 1.45 percent." And the FUTA tax provision, 26 U. S. C. &#167; 3301 (1994 ed., Supp. IV), says the rate shall be "6.2 percent in the case of calendar years 1988 through 2007 . . . of the total wages (as defined in section 3306(b)) paid by [the employer] during the calendar year."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 3121(a) of the Code establishes the annual ceiling on wages subject to Social Security tax. It does so by defining "wages" to exclude any remuneration "paid to [an] individual by [an] employer during [a] calendar year" that exceeds "remuneration . . . equal to the contribution and benefit base . . . paid to [such] individual by [such] employer during the calendar year with respect to which such contribution and benefit base is effective." Section 3306(b)(1) similarly limits annual wages subject to FUTA tax by excluding from "wages" any remuneration "paid to [an] individual by [an] employer during [a] calendar year" that exceeds "remuneration . . . equal to $7,000 . . . paid to [such] individual by [such] employer during [the] calendar year."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*209&lt;/span&gt; Both sides in this controversy have offered plausible interpretations of Congress' design. We set out next the parties' positions and explain why we ultimately defer to the Internal Revenue Service's reasonable, consistent, and longstanding interpretation of the FICA and FUTA provisions in point. Under that interpretation, wages must be taxed according to the year they are actually paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Government's view, the text of the controlling FICA and FUTA tax provisions explicitly instructs that employment taxes shall be computed by applying the tax rate and wage base in effect when wages are actually paid. In particular, the Government calls attention to the statute's constant references to &lt;i&gt;wages paid during a calendar year&lt;/i&gt; as the touchstone for determining the applicable tax rate and wage base. 26 U. S. C. &#167; 3111(a) (setting Social Security tax rates for "wages paid during" particular calendar years); &#167; 3121(a) (defining Social Security wage base in terms of "remuneration . . . paid . . . during the calendar year"); &#167; 3301 (setting FUTA tax rate as a percentage of "wages . . . paid . . . during the calendar year"); &#167; 3306(b)(1) (defining FUTA wage base in terms of "remuneration . . . paid . . . during any calendar year"). The meaning of this language, the Government contends, is plain: Wages are taxed according to the calendar year they are in fact paid, regardless of when they should have been paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In support of this reading, the Government observes that Congress chose the words in the current statute specifically to replace language in the original 1935 Social Security Act providing that FICA and FUTA tax rates applied to wages paid or received "with respect to &lt;i&gt;employment during the calendar year.&lt;/i&gt; " Social Security Act (1935 Act), &#167;&#167; 801, 804, 901, 49 Stat. 636-637, 639 (emphasis added). The Treasury Department had interpreted this 1935 language to mean that wages are taxed at "the rate in effect &lt;i&gt;at the time of the&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*210&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;performance of the services&lt;/i&gt; for which the wages were paid." Treas. Regs. 91, Arts. 202, 302 (1936) (emphasis added). In 1939, Congress amended the 1935 Act to provide that FICA and FUTA tax rates would no longer apply on the basis of when services were performed, but would instead apply "with respect to &lt;i&gt;wages paid during the calendar yea[r].&lt;/i&gt; " Social Security Act Amendments of 1939 (1939 Amendments), &#167;&#167; 604, 608, 53 Stat. 1383, 1387 (emphasis added). This 1939 language remains essentially unchanged in the current FICA and FUTA tax provisions, 26 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 3111(a) and 3301.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging that the 1939 Amendments established a "wages paid" rule for FICA and FUTA taxation, the Company nevertheless argues that &lt;i&gt;Social Security Bd.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Nierotko,&lt;/i&gt; 327 U. S. 358 (1946), undermines the Government's plain language argument. According due weight to our precedent, we agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Nierotko,&lt;/i&gt; the National Labor Relations Board had ordered the reinstatement of a wrongfully discharged employee with "back pay" covering wages lost during the period from February 1937 to September 1939. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 359. The employer paid the award in July 1941. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 359-360. The primary question presented and aired in the Court's opinion was whether backpay for a time in which the employee was not on the job should nevertheless count as "wages" in determining the employee's eligibility for Social Security benefits. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 359. Notwithstanding the contrary view of the Social Security Board and the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the Court held that backpay covering the wrongful discharge period met the definition of "wages" in the 1935 Act. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 360-370.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final two paragraphs of the &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; opinion, the Court took up the question of how the backpay award should be allocated for purposes of determining the worker's eligibility for benefits. As originally enacted, the Social Security Act extended benefits to persons over 65 who had &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*211&lt;/span&gt; earned at least $2,000 in wages in each of any five years after 1936. 1935 Act, &#167;&#167; 201(a), 210(c), 49 Stat. 622, 625. In 1939, however, Congress introduced a new scheme, which remains in place today, tying eligibility for benefits to the number of calendar-year "quarters of coverage" accumulated by an individual. 1939 Amendments, &#167;&#167; 209(g), (h), 53 Stat. 1376&#151; 1377 (codified at 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 413(a)(2), 414). Section 209(g) defined a "quarter of coverage" as either "a calendar quarter in which the individual has been paid not less than $50 in wages" or any quarter except the first "where an individual has been paid in a calendar year $3,000 or more in wages." 53 Stat. 1377.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; swiftly dispatched the question whether "`back pay' must be allocated as wages . . . to the `calendar quarters' of the year in which the money would have been earned, if the employee had not been wrongfully discharged." 327 U. S., at 370. Rejecting the Government's argument that such allocation was impermissible because the 1939 Amendments to the benefits scheme refer to "`wages' to be `paid' in certain `quarters,' " &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 370, and n. 25 (citing &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 362, n. 7 (citing &#167; 209(g))), the Court concluded: "If, as we have held above, `back pay' is to be treated as wages, we have no doubt that it should be allocated to the periods when the regular wages were not paid as usual." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 370.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the allocation question in &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; was a secondary issue addressed summarily by the Court, we think the Company is correct that &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; undercuts the plain meaning argument urged by the Government here. &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt;  found no conflict between an allocation-back rule for backpay and the language in &#167; 209(g) tying benefits eligibility to the number of calendar quarters "in which" a minimum amount of "wages" "has been paid." The Court's allocation holding for benefits eligibility purposes, which the Government does not urge us to overrule, Tr. of Oral Arg. 9, thus turned on an implicit construction of &#167; 209(g)'s terms&#151;"wages" "paid" "in" "a calendar quarter"&#151;to include "regular wages" that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*212&lt;/span&gt; should have been paid but "were not paid as usual," 327 U. S., at 370. Given this construction of &#167; 209(g), now codified in 42 U. S. C. &#167; 413(a)(2), we cannot say that the FICA and FUTA provisions prescribing tax rates based on &lt;i&gt;wages paid during a calendar year,&lt;/i&gt; codified in 26 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 3111(a), 3301, have a plain meaning that precludes allocation of backpay to the year it should have been paid. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Hilton&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;South Carolina Public Railways Comm'n,&lt;/i&gt; 502 U. S. 197, 205 (1991) ("&lt;i&gt;stare decisis&lt;/i&gt; is most compelling" where "a pure question of statutory construction" is involved).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, we part ways with the Company. Although we agree that &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; blocks the Government's argument that the "wages paid" formulation in 26 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 3111(a) and 3301 has a dispositively plain meaning, we reject the Company's next contention. Because &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; read the 1939 "wages paid" language for benefits eligibility purposes to accommodate an allocation-back rule for backpay, the Company urges, the identical 1939 "wages paid" language for tax purposes must be read the same way. We do not agree that the latter follows from the former like the night, the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; dealt specifically and only with Social Security benefits eligibility, not with taxation. The Court's allocation holding in &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; in all likelihood reflected concern that the benefits scheme created in 1939 would be disserved by allowing an employer's wrongdoing to reduce the quarters of coverage an employee would otherwise be entitled to claim toward eligibility. No similar concern underlies the tax provisions. Although Social Security taxes are used to pay for Social Security benefits in the aggregate, there is no direct relation between taxes and benefits at the level of an individual employee. As the Company itself acknowledges, "Social Security tax `contributions,' unlike private pension contributions, do not create in the contributor a property right to benefits against the government, and wages rather &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*213&lt;/span&gt; than [tax] contributions are the statutory basis for calculating an individual's benefits." Brief for Respondent 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; thus does not compel symmetrical construction of the "wages paid" language in the discrete taxation and benefits eligibility contexts. Although we generally presume that "identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning," &lt;i&gt;Atlantic Cleaners &amp;amp; Dyers, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 286 U. S. 427, 433 (1932), the presumption "is not rigid," and "the meaning [of the same words] well may vary to meet the purposes of the law," &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Cf. Cook, "Substance" and "Procedure" in the Conflict of Laws, 42 Yale L. J. 333, 337 (1933) ("The tendency to assume that a word which appears in two or more legal rules, and so in connection with more than one purpose, has and should have precisely the same scope in all of them . . . has all the tenacity of original sin and must constantly be guarded against."). The benefits scheme delineated in Title 42 would "no doubt" be set awry without an allocation-back rule for back wages, notwithstanding "accounting difficulties." &lt;i&gt;Nierotko,&lt;/i&gt; 327 U. S., at 370. But that surely cannot be said for the taxation scheme described in Title 26, where Congress' evident concern was not worker eligibility for benefits, but fiscal administrability.&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*214&lt;/span&gt; The 1939 Amendments adopting the "wages paid" rule for taxation reflected Congress' worry that, as tax rates increase from year to year, "difficulties and confusion" would attend the taxation of wages payable in one year, but not actually paid until another year. S. Rep. No. 734, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 75-76; see also H. R. Rep. No. 728, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 57-58. Congress understood that an employee's annual compensation may be "based on a percentage of profits, or on future royalties, the amount of which cannot be determined until long after the close of the year." S. Rep. No. 734, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., at 75. Requiring employers to "estimate unascertained amounts and pay taxes and contributions on that basis" would "cause a burden on employers and administrative authorities alike." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 75&#151; 76. Congress correctly anticipated that "[t]he placing of [FICA and FUTA] tax[es] on the `wages paid' basis [would] relieve this situation." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 76. "Under the amendment the rate applicable would be the rate in effect at the time that the wages are paid and received without reference to the rate which was in effect at the time the services were performed." H. R. Rep. No. 728, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 58.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an additional ground for construing the tax and benefits provisions &lt;i&gt;in pari materia,&lt;/i&gt; the Company insists that Congress incorporated &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; `s treatment of backpay into the tax provisions when it amended the Social Security Act shortly after &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; was decided. Prior to 1946, the FICA and FUTA wage bases had been defined in terms of remuneration "paid . . . with respect to employment during" a given year. 1935 Act, &#167; 811(a), 49 Stat. 639 (FICA); 1939 Amendments, &#167; 606, 53 Stat. 1383 (FUTA). Paralleling the 1939 Amendments to the tax rate provisions, Congress in 1946 established the current "wages paid" rule for identifying the wages that compose the FICA and FUTA wage bases in a given year. Social Security Act Amendments of 1946 (1946 Amendments), &#167;&#167; 412, 414, 60 Stat. 989-991 (codified at 26 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 3121(a), 3306(b)(1)). The 1946 law amended &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*215&lt;/span&gt; &#167; 209(a), which defines the Social Security wage base for purposes of benefits calculation, by adopting the "wages paid" language already present in &#167; 209(g), the provision construed in &lt;i&gt;Nierotko.&lt;/i&gt; &#167; 414, 60 Stat. 990-991. Congress also used identical "wages paid" language in redefining the FICA and FUTA wage bases for tax purposes. &#167; 412, 60 Stat. 989. Relying on the presumption that &#167; 209(a), as amended, incorporated &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; `s construction of &#167; 209(g), see &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;University of Chicago,&lt;/i&gt; 441 U. S. 677, 696-699 (1979), and observing that Congress redefined the wage bases for taxation to "confor[m] with the changes in section 209(a)," S. Rep. No. 1862, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 36 (1946); H. R. Rep. No. 2447, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 35 (1946), the Company urges that the amended benefits and tax provisions codified &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; `s backpay allocation rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are unpersuaded. Even assuming that the benefits provision, &#167; 209(a), is properly construed as incorporating &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; `s reading of &#167; 209(g), we think the "confor[mity]" Congress sought to achieve between the tax and benefits provisions, S. Rep. No. 1862, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 36; H. R. Rep. No. 2447, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 35, had nothing to do with &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; `s treatment of backpay. The Committee Reports make clear that Congress' purpose in amending the FICA and FUTA wage bases was to define the "yardstick" for measuring "wages" as &lt;i&gt;"the amount paid during the calendar year . . . , without regard to the year in which the employment occurred."&lt;/i&gt; S. Rep. No. 1862, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 35 (emphasis added); H. R. Rep. No. 2447, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 35 (emphasis added). It is with respect to this rule&#151;measuring "wages" based on "the amount paid during the calendar year"&#151;that Congress sought conformity between the Title 26 tax provisions and the Title 42 benefits provision. See S. Rep. No. 1862, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt;  at 36 (tax wage base), 37 (benefits wage base); H. R. Rep. No. 2447, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 35 (tax wage base), 36 (benefits wage base). Far from indicating an intent to codify &lt;i&gt;Nierotko,&lt;/i&gt;  those Reports suggest that Congress, if it considered &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*216&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; at all, considered it an exception to the general rule for measuring "wages" in a given year.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt; Because the concern that animates &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; `s treatment of backpay in the benefits context has no relevance to the tax side, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt;  at 212-213, it makes no sense to attribute to Congress a desire for conformity not only with respect to the general rule for measuring "wages," but also with respect to &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; `s backpay exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;C&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were the Company to rely solely on arguments for symmetry in statutory construction, we would be inclined to conclude, given &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; `s lack of concern with taxation, that the tax provisions themselves, informed by legislative purpose, require back wages to be taxed according to the year they are actually paid. But the Company has one more arrow in its quiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from its arguments for symmetry, the Company contends that the Government's refusal to allocate back wages to the year they should have been paid creates inequities &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*217&lt;/span&gt; in taxation and incentives for strategic behavior that Congress did not intend. This contention is not without force. Under the Government's rule, an employee who should have been paid $100,000 in 1986, but is instead paid $50,000 in 1986 and $50,000 in backpay in 1994, would owe more tax than if she had been paid the full $100,000 due in 1986. Conversely, a wrongdoing employer who should have paid an employee $50,000 in each of five years covered by a $250,000 backpay award would pay only one year's worth of employment taxes (limited by the annual ceilings on taxable wages) in the year the award is actually paid. The Government's rule thus appears to exempt some wages that should be taxed and to tax some wages that should be exempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying the Government's rule to other provisions of the Code produces similar anomalies. Section 3121(a)(4), for example, exempts disability benefits from FICA tax if paid by an employer to an employee more than six months after the employee worked for the employer. 26 U. S. C. &#167; 3121(a)(4). Disability benefits included in a backpay award would be exempt from FICA tax if the employee had not worked for the employer for six months prior to the backpay award, even if the benefits should have been paid within six months after the employee stopped working for the employer. According to the Company, such results amount to tax windfalls and invite employers wrongfully to withhold pay or benefits in order to reap the advantages of a strategically timed payment. See Brief for Respondent 33-40 (additional examples of windfalls and avoidance schemes). These outcomes may be avoided, the Company argues, by construing the tax provisions to require taxation of back wages according to the year the wages should have been paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, of course, true that statutory construction "is a holistic endeavor" and that the meaning of a provision is "clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme . . . [when] only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*218&lt;/span&gt; effect that is compatible with the rest of the law." &lt;i&gt;United Sav. Assn. of Tex.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd.,&lt;/i&gt; 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988). The Company's examples leave little doubt that the Government's rule generates a degree of arbitrariness in the operation of the tax statutes. But in &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; `s context, an inflexible rule allocating backpay to the year it is actually paid would never work to the employee's advantage; it could inure &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; to the detriment of the employee, counter to the thrust of the benefits eligibility provisions.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; In this case, by contrast, there is no comparable structural unfairness in taxation. The Government's rule sometimes disadvantages the taxpayer, as in this case. Other times it works to the disadvantage of the fisc, as the Company's examples show. The anomalous results to which the Company points must be considered in light of Congress' evident interest in reducing complexity and minimizing administrative confusion within the FICA and FUTA tax schemes. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 214. Given the practical administrability concerns that underpin the tax provisions, we cannot say that the Government's rule is incompatible with the statutory scheme. The most we can say is that Congress intended the tax provisions to be both efficiently administrable and fair, and that this case reveals the tension that sometimes exists when Congress seeks to meet those twin aims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confronted with this tension, "we do not sit as a committee of revision to perfect the administration of the tax laws." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Correll,&lt;/i&gt; 389 U. S. 299, 306-307 (1967). Instead, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*219&lt;/span&gt; we defer to the Commissioner's regulations as long as they "implement the congressional mandate in some reasonable manner." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 307. "We do this because Congress has delegated to the [Commissioner], not to the courts, the task of prescribing all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of the Internal Revenue Code." &lt;i&gt;National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 440 U. S. 472, 477 (1979) (citing &lt;i&gt;Correll,&lt;/i&gt; 389 U. S.,at 307 (citing 26 U. S. C. &#167; 7805(a))). This delegation "helps guarantee that the rules will be written by `masters of the subject' . . . who will be responsible for putting the rules into effect." 440 U. S., at 477 (quoting &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Moore,&lt;/i&gt; 95 U. S. 760, 763 (1878)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internal Revenue Service has long maintained regulations interpreting the FICA and FUTA tax provisions. In their current form, the regulations specify that the employer tax "attaches &lt;i&gt;at the time that the wages are paid&lt;/i&gt; by the employer," 26 CFR &#167; 31.3111-3 (2000) (emphasis added), and "is computed by applying to the wages paid by the employer the rate in effect &lt;i&gt;at the time such wages are paid,&lt;/i&gt; " &#167; 31.3111-2(c) (emphasis added); see &#167;&#167; 31.3301-2, &#151;3(b) (same for FUTA). Echoing the language in 26 U. S. C. &#167; 3111(a) (FICA tax) and &#167; 3301 (FUTA tax), these regulations have continued unchanged in their basic substance since 1940. See T. D. 6516, 25 Fed. Reg. 13032 (1960); Treas. Regs. 107 (as amended by T. D. 5566, 1947-2 Cum. Bull. 148); Treas. Regs. 106 (as amended by T. D. 5566, 1947-2 Cum. Bull. 148); Treas. Regs. 106, &#167;&#167; 402.301&#151;.303, 402.401&#151;.403 (1940). Cf. &lt;i&gt;National Muffler,&lt;/i&gt; 440 U. S., at 477 ("A regulation may have particular force if it is a substantially contemporaneous construction of the statute by those presumed to have been aware of congressional intent.").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the regulations, like the statute, do not specifically address backpay, the Internal Revenue Service has consistently interpreted them to require taxation of back wages according to the year the wages are actually paid, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*220&lt;/span&gt; regardless of when those wages were earned or should have been paid. Rev. Rul. 89-35, 1989-1 Cum. Bull. 280; Rev. Rul. 78-336, 1978-2 Cum. Bull. 255. We need not decide whether the Revenue Rulings themselves are entitled to deference. In this case, the Rulings simply reflect the agency's longstanding interpretation of its own regulations. Because that interpretation is reasonable, it attracts substantial judicial deference. &lt;i&gt;Thomas Jefferson Univ.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Shalala,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S. 504, 512 (1994). We do not resist according such deference in reviewing an agency's steady interpretation of its own 61-year-old regulation implementing a 62year-old statute. "Treasury regulations and interpretations long continued without substantial change, applying to unamended or substantially reenacted statutes, are deemed to have received congressional approval and have the effect of law." &lt;i&gt;Cottage Savings Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 499 U. S. 554, 561 (1991) (citing &lt;i&gt;Correll,&lt;/i&gt; 389 U. S., at 305-306).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with the text and administrative history of the relevant taxation provisions, we hold that, for FICA and FUTA tax purposes, back wages should be attributed to the year in which they are actually paid. Accordingly, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I believed that the text of the tax statutes addressed the issue before us, I might well find for the respondent, giving that text the same meaning the Court found it to have in the benefits provisions of the Social Security Act. See &lt;i&gt;Social Security Bd.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Nierotko,&lt;/i&gt; 327 U. S. 358, 370, and n. 25 (1946). The Court's principal reason for assigning the identical language a different meaning in the present case&#151; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*221&lt;/span&gt; leaving aside statements in testimony and Committee Reports that I have no reason to believe Congress was aware of&#151;is that tax assessments do not present the equitable considerations implicated by the potential arbitrary decrease of benefits in &lt;i&gt;Nierotko.&lt;/i&gt; See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 212-213. But the Court acknowledges that departing from &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; will produce arbitrary variations in tax liability. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 216-218. As between an immediate arbitrary increase in tax liability and a deferred arbitrary decrease in benefits, I cannot say the latter is the greater inequity. The difference is at least not so stark as to cause me to regard the two regulatory schemes as different in kind, which I would insist upon before giving different meanings to identical statutory texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, however, I do not think that the text of the FICA and FUTA provisions, 26 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 3111(a), 3111(b), 3301, addresses the issue we face today. Those provisions, which direct that taxes shall be assessed against "wages paid" during the calendar year, would be controlling if the income we had before us were "wages" within the normal meaning of that term; but it is not. The question we face is whether &lt;i&gt;damages awards compensating an employee for lost wages&lt;/i&gt;  should be regarded for tax purposes as wages paid when the award is received, or rather as wages paid when they would have been paid but for the employer's unlawful actions. (The parties have stipulated that the damages awards should be regarded as taxable "wages paid" of some sort, see also &lt;i&gt;Social Security Bd.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Nierotko, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 364&#151; 370.) The proper treatment of such damages awards is an issue the statute does not address, and hence it is an issue left to the reasonable resolution of the administering agency, here the Internal Revenue Service. In &lt;i&gt;Nierotko,&lt;/i&gt; which we decided at a time when it was common for courts to fill statutory gaps that would now be left to the agency, we provided one rule for purposes of the benefits provisions. The Internal Revenue Service has since provided another &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*222&lt;/span&gt; rule for purposes of the tax provisions. Both rules are reasonable; neither is compelled; and neither involves a direct application of the statutory term "wages paid" which would require (or at least strongly suggest) a uniform result. I therefore concur in the Court's judgment deferring to the Government's regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[9]  If a player received wages in 1994 from another employer in addition to receiving back wages from the Company, the player&#151;but not the Company&#151;would be entitled to a credit or refund of any Social Security tax paid in excess of the amount of tax due on a single taxable wage base ($60,600). 26 U. S. C. &#167; 6413(c)(1). To illustrate, suppose a player received $50,000 in back wages from the Cleveland Indians and an additional $50,000 in wages from the New York Mets in 1994. Assuming all $100,000 in wages are taxed in 1994, the player would be entitled to a credit or refund of Social Security tax paid in excess of the amount of tax due on $60,600.

Thus, under the Government's proposed rule, the Cleveland Indians would owe Social Security taxes on all amounts up to $60,600 that it paid to each player in 1994, regardless of whether the players themselves had reached or exceeded the $60,600 ceiling through multiple wage sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[10]  Although the Company also withheld $99,382 to pay the employees' share of FICA taxes, it does not seek to recover any taxes paid on behalf of the employees in this suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[11]  This amount is slightly less than the total FICA and FUTA taxes paid by the Company in 1994. The reason is that one of the employees who received a 1994 payment for wages due in 1987 received no wages from the Company in 1987. The Company thus owed a small amount of FICA and FUTA taxes on the back wages paid to him even when those wages were allocated back to 1987.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[12]  In determining that "accounting difficulties" were "not . . . insuperable" to its allocation holding, &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; noted that "`backpay' is now treated distributively" under &#167; 119 of the Revenue Act of 1943. 327 U. S., at 370, and n. 26. Section 119 provided that backpay exceeding 15 percent of gross income may be allocated to earlier periods for income tax purposes if such allocation would reduce the taxpayer's liability. &#167; 119(a), 58 Stat. 39. But Congress eliminated the 1943 backpay allocation rule in 1964, see Pub. L. 88-272, &#167; 232(a), 78 Stat. 107, leaving behind the principle, "too firmly embedded in the income tax law to permit of any question," that "payments of compensation are income to a taxpayer on a cash basis in the year of receipt, as distinguished from the year in which the compensation is earned," 2 J. Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation &#167; 12.42, p. 179 (1973). The symmetry urged by the Company in construing the tax and benefits provisions of FICA and FUTA thus comes only at the expense of asymmetry in the collection of income taxes and employment taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[13]  Indeed, the contemporaneous understanding of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue was that the 1946 Amendments supplanted &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; `s allocation rule for backpay. See Letter from Joseph D. Nunan, Jr., Commissioner of Internal Revenue, to Social Security Administration, Bureau of Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (Mar. 6, 1947) ("The &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; decision requiring your Agency to make an allocation of the back pay award to prior periods was rendered on the basis of the law in effect at that time. The Social Security Act Amendments of 1946, having been enacted subsequent to the date of the &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; decision, must be interpreted in the light of the language contained in such Amendments and the Congressional intent.") (available in Lodging for Respondent, Exh. F). Nevertheless, for benefits eligibility and calculation purposes, the Social Security Administration (SSA) by regulation continues to apply the &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; rule to "[b]ack pay under a statute," 20 CFR &#167; 404.1242(b) (2000) (such backpay "is allocated to the periods of time in which it should have been paid if the employer had not violated the statute"), while declining to apply &lt;i&gt;Nierotko&lt;/i&gt; to "[b]ack pay not under a statute," &#167; 404.1242(c) ("This back pay cannot be allocated to prior periods of time but must be reported by the employer for the period in which it is paid.").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[14]  The SSA has interpreted its regulation governing "[b]ack pay under a statute," 20 CFR &#167; 404.1242(b) (2000), to allow the employee to choose whether to allocate the back pay to the year it is paid or to the year it should have been paid. Social Security Administration, Reporting Back Pay and Special Wage Payments to the Social Security Administration 2, Pub. 957 (Sept. 1997).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="docket"&gt;No. 99-1908.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="court"&gt;SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="date"&gt;Argued January 16, 2001&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="date"&gt;Decided April 24, 2001&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="prelims"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Syllabus&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As a recipient of federal financial assistance, the Alabama Department of Public Safety (Department), of which petitioner Alexander is the Director, is subject to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Section 601 of that Title prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in covered programs and activities. Section 602 authorizes federal agencies to effectuate 601 by issuing regulations, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) in an exercise of this authority promulgated a regulation forbidding funding recipients to utilize criteria or administrative methods having the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination based on the prohibited grounds. Respondent Sandoval brought this class action to enjoin the Department's decision to administer state driver's license examinations only in English, arguing that it violated the DOJ regulation because it had the effect of subjecting non-English speakers to discrimination based on their national origin. Agreeing, the District Court enjoined the policy and ordered the Department to accommodate non-English speakers. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed. Both courts rejected petitioners' argument that Title VI did not provide respondents a cause of action to enforce the regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Held: There is no private right of action to enforce disparate-impact regulations promulgated under Title VI. Pp. 3-17.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(a) Three aspects of Title VI must be taken as given. First, private individuals may sue to enforce 601. See, e.g., Cannon v. University of Chicago, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yHT/cannon-v-university-of-chicago/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;441&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;677&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 694, 696, 699, 703, 710-711. Second, 601 prohibits only intentional discrimination. See, e.g., Alexander v. Choate, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z5X/alexander-v-choate/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;469&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;287&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 293. Third, it must be assumed for purposes of deciding this case that regulations promulgated under 602 may validly proscribe activities that have a disparate impact on racial groups, even though such activities are permissible under 601. Pp. 3-5.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(b) This Court has not, however, held that Title VI disparate-impact regulations may be enforced through a private right of action. Cannon was decided on the assumption that the respondent there had intentionally discriminated against the petitioner, see 441 U.S., at 680. In Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yZW/guardians-assn-v-civil-serv-commn-of-new-york-city/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;463&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;582&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the Court held that private individuals could not recover compensatory damages under Title VI except for intentional discrimination. Of the five Justices who also voted to uphold disparate-impact regulations, three expressly reserved the question of a direct private right of action to enforce them, 463 U.S., at 645, n. 18. Pp. 5-7.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(c) Nor does it follow from the three points taken as given that Congress must have intended such a private right of action. There is no doubt that regulations applying 601's ban on intentional discrimination are covered by the cause of action to enforce that section. But the disparate-impact regulations do not simply apply 601-since they forbid conduct that 601 permits-and thus the private right of action to enforce 601 does not include a private right to enforce these regulations. See Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B2F/central-bank-of-denver-na-v-first-interstate-bank-/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;511&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;164&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 173. That right must come, if at all, from the independent force of 602. Pp. 7-10.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(d) Like substantive federal law itself, private rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by Congress. Touche Ross &amp;amp; Co. v. Redington, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yJu/touche-ross-co-v-redington/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;442&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;560&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 578. This Court will not revert to the understanding of private causes of action, represented by J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xLa/ji-case-co-v-borak/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;377&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;426&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 433, that held sway when Title VI was enacted. That understanding was abandoned in Cort v. Ash, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yuf/cort-v-ash/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;422&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;66&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 78. Nor does the Court agree with the Government's contention that cases interpreting statutes enacted prior to Cort v. Ash have given dispositive weight to the expectations that the enacting Congress had formed in light of the contemporary legal context. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp;amp; Smith, Inc. v. Curran, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yUD/merrill-lynch-pierce-fenner-smith-inc-v-curran/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;456&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;353&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 378-379; Cannon, supra, at 698-699; and Thompson v. Thompson, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zhA/thompson-v-thompson/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;484&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;174&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, distinguished. Pp. 10-12.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(e) The search for Congress's intent in this case begins and ends with Title VI's text and structure. The "rights-creating" language so critical to Cannon's 601 analysis, 441 U.S., at 690, n. 13, is completely absent from 602. Whereas 601 decrees that "[n]o person ... shall ... be subjected to discrimination," 602 limits federal agencies to "effectuat[ing]" rights created by 601. And 602 focuses neither on the individuals protected nor even on the funding recipients being regulated, but on the regulating agencies. Hence, there is far less reason to infer a private remedy in favor of individual persons, Cannon, supra, at 690-691. The methods 602 expressly provides for enforcing its regulations, which place elaborate restrictions on agency enforcement, also suggest a congressional intent not to create a private remedy through 602. See, e.g., Karahalios v. Federal Employees, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zmJ/karahalios-v-federal-employees/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;489&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;527&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 533. Pp. 12-15.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(f) The Court rejects arguments that the regulations at issue contain rights-creating language and so must be privately enforceable; that amendments to Title VI in 1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986 and 6 of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 "ratified" decisions finding an implied private right of action to enforce the regulations; and that the congressional intent to create a right of action must be inferred under Curran, supra, at 353, 381-382. Pp. 15-17.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;197&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;484&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined. Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This case presents the question whether private individuals may sue to enforce disparate-impact regulations promulgated under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p2"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;* The Alabama Department of Public Safety (Department), of which petitioner James Alexander is the Director, accepted grants of financial assistance from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of Transportation (DOT) and so subjected itself to the restrictions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, as amended, 42 U.S.C.  2000d et seq. Section 601 of that Title provides that no person shall, "on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity" covered by Title VI. 42 U.S.C.  2000d. Section 602 authorizes federal agencies "to effectuate the provisions of [601] ... by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability," 42 U.S.C.  2000d-1, and the DOJ in an exercise of this authority promulgated a regulation forbidding funding recipients to "utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin ... ." 28 CFR  42.104(b)(2) (1999). See also 49 CFR  21.5(b)(2) (2000) (similar DOT regulation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p3"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The State of Alabama amended its Constitution in 1990 to declare English "the official language of the state of Alabama." Amdt. 509. Pursuant to this provision and, petitioners have argued, to advance public safety, the Department decided to administer state driver's license examinations only in English. Respondent Sandoval, as representative of a class, brought suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama to enjoin the English-only policy, arguing that it violated the DOJ regulation because it had the effect of subjecting non-English speakers to discrimination based on their national origin. The District Court agreed. It enjoined the policy and ordered the Department to accommodate non-English speakers. Sandoval v. Hagan, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/almd/edbH/sandoval-v-hagan/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1234&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1998). Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which affirmed. Sandoval v. Hagan, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;197&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;484&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1999). Both courts rejected petitioners' argument that Title VI did not provide respondents a cause of action to enforce the regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p4"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We do not inquire here whether the DOJ regulation was authorized by 602, or whether the courts below were correct to hold that the English-only policy had the effect of discriminating on the basis of national origin. The petition for writ of certiorari raised, and we agreed to review, only the question posed in the first paragraph of this opinion: whether there is a private cause of action to enforce the regulation. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;530&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1305&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;II&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p5"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Although Title VI has often come to this Court, it is fair to say (indeed, perhaps an understatement) that our opinions have not eliminated all uncertainty regarding its commands. For purposes of the present case, however, it is clear from our decisions, from Congress's amendments of Title VI, and from the parties' concessions that three aspects of Title VI must be taken as given. First, private individuals may sue to enforce 601 of Title VI and obtain both injunctive relief and damages. In Cannon v. University of Chicago, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yHT/cannon-v-university-of-chicago/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;441&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;677&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1979), the Court held that a private right of action existed to enforce Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, as amended, 20 U.S.C.  1681 et seq. The reasoning of that decision embraced the existence of a private right to enforce Title VI as well. "Title IX," the Court noted, "was patterned after Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964." 441 U.S., at 694. And, "[i]n 1972 when Title IX was enacted, the [parallel] language in Title VI had already been construed as creating a private remedy." Id., at 696. That meant, the Court reasoned, that Congress had intended Title IX, like Title VI, to provide a private cause of action. Id., at 699, 703, 710-711. Congress has since ratified Cannon's holding. Section 1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 100 Stat. 1845, 42 U.S.C.  2000d-7, expressly abrogated States' sovereign immunity against suits brought in federal court to enforce Title VI and provided that in a suit against a State "remedies (including remedies both at law and in equity) are available ... to the same extent as such remedies are available ... in the suit against any public or private entity other than a State," 2000d-7(a)(2). We recognized in Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zv3/franklin-v-gwinnett-county-public-schools/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;503&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1992), that 2000d-7 "cannot be read except as a validation of Cannon's holding." Id., at 72; see also id., at 78 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (same). It is thus beyond dispute that private individuals may sue to enforce 601.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p6"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Second, it is similarly beyond dispute-and no party disagrees-that 601 prohibits only intentional discrimination. In Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yFm/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;438&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;265&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1978), the Court reviewed a decision of the California Supreme Court that had enjoined the University of California Medical School from "according any consideration to race in its admissions process." Id., at 272. Essential to the Court's holding reversing that aspect of the California court's decision was the determination that 601 "proscribe[s] only those racial classifications that would violate the Equal Protection Clause or the Fifth Amendment." Id., at 287 (opinion of Powell, J.); see also id., at 325, 328, 352 (opinion of Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.). In Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yZW/guardians-assn-v-civil-serv-commn-of-new-york-city/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;463&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;582&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1983), the Court made clear that under Bakke only intentional discrimination was forbidden by 601. 463 U.S., at 610-611 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 612 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 642 (Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting). What we said in Alexander v. Choate, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z5X/alexander-v-choate/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;469&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;287&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 293 (1985), is true today: "Title VI itself directly reach[es] only instances of intentional discrimination."&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p7"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Third, we must assume for purposes of deciding this case that regulations promulgated under 602 of Title VI may validly proscribe activities that have a disparate impact on racial groups, even though such activities are permissible under 601. Though no opinion of this Court has held that, five Justices in Guardians voiced that view of the law at least as alternative grounds for their decisions, see 463 U.S., at 591-592 (opinion of White, J.); id., at 623, n. 15 (Marshall, J., dissenting); id., at 643-645 (Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting), and dictum in Alexander v. Choate is to the same effect, see 469 U.S., at 293, 295, n. 11. These statements are in considerable tension with the rule of Bakke and Guardians that 601 forbids only intentional discrimination, see, e.g., Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, supra, at 612-613 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment), but petitioners have not challenged the regulations here. We therefore assume for the purposes of deciding this case that the DOJ and DOT regulations proscribing activities that have a disparate impact on the basis of race are valid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p8"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Respondents assert that the issue in this case, like the first two described above, has been resolved by our cases. To reject a private cause of action to enforce the disparate-impact regulations, they say, we would "[have] to ignore the actual language of Guardians and Cannon." Brief for Respondents 13. The language in Cannon to which respondents refer does not in fact support their position, as we shall discuss at length below, see infra, at 12-13. But in any event, this Court is bound by holdings, not language. Cannon was decided on the assumption that the University of Chicago had intentionally discriminated against petitioner. See 441 U.S., at 680 (noting that respondents "admitted arguendo" that petitioner's "application for admission to medical school was denied by the respondents because she is a woman"). It therefore held that Title IX created a private right of action to enforce its ban on intentional discrimination, but had no occasion to consider whether the right reached regulations barring disparate-impact discrimination.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; In Guardians, the Court held that private individuals could not recover compensatory damages under Title VI except for intentional discrimination. Five Justices in addition voted to uphold the disparate-impact regulations (four would have declared them invalid, see 463 U.S., at 611, n. 5 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 612-614 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)), but of those five, three expressly reserved the question of a direct private right of action to enforce the regulations, saying that "[w]hether a cause of action against private parties exists directly under the regulations ... [is a] questio[n] that [is] not presented by this case." Id., at 645, n. 18 (Stevens, J., dissenting).&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; Thus, only two Justices had cause to reach the issue that respondents say the "actual language" of Guardians resolves. Neither that case,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; nor any other in this Court, has held that the private right of action exists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p9"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Nor does it follow straightaway from the three points we have taken as given that Congress must have intended a private right of action to enforce disparate-impact regulations. We do not doubt that regulations applying 601's ban on intentional discrimination are covered by the cause of action to enforce that section. Such regulations, if valid and reasonable, authoritatively construe the statute itself, see NationsBank of N. C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B3B/nationsbank-of-nc-na-v-variable-annuity-life-ins-c/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;513&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;251&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 257 (1995); Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z4B/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-counci/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;467&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;837&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 843-844 (1984), and it is therefore meaningless to talk about a separate cause of action to enforce the regulations apart from the statute. A Congress that intends the statute to be enforced through a private cause of action intends the authoritative interpretation of the statute to be so enforced as well. The many cases that respondents say have "assumed" that a cause of action to enforce a statute includes one to enforce its regulations illustrate (to the extent that cases in which an issue was not presented can illustrate anything) only this point; each involved regulations of the type we have just described, as respondents conceded at oral argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. See National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/Ba2/national-collegiate-athletic-assn-v-smith/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;525&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;459&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 468 (1999) (regulation defining who is a "recipient" under Title IX); School Bd. of Nassau Cty. v. Arline, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zf9/school-bd-of-nassau-cty-v-arline/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;480&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;273&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 279-281 (1987) (regulations defining the terms "physical impairment" and "major life activities" in 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973); Bazemore v. Friday, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zdE/bazemore-v-friday/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;478&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;385&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 408-409 (1986) (White, J., joined by four other Justices, concurring) (regulation interpreting Title VI to require "affirmative action" remedying effects of intentional discrimination); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S., at 299, 309 (regulations clarifying what sorts of disparate impacts upon the handicapped were covered by 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which the Court assumed included some such impacts). Our decision in Lau v. Nichols, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ynL/lau-v-nichols/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;414&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;563&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1974), falls within the same category. The Title VI regulations at issue in Lau, similar to the ones at issue here, forbade funding recipients to take actions which had the effect of discriminating on the basis of race, color, or national origin. Id., at 568. Unlike our later cases, however, the Court in Lau interpreted 601 itself to proscribe disparate-impact discrimination, saying that it "rel[ied] solely on 601 ... to reverse the Court of Appeals," id., at 566, and that the disparate-impact regulations simply "[made] sure that recipients of federal aid ... conduct[ed] any federally financed projects consistently with 601," id., at 567.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="fn5_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p10"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We must face now the question avoided by Lau, because we have since rejected Lau's interpretation of 601 as reaching beyond intentional discrimination. See supra, at 4. It is clear now that the disparate-impact regulations do not simply apply 601-since they indeed forbid conduct that 601 permits-and therefore clear that the private right of action to enforce 601 does not include a private right to enforce these regulations. See Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B2F/central-bank-of-denver-na-v-first-interstate-bank-/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;511&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;164&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 173 (1994) (a "private plaintiff may not bring a [suit based on a regulation] against a defendant for acts not prohibited by the text of [the statute]"). That right must come, if at all, from the independent force of 602. As stated earlier, we assume for purposes of this decision that 602 confers the authority to promulgate disparate-impact regulations&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6" id="fn6_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;; the question remains whether it confers a private right of action to enforce them. If not, we must conclude that a failure to comply with regulations promulgated under 602 that is not also a failure to comply with 601 is not actionable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p11"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Implicit in our discussion thus far has been a particular understanding of the genesis of private causes of action. Like substantive federal law itself, private rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by Congress. Touche Ross &amp;amp; Co. v. Redington, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yJu/touche-ross-co-v-redington/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;442&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;560&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 578 (1979) (remedies available are those "that Congress enacted into law"). The judicial task is to interpret the statute Congress has passed to determine whether it displays an intent to create not just a private right but also a private remedy. Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yKd/transamerica-mortgage-advisors-inc-v-lewis/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;444&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 15 (1979). Statutory intent on this latter point is determinative. See, e.g., Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zud/virginia-bankshares-inc-v-sandberg/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;501&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1083&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 1102 (1991); Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zdS/merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc-v-thompson/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;478&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;804&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 812, n. 9 (1986) (collecting cases). Without it, a cause of action does not exist and courts may not create one, no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter, or how compatible with the statute. See, e.g., Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z9p/massachusetts-mut-life-ins-co-v-russell/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;473&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;134&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 145, 148 (1985); Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, supra, at 23; Touche Ross &amp;amp; Co. v. Redington, supra, at 575-576. "Raising up causes of action where a statute has not created them may be a proper function for common-law courts, but not for federal tribunals." Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp;amp; Petigrow v. Gilbertson, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ztS/lampf-pleva-lipkind-prupis-petigrow-v-gilbertson/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;501&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;350&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 365 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p12"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Respondents would have us revert in this case to the understanding of private causes of action that held sway 40 years ago when Title VI was enacted. That understanding is captured by the Court's statement in J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xLa/ji-case-co-v-borak/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;377&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;426&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 433 (1964), that "it is the duty of the courts to be alert to provide such remedies as are necessary to make effective the congressional purpose" expressed by a statute. We abandoned that understanding in Cort v. Ash, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yuf/cort-v-ash/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;422&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;66&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 78 (1975)-which itself interpreted a statute enacted under the ancien regime-and have not returned to it since. Not even when interpreting the same Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that was at issue in Borak have we applied Borak's method for discerning and defining causes of action. See Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., supra, at 188; Musick, Peeler &amp;amp; Garrett v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zy2/musick-peeler-garrett-v-employers-ins-of-wausau/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;508&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;286&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 291-293 (1993); Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, supra, at 1102-1103; Touche Ross &amp;amp; Co. v. Redington, supra, at 576-578. Having sworn off the habit of venturing beyond Congress's intent, we will not accept respondents' invitation to have one last drink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p13"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Nor do we agree with the Government that our cases interpreting statutes enacted prior to Cort v. Ash have given "dispositive weight" to the "expectations" that the enacting Congress had formed "in light of the 'contemporary legal context.' " Brief for United States 14. Only three of our legion implied-right-of-action cases have found this sort of "contemporary legal context" relevant, and two of those involved Congress's enactment (or reenactment) of the verbatim statutory text that courts had previously interpreted to create a private right of action. See Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp;amp; Smith, Inc. v. Curran, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yUD/merrill-lynch-pierce-fenner-smith-inc-v-curran/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;456&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;353&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 378-379 (1982); Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S., at 698-699. In the third case, this sort of "contemporary legal context" simply buttressed a conclusion independently supported by the text of the statute. See Thompson v. Thompson, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zhA/thompson-v-thompson/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;484&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;174&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1988). We have never accorded dispositive weight to context shorn of text. In determining whether statutes create private rights of action, as in interpreting statutes generally, see Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zu6/blatchford-v-native-village-of-noatak/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;501&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;775&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 784 (1991), legal context matters only to the extent it clarifies text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p14"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We therefore begin (and find that we can end) our search for Congress's intent with the text and structure of Title VI.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn7" id="fn7_ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; Section 602 authorizes federal agencies "to effectuate the provisions of [601] ... by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability." 42 U.S.C.  2000d-1. It is immediately clear that the "rights-creating" language so critical to the Court's analysis in Cannon of 601, see 441 U.S., at 690 n. 13, is completely absent from 602. Whereas 601 decrees that "[n]o person ... shall ... be subjected to discrimination," 42 U.S.C.  2000d the text of 602 provides that "[e]ach Federal department and agency ... is authorized and directed to effectuate the provisions of [601]," 42 U.S.C.  2000d-1. Far from displaying congressional intent to create new rights, 602 limits agencies to "effectuat[ing]" rights already created by 601. And the focus of 602 is twice removed from the individuals who will ultimately benefit from Title VI's protection. Statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than the individuals protected create "no implication of an intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons." California v. Sierra Club, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yQB/california-v-sierra-club/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;451&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;287&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 294 (1981). Section 602 is yet a step further removed: it focuses neither on the individuals protected nor even on the funding recipients being regulated, but on the agencies that will do the regulating. Like the statute found not to create a right of action in Universities Research Assn., Inc. v. Coutu, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yQb/universities-research-assn-inc-v-coutu/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;450&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;754&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1981), 602 is "phrased as a directive to federal agencies engaged in the distribution of public funds," id., at 772. When this is true, "[t]here [is] far less reason to infer a private remedy in favor of individual persons," Cannon v. University of Chicago, supra, at 690-691. So far as we can tell, this authorizing portion of 602 reveals no congressional intent to create a private right of action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p15"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Nor do the methods that 602 goes on to provide for enforcing its authorized regulations manifest an intent to create a private remedy; if anything, they suggest the opposite. Section 602 empowers agencies to enforce their regulations either by terminating funding to the "particular program, or part thereof," that has violated the regulation or "by any other means authorized by law," 42 U.S.C.  2000d-1. No enforcement action may be taken, however, "until the department or agency concerned has advised the appropriate person or persons of the failure to comply with the requirement and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means." Ibid. And every agency enforcement action is subject to judicial review. 2000d-2. If an agency attempts to terminate program funding, still more restrictions apply. The agency head must "file with the committees of the House and Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action." 2000d-1. And the termination of funding does not "become effective until thirty days have elapsed after the filing of such report." Ibid. Whatever these elaborate restrictions on agency enforcement may imply for the private enforcement of rights created outside of 602, compare Cannon v. University of Chicago, supra, at 706, n. 41, 712, n. 49; Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S., at 419, n. 26 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), with Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, 463 U.S., at 609-610 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment); Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, supra, at 382-383 (opinion of White, J.), they tend to contradict a congressional intent to create privately enforceable rights through 602 itself. The express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that Congress intended to preclude others. See, e.g., Karahalios v. Federal Employees, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zmJ/karahalios-v-federal-employees/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;489&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;527&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 533 (1989); Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yQu/northwest-airlines-inc-v-transport-workers/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;451&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;77&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 93-94 (1981); Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U.S., at 19-20. Sometimes the suggestion is so strong that it precludes a finding of congressional intent to create a private right of action, even though other aspects of the statute (such as language making the would-be plaintiff "a member of the class for whose benefit the statute was enacted") suggest the contrary. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S., at 145; see id., at 146-147. And as our Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U.S.C.  1983 cases show, some remedial schemes foreclose a private cause of action to enforce even those statutes that admittedly create substantive private rights. See, e.g., Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Assn., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yRY/middlesex-county-sewerage-authority-v-national-sea/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;453&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 19-20 (1981). In the present case, the claim of exclusivity for the express remedial scheme does not even have to overcome such obstacles. The question whether 602's remedial scheme can overbear other evidence of congressional intent is simply not presented, since we have found no evidence anywhere in the text to suggest that Congress intended to create a private right to enforce regulations promulgated under 602.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p16"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Both the Government and respondents argue that the regulations contain rights-creating language and so must be privately enforceable, see Brief for United States 19-20; Brief for Respondents 31, but that argument skips an analytical step. Language in a regulation may invoke a private right of action that Congress through statutory text created, but it may not create a right that Congress has not. Touche Ross &amp;amp; Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S., at 577, n. 18 ("[T]he language of the statute and not the rules must control"). Thus, when a statute has provided a general authorization for private enforcement of regulations, it may perhaps be correct that the intent displayed in each regulation can determine whether or not it is privately enforceable. But it is most certainly incorrect to say that language in a regulation can conjure up a private cause of action that has not been authorized by Congress. Agencies may play the sorcerer's apprentice but not the sorcerer himself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p17"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The last string to respondents' and the Government's bow is their argument that two amendments to Title VI "ratified" this Court's decisions finding an implied private right of action to enforce the disparate-impact regulations. See Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 1003, 42 U.S.C.  2000d-7; Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, 6, 102 Stat. 31, 42 U.S.C.  2000d-4a. One problem with this argument is that, as explained above, none of our decisions establishes (or even assumes) the private right of action at issue here, see supra, at 5-8, which is why in Guardians three Justices were able expressly to reserve the question. See 463 U.S., at 645, n. 18 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Incorporating our cases in the amendments would thus not help respondents. Another problem is that the incorporation claim itself is flawed. Section 1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, on which only respondents rely, by its terms applies only to suits "for a violation of a statute," 42 U.S.C.  2000d-7(a)(2) (emphasis added). It therefore does not speak to suits for violations of regulations that go beyond the statutory proscription of 601. Section 6 of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 is even less on point. That provision amends Title VI to make the term "program or activity" cover larger portions of the institutions receiving federal financial aid than it had previously covered, see Grove City College v.

It is impossible to understand what this has to do with implied causes of action-which is why we declared in Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S., at 73, that 6 did not "in any way alte[r] the existing rights of action and the corresponding remedies permissible under ... Title VI." Respondents point to Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp;amp; Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U.S., at 381-382, which inferred congressional intent to ratify lower court decisions regarding a particular statutory provision when Congress comprehensively revised the statutory scheme but did not amend that provision. But we recently criticized Curran's reliance on congressional inaction, saying that "[a]s a general matter ... [the] argumen[t] deserve[s] little weight in the interpretive process." Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U.S., at 187. And when, as here, Congress has not comprehensively revised a statutory scheme but has made only isolated amendments, we have spoken more bluntly: "It is 'impossible to assert with any degree of assurance that congressional failure to act represents' affirmative congressional approval of the Court's statutory interpretation." Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zo9/patterson-v-mclean-credit-union/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;491&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;164&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 175, n. 1 (1989) (quoting Johnson v.

      &lt;p&gt;Neither as originally enacted nor as later amended does Title VI display an intent to create a freestanding private right of action to enforce regulations promulgated under 602.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn8" id="fn8_ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; We therefore hold that no such right of action exists. Since we reach this conclusion applying our standard test for discerning private causes of action, we do not address petitioners' additional argument that implied causes of action against States (and perhaps nonfederal state actors generally) are inconsistent with the clear statement rule of Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yQs/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;451&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1981).

        &lt;p&gt; Although the dissent acknowledges that "the breadth of [Cannon's] precedent is a matter upon which reasonable jurists may differ," post, at 21, it disagrees with our reading of Cannon's holding because it thinks the distinction we draw between disparate-impact and intentional discrimination was "wholly foreign" to that opinion, see post, at 5. Cannon, however, was decided less than one year after the Court in Bakke had drawn precisely that distinction with respect to Title VI, see supra, at 4, and it is absurd to think that Cannon meant, without discussion, to ban under Title IX the very disparate-impact discrimination that Bakke said Title VI permitted. The only discussion in Cannon of Title IX's scope is found in Justice Powell's dissenting opinion, which simply assumed that the conclusion that Title IX would be limited to intentional discrimination was "forgone in light of our holding" in Bakke. Cannon v. University of Chicago, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yHT/cannon-v-university-of-chicago/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;441&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;677&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 748, n. 19 (1979). The dissent's additional claim that Cannon provided a private right of action for "all the discrimination prohibited by the regulatory scheme contained in Title IX," post, at 5, n. 4 (emphasis added), simply begs the question at the heart of this case, which is whether a right of action to enforce disparate-impact regulations must be independently identified, see infra, at 7-10.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn3"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; We of course accept the statement by the author of the dissent that he "thought" at the time of Guardians that disparate-impact regulations could be enforced "in an implied action against private parties," post, at 9, n. 6. But we have the better interpretation of what our colleague wrote in Guardians. In the closing section of his opinion, Justice Stevens concluded that because respondents in that case had "violated the petitioners' rights under [the] regulations ... [t]he petitioners were therefore entitled to the compensation they sought under 42 U.S.C.  1983 and were awarded by the District Court." 463 U.S., at 645. The passage omits any mention of a direct private right of action to enforce the regulations, and the footnote we have quoted in text-which appears immediately after this concluding sentence, see id., at 645, n. 18-makes clear that the omission was not accidental.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn4"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Ultimately, the dissent agrees that "the holding in Guardians does not compel the conclusion that a private right of action exists to enforce the Title VI regulations against private parties ... ." Post, at 9.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn5"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; It is true, as the dissent points out, see post, at 3-4, that three Justices who concurred in the result in Lau relied on regulations promulgated under 602 to support their position, see Lau v. Nichols, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ynL/lau-v-nichols/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;414&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;563&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 570-571 (1974) (Stewart, J., concurring in result). But the five Justices who made up the majority did not, and their holding is not made coextensive with the concurrence because their opinion does not expressly preclude (is "consistent with," see post, at 4) the concurrence's approach. The Court would be in an odd predicament if a concurring minority of the Justices could force the majority to address a point they found it unnecessary (and did not wish) to address, under compulsion of Justice Stevens' new principle that silence implies agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn6"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; For this reason, the dissent's extended discussion of the scope of agencies' regulatory authority under 602, see post, at 13-15, is beside the point. We cannot help observing, however, how strange it is to say that disparate-impact regulations are "inspired by, at the service of, and inseparably intertwined with" 601, post, at 15, when 601 permits the very behavior that the regulations forbid. See Guardians, 463 U.S., at 613 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) ("If, as five members of the Court concluded in Bakke, the purpose of Title VI is to proscribe only purposeful discrimination ... , regulations that would proscribe conduct by the recipient having only a discriminatory effect ... do not simply 'further' the purpose of Title VI; they go well beyond that purpose").&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn7"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn7_ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Although the dissent claims that we "adop[t] a methodology that blinds itself to important evidence of congressional intent," see post, at 21, our methodology is not novel, but well established in earlier decisions (including one authored by Justice Stevens, see Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yQu/northwest-airlines-inc-v-transport-workers/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;451&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;77&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 94, n. 31 (1981)), which explain that the interpretive inquiry begins with the text and structure of the statute, see id., at 91, and ends once it has become clear that Congress did not provide a cause of action.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn8"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn8_ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The dissent complains that we "offe[r] little affirmative support" for this conclusion. Post, at 24. But as Justice Stevens has previously recognized in an opinion for the Court, "affirmative" evidence of congressional intent must be provided for an implied remedy, not against it, for without such intent "the essential predicate for implication of a private remedy simply does not exist," Northwest Airlines, Inc., 451 U.S., at 94. The dissent's assertion that "petitioners have marshaled substantial affirmative evidence that a private right of action exists to enforce Title VI and the regulations validly promulgated thereunder," post, at 24-25, n. 26 (second emphasis added), once again begs the question whether authorization of a private right of action to enforce a statute constitutes authorization of a private right of action to enforce regulations that go beyond what the statute itself requires.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stevens, J., dissenting&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p21"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p22"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In 1964, as part of a groundbreaking and comprehensive civil rights Act, Congress prohibited recipients of federal funds from discriminating on the basis of race, ethnicity, or national origin. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, 42 U.S.C.  2000d to 2000d-7. Pursuant to powers expressly delegated by that Act, the federal agencies and departments responsible for awarding and administering federal contracts immediately adopted regulations prohibiting federal contractees from adopting policies that have the "effect" of discriminating on those bases. At the time of the promulgation of these regulations, prevailing principles of statutory construction assumed that Congress intended a private right of action whenever such a cause of action was necessary to protect individual rights granted by valid federal law. Relying both on this presumption and on independent analysis of Title VI, this Court has repeatedly and consistently affirmed the right of private individuals to bring civil suits to enforce rights guaranteed by Title VI. A fair reading of those cases, and coherent implementation of the statutory scheme, requires the same result under Title VI's implementing regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p23"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In separate lawsuits spanning several decades, we have endorsed an action identical in substance to the one brought in this case, see Lau v. Nichols, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ynL/lau-v-nichols/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;414&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;563&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1974); demonstrated that Congress intended a private right of action to protect the rights guaranteed by Title VI, see Cannon v. University of Chicago, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yHT/cannon-v-university-of-chicago/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;441&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;677&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1979); and concluded that private individuals may seek declaratory and injunctive relief against state officials for violations of regulations promulgated pursuant to Title VI, see Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yZW/guardians-assn-v-civil-serv-commn-of-new-york-city/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;463&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;582&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1983). Giving fair import to our language and our holdings, every Court of Appeals to address the question has concluded that a private right of action exists to enforce the rights guaranteed both by the text of Title VI and by any regulations validly promulgated pursuant to that Title, and Congress has adopted several statutes that appear to ratify the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p24"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Today, in a decision unfounded in our precedent and hostile to decades of settled expectations, a majority of this Court carves out an important exception to the right of private action long recognized under Title VI. In so doing, the Court makes three distinct, albeit interrelated, errors. First, the Court provides a muddled account of both the reasoning and the breadth of our prior decisions endorsing a private right of action under Title VI, thereby obscuring the conflict between those opinions and today's decision. Second, the Court offers a flawed and unconvincing analysis of the relationship between 601 and 602 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, ignoring more plausible and persuasive explanations detailed in our prior opinions. Finally, the Court badly misconstrues the theoretical linchpin of our decision in Cannon v. University of Chicago, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yHT/cannon-v-university-of-chicago/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;441&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;677&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1979), mistaking that decision's careful contextual analysis for judicial fiat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p25"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;* The majority is undoubtedly correct that this Court has never said in so many words that a private right of action exists to enforce the disparate-impact regulations promulgated under 602. However, the failure of our cases to state this conclusion explicitly does not absolve the Court of the responsibility to canvass our prior opinions for guidance. Reviewing these opinions with the care they deserve, I reach the same conclusion as the Courts of Appeals: This Court has already considered the question presented today and concluded that a private right of action exists.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1-1" id="fn1-1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p26"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When this Court faced an identical case 27 years ago, all the Justices believed that private parties could bring lawsuits under Title VI and its implementing regulations to enjoin the provision of governmental services in a manner that discriminated against non-English speakers. See Lau v. Nichols, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ynL/lau-v-nichols/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;414&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;563&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1974). While five Justices saw no need to go beyond the command of 601, Chief Justice Burger, Justice Stewart, and Justice Blackmun relied specifically and exclusively on the regulations to support the private action, see id., at 569 (Stewart, J., concurring in result) (citing Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ykh/mourning-v-family-publications-service-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;411&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;356&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 369 (1973); Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/y3S/thorpe-v-housing-authority-of-durham/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;393&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;268&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 280-281 (1969)). There is nothing in the majority's opinion in Lau, or in earlier opinions of the Court, that is not fully consistent with the analysis of the concurring Justices or that would have differentiated between private actions to enforce the text of 601 and private actions to enforce the regulations promulgated pursuant to 602. See Guardians, 463 U.S., at 591 (principal opinion of White, J.) (describing this history and noting that, up to that point, no Justice had ever expressed disagreement with Justice Stewart's analysis in Lau).&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2-1" id="fn2-1_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p27"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Five years later, we more explicitly considered whether a private right of action exists to enforce the guarantees of Title VI and its gender-based twin, Title IX. See Cannon v. University of Chicago, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yHT/cannon-v-university-of-chicago/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;441&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;677&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1979). In that case, we examined the text of the statutes, analyzed the purpose of the laws, and canvassed the relevant legislative history. Our conclusion was unequivocal: "We have no doubt that Congress intended to create Title IX remedies comparable to those available under Title VI and that it understood Title VI as authorizing an implied private cause of action for victims of the prohibited discrimination." Id., at 703.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p28"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The majority acknowledges that Cannon is binding precedent with regard to both Title VI and Title IX, ante, at 3-4, but seeks to limit the scope of its holding to cases involving allegations of intentional discrimination. The distinction the majority attempts to impose is wholly foreign to Cannon's text and reasoning. The opinion in Cannon consistently treats the question presented in that case as whether a private right of action exists to enforce "Title IX" (and by extension "Title VI"),&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3-1" id="fn3-1_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; and does not draw any distinctions between the various types of discrimination outlawed by the operation of those statutes. Though the opinion did not reach out to affirmatively preclude the drawing of every conceivable distinction, it could hardly have been more clear as to the scope of its holding: A private right of action exists for "victims of the prohibited discrimination." 441 U.S., at 703 (emphasis added). Not some of the prohibited discrimination, but all of it.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4-1" id="fn4-1_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p29"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Moreover, Cannon was itself a disparate-impact case. In that case, the plaintiff brought suit against two private universities challenging medical school admissions policies that set age limits for applicants. Plaintiff, a 39-year-old woman, alleged that these rules had the effect of discriminating against women because the incidence of interrupted higher education is higher among women than among men. In providing a shorthand description of her claim in the text of the opinion, we ambiguously stated that she had alleged that she was denied admission "because she is a woman," but we appended a lengthy footnote setting forth the details of her disparate-impact claim. Other than the shorthand description of her claim, there is not a word in the text of the opinion even suggesting that she had made the improbable allegation that the University of Chicago and Northwestern University had intentionally discriminated against women. In the context of the entire opinion (including both its analysis and its uncontested description of the facts of the case), that single ambiguous phrase provides no basis for limiting the case's holding to incidents of intentional discrimination. If anything, the fact that the phrase "because she is a woman" encompasses both intentional and disparate-impact claims should have made it clear that the reasoning in the opinion was equally applicable to both types of claims. In any event, the holding of the case certainly applied to the disparate-impact claim that was described in detail in footnote 1 of the opinion, id., at 680.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p30"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our fractured decision in Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yZW/guardians-assn-v-civil-serv-commn-of-new-york-city/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;463&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;582&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1983), reinforces the conclusion that this issue is effectively settled. While the various opinions in that case took different views as to the spectrum of relief available to plaintiffs in Title VI cases, a clear majority of the Court expressly stated that private parties may seek injunctive relief against governmental practices that have the effect of discriminating against racial and ethnic minorities. Id., at 594-595, 607 (White, J.); id., at 634 (Marshall, J., dissenting); id., at 638 (Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting). As this case involves just such an action, its result ought to follow naturally from Guardians.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p31"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As I read today's opinion, the majority declines to accord precedential value to Guardians because the five Justices in the majority were arguably divided over the mechanism through which private parties might seek such injunctive relief.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5-1" id="fn5-1_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; This argument inspires two responses. First, to the extent that the majority denies relief to the respondents merely because they neglected to mention 42 U.S.C.  1983 in framing their Title VI claim, this case is something of a sport. Litigants who in the future wish to enforce the Title VI regulations against state actors in all likelihood must only reference 1983 to obtain relief; indeed, the plaintiffs in this case (or other similarly situated individuals) presumably retain the option of re-challenging Alabama's English-only policy in a complaint that invokes 1983 even after today's decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p32"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;More important, the majority's reading of Guardians is strained even in reference to the broader question whether injunctive relief is available to remedy violations of the Title VI regulations by nongovernmental grantees. As Guardians involved an action against a governmental entity, making 1983 relief available, the Court might have discussed the availability of judicial relief without addressing the scope of the implied private right of action available directly under Title VI. See 463 U. S., at 638 (Stevens, J.) ("Even if it were not settled by now that Title VI authorizes appropriate relief, both prospective and retroactive, to victims of racial discrimination at the hands of recipients of federal funds, the same result would follow in this case because the petitioners have sought relief under 42 U.S.C.  1983" (emphasis deleted)). However, the analysis in each of the relevant opinions did not do so.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6-1" id="fn6-1_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; Rather than focusing on considerations specific to 1983, each of these opinions looked instead to our opinion in Cannon, to the intent of the Congress that adopted Title VI and the contemporaneous executive decisionmakers who crafted the Disparate-impact regulations, and to general principles of remediation.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn7-1" id="fn7-1_ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p33"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In summary, there is clear precedent of this Court for the proposition that the plaintiffs in this case can seek injunctive relief either through an implied right of action or through 1983. Though the holding in Guardians does not compel the conclusion that a private right of action exists to enforce the Title VI regulations against private parties, the rationales of the relevant opinions strongly imply that result. When that fact is coupled with our holding in Cannon and our unanimous decision in Lau, the answer to the question presented in this case is overdetermined.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn8-1" id="fn8-1_ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; Even absent my continued belief that Congress intended a private right of action to enforce both Title VI and its implementing regulations, I would answer the question presented in the affirmative and affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals as a matter of stare decisis.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn9" id="fn9_ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;II&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p34"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Underlying the majority's dismissive treatment of our prior cases is a flawed understanding of the structure of Title VI and, more particularly, of the relationship between 601 and 602. To some extent, confusion as to the relationship between the provisions is understandable, as Title VI is a deceptively simple statute. Section 601 of the Act lays out its straightforward commitment: "No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." 42 U.S.C.  2000d. Section 602 "authorize[s] and direct[s]" all federal departments and agencies empowered to extend federal financial assistance to issue "rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability" in order to "effectuate" 601's antidiscrimination mandate. 42 U.S.C.  2000d-1.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn10" id="fn10_ref"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p35"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;On the surface, the relationship between 601 and 602 is unproblematic-601 states a basic principle, 602 authorizes agencies to develop detailed plans for defining the contours of the principle and ensuring its enforcement. In the context of federal civil rights law, however, nothing is ever so simple. As actions to enforce 601's antidiscrimination principle have worked their way through the courts, we have developed a body of law giving content to 601's broadly worded commitment. E.g., United States v. Fordice, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zww/united-states-v-fordice/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;505&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;717&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 732, n. 7 (1992); Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yZW/guardians-assn-v-civil-serv-commn-of-new-york-city/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;463&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;582&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1983); Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yFm/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;438&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;265&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1978). As the majority emphasizes today, the Judiciary's understanding of what conduct may be remedied in actions brought directly under 601 is, in certain ways, more circumscribed than the conduct prohibited by the regulations. See, e.g., ante, at 5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p36"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;36&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Given that seeming peculiarity, it is necessary to examine closely the relationship between 601 and 602, in order to understand the purpose and import of the regulations at issue in this case. For the most part, however, the majority ignores this task, assuming that the judicial decisions interpreting 601 provide an authoritative interpretation of its true meaning and treating the regulations promulgated by the agencies charged with administering the statute as poor step-cousins-either parroting the text of 601 (in the case of regulations that prohibit intentional discrimination) or forwarding an agenda untethered to 601's mandate (in the case of disparate-impact regulations).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p37"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;37&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The majority's statutory analysis does violence to both the text and the structure of Title VI. Section 601 does not stand in isolation, but rather as part of an integrated remedial scheme. Section 602 exists for the sole purpose of forwarding the antidiscrimination ideals laid out in 601.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn11" id="fn11_ref"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt; The majority's persistent belief that the two sections somehow forward different agendas finds no support in the statute. Nor does Title VI anywhere suggest, let alone state, that for the purpose of determining their legal effect, the "rules, regulations, [and] orders of general applicability" adopted by the agencies are to be bifurcated by the judiciary into two categories based on how closely the courts believe the regulations track the text of 601.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p38"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;38&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What makes the Court's analysis even more troubling is that our cases have already adopted a simpler and more sensible model for understanding the relationship between the two sections. For three decades, we have treated 602 as granting the responsible agencies the power to issue broad prophylactic rules aimed at realizing the vision laid out in 601, even if the conduct captured by these rules is at times broader than that which would otherwise be prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p39"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;39&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In Lau, our first Title VI case, the only three Justices whose understanding of 601 required them to reach the question explicitly endorsed the power of the agencies to adopt broad prophylactic rules to enforce the aims of the statute. As Justice Stewart explained, regulations promulgated pursuant to 602 may "go beyond . . . 601" as long as they are "reasonably related" to its antidiscrimination mandate. 414 U.S., at 571 (Stewart, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Blackmun, J., concurring in result). In Guardians, at least three Members of the Court adopted a similar understanding of the statute. See 463 U.S., at 643 (Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting). Finally, just 16 years ago, our unanimous opinion in Alexander v. Choate, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z5X/alexander-v-choate/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;469&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;287&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1985), treated this understanding of Title VI's structure as settled law. Writing for the Court, Justice Marshall aptly explained the interpretation of 602's grant of regulatory power that necessarily underlies our prior caselaw: "In essence, then, we [have] held that Title VI [has] delegated to the agencies in the first instance the complex determination of what sorts of disparate impacts upon minorities constituted sufficiently significant social problems, and [are] readily enough remediable, to warrant altering the practices of the federal grantees that ha[ve] produced those impacts." Id., at 293- 294.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p40"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This understanding is firmly rooted in the text of Title VI. As 602 explicitly states, the agencies are authorized to adopt regulations to "effectuate" 601's antidiscrimination mandate. 42 U.S.C.  2000d-1. The plain meaning of the text reveals Congress' intent to provide the relevant agencies with sufficient authority to transform the statute's broad aspiration into social reality. So too does a lengthy, consistent, and impassioned legislative history.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn12" id="fn12_ref"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p41"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;41&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This legislative design reflects a reasonable-indeed inspired-model for attacking the often-intractable problem of racial and ethnic discrimination. On its own terms, the statute supports an action challenging policies of federal grantees that explicitly or unambiguously violate antidiscrimination norms (such as policies that on their face limit benefits or services to certain races). With regard to more subtle forms of discrimination (such as schemes that limit benefits or services on ostensibly race-neutral grounds but have the predictable and perhaps intended consequence of materially benefiting some races at the expense of others), the statute does not establish a static approach but instead empowers the relevant agencies to evaluate social circumstances to determine whether there is a need for stronger measures.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn13" id="fn13_ref"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; Such an approach builds into the law flexibility, an ability to make nuanced assessments of complex social realities, and an admirable willingness to credit the possibility of progress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p42"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The "effects" regulations at issue in this case represent the considered judgment of the relevant agencies that discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, and national origin by federal contractees are significant social problems that might be remedied, or at least ameliorated, by the application of a broad prophylactic rule. Given the judgment underlying them, the regulations are inspired by, at the service of, and inseparably intertwined with 601's antidiscrimination mandate. Contrary to the majority's suggestion, they "appl[y]" 601's prohibition on discrimination just as surely as the intentional discrimination regulations the majority concedes are privately enforceable. Ante, at 7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p43"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;43&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To the extent that our prior cases mischaracterize the relationship between 601 and 602, they err on the side of underestimating, not overestimating, the connection between the two provisions. While our cases have explicitly adopted an understanding of 601's scope that is somewhat narrower than the reach of the regulations,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn14" id="fn14_ref"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt; they have done so in an unorthodox and somewhat haphazard fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p44"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;44&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our conclusion that the legislation only encompasses intentional discrimination was never the subject of thorough consideration by a Court focused on that question. In Bakke, five Members of this Court concluded that 601 only prohibits race-based affirmative action programs in situations where the Equal Protection Clause would impose a similar ban. 438 U.S., at 287 (principal opinion of Powell, J.); id., at 325, 328, 352 (Brennan, J., joined by White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn15" id="fn15_ref"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt; In Guardians, the majority of the Court held that the analysis of those five Justices in Bakke compelled as a matter of stare decisis the conclusion that 601 does not on its own terms reach disparate impact cases. 463 U.S., at 610-611 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 612 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 642 (Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ.). However, the opinions adopting that conclusion did not engage in any independent analysis of the reach of 601. Indeed, the only writing on this subject came from two of the five Members of the Bakke "majority," each of whom wrote separately to reject the remaining Justices' understanding of their opinions in Bakke and to insist that 601 does in fact reach some instances of unintentional discrimination. 463 U.S., at 589-590 (White, J.); id., at 623-624 (Marshall, J., dissenting).&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn16" id="fn16_ref"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt; The Court's occasional rote invocation of this Guardians majority in later cases ought not obscure the fact that the question whether 601 applies to disparate-impact claims has never been analyzed by this Court on the merits.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn17" id="fn17_ref"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p45"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;45&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In addition, these Title VI cases seemingly ignore the well-established principle of administrative law that is now most often described as the "Chevron doctrine." See Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z4B/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-counci/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;467&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;837&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1984). In most other contexts, when the agencies charged with administering a broadly-worded statute offer regulations interpreting that statute or giving concrete guidance as to its implementation, we treat their interpretation of the statute's breadth as controlling unless it presents an unreasonable construction of the statutory text. See ibid. While there may be some dispute as to the boundaries of Chevron deference, see, e.g., Christensen v. Harris County, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/BbJ/christensen-v-harris-county/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;529&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;576&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (2000), it is paradigmatically appropriate when Congress has clearly delegated agencies the power to issue regulations with the force of law and established formal procedures for the promulgation of such regulations.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn18" id="fn18_ref"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p46"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;46&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If we were writing on a blank slate, we might very well conclude that Chevron and similar cases decided both before and after Guardians provide the proper framework for understanding the structure of Title VI. Under such a reading there would be no incongruity between 601 and 602. Instead, we would read 602 as granting the federal agencies responsible for distributing federal funds the authority to issue regulations interpreting 601 on the assumption that their construction will-if reasonable-be incorporated into our understanding of 601's meaning.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn19" id="fn19_ref"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p47"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;47&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To resolve this case, however, it is unnecessary to answer the question whether our cases interpreting the reach of 601 should be reinterpreted in light of Chevron. If one understands the relationship between 601 and 602 through the prism of either Chevron or our prior Title VI cases, the question presented all but answers itself. If the regulations promulgated pursuant to 602 are either an authoritative construction of 601's meaning or prophylactic rules necessary to actualize the goals enunciated in 601, then it makes no sense to differentiate between private actions to enforce 601 and private actions to enforce 602. There is but one private action to enforce Title VI, and we already know that such an action exists.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn20" id="fn20_ref"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; See Cannon, 441 U.S., at 703.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;III&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p48"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;48&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The majority couples its flawed analysis of the structure of Title VI with an uncharitable understanding of the substance of the divide between those on this Court who are reluctant to interpret statutes to allow for private rights of action and those who are willing to do so if the claim of right survives a rigorous application of the criteria set forth in Cort v. Ash, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yuf/cort-v-ash/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;422&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;66&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1975). As the majority narrates our implied right of action jurisprudence, ante, at 10-11, the Court's shift to a more skeptical approach represents the rejection of a common-law judicial activism in favor of a principled recognition of the limited role of a contemporary "federal tribunal." Ante, at 10. According to its analysis, the recognition of an implied right of action when the text and structure of the statute do not absolutely compel such a conclusion is an act of judicial self-indulgence. As much as we would like to help those disadvantaged by discrimination, we must resist the temptation to pour ourselves "one last drink." Ante, at 11. To do otherwise would be to "ventur[e] beyond Congress's intent." Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p49"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;49&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Overwrought imagery aside, it is the majority's approach that blinds itself to congressional intent. While it remains true that, if Congress intends a private right of action to support statutory rights, "the far better course is for it to specify as much when it creates those rights," Cannon, 441 U.S., at 717, its failure to do so does not absolve us of the responsibility to endeavor to discern its intent. In a series of cases since Cort v. Ash, we have laid out rules and developed strategies for this task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p50"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The very existence of these rules and strategies assumes that we will sometimes find manifestations of an implicit intent to create such a right. Our decision in Cannon represents one such occasion. As the Cannon opinion iterated and reiterated, the question whether the plaintiff had a right of action that could be asserted in federal court was a "question of statutory construction," 441 U. S, at 688, see also id., at 717 (Rehnquist, J., concurring), not a question of policy for the Court to decide. Applying the Cort v. Ash factors, we examined the nature of the rights at issue, the text and structure of the statute, and the relevant legislative history.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn21" id="fn21_ref"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt; Our conclusion was that Congress unmistakably intended a private right of action to enforce both Title IX and Title VI. Our reasoning-and, as I have demonstrated, our holding-was equally applicable to intentional discrimination and disparate impact claims.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn22" id="fn22_ref"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p51"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;51&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Underlying today's opinion is the conviction that Cannon must be cabined because it exemplifies an "expansive rights-creating approach." Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zv3/franklin-v-gwinnett-county-public-schools/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;503&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 77 (1992) (Scalia, J. concurring in judgment). But, as I have taken pains to explain, it was Congress, not the Court, that created the cause of action, and it was the Congress that later ratified the Cannon holding in 1986 and again in 1988. See 503 U.S., at 72-73.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p52"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;52&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In order to impose its own preferences as to the availability of judicial remedies, the Court today adopts a methodology that blinds itself to important evidence of congressional intent. It is one thing for the Court to ignore the import of our holding in Cannon, as the breadth of that precedent is a matter upon which reasonable jurists may differ. It is entirely another thing for the majority to ignore the reasoning of that opinion and the evidence contained therein, as those arguments and that evidence speak directly to the question at issue today. As I stated above, see n. 21, supra, Cannon carefully explained that both Title VI and Title IX were intended to benefit a particular class of individuals, that the purposes of the statutes would be furthered rather than frustrated by the implication of a private right of action, and that the legislative histories of the statutes support the conclusion that Congress intended such a right. See also Part IV, infra. Those conclusions and the evidence supporting them continue to have force today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p53"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Similarly, if the majority is genuinely committed to deciphering congressional intent, its unwillingness to even consider evidence as to the context in which Congress legislated is perplexing. Congress does not legislate in a vacuum. As the respondent and the Government suggest, and as we have held several times, the objective manifestations of congressional intent to create a private right of action must be measured in light of the enacting Congress' expectations as to how the judiciary might evaluate the question.

      &lt;p&gt;At the time Congress was considering Title VI, it was normal practice for the courts to infer that Congress intended a private right of action whenever it passed a statute designed to protect a particular class that did not contain enforcement mechanisms which would be thwarted by a private remedy. See Merrill Lynch, 456 U.S., at 374-375 (discussing this history). Indeed, the very year Congress adopted Title VI, this Court specifically stated that "it is the duty of the courts to be alert to provide such remedies as are necessary to make effective the congressional purpose." J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xLa/ji-case-co-v-borak/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;377&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;426&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 433 (1964). Assuming, as we must, that Congress was fully informed as to the state of the law, the contemporary context presents important evidence as to Congress' intent-evidence the majority declines to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p55"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;55&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, respect for Congress' prerogatives is measured in deeds, not words. Today, the Court coins a new rule, holding that a private cause of action to enforce a statute does not encompass a substantive regulation issued to effectuate that statute unless the regulation does nothing more than "authoritatively construe the statute itself." Ante, at 7.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn24" id="fn24_ref"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt; This rule might be proper if we were the kind of "common-law court" the majority decries, ante, at 10, inventing private rights of action never intended by Congress. For if we are not construing a statute, we certainly may refuse to create a remedy for violations of federal regulations. But if we are faithful to the commitment to discerning congressional intent that all Members of this Court profess, the distinction is untenable. There is simply no reason to assume that Congress contemplated, desired, or adopted a distinction between regulations that merely parrot statutory text and broader regulations that are authorized by statutory text.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn25" id="fn25_ref"&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IV&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p56"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;56&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Beyond its flawed structural analysis of Title VI and an evident antipathy toward implied rights of action, the majority offers little affirmative support for its conclusion that Congress did not intend to create a private remedy for violations of the Title VI regulations.26 The Court offers essentially two reasons for its position. First, it attaches significance to the fact that the "rights-creating" language in 601 that defines the classes protected by the statute is not repeated in 602. Ante, at 13-14. But, of course, there was no reason to put that language in 602 because it is perfectly obvious that the regulations authorized by 602 must be designed to protect precisely the same people protected by 601. Moreover, it is self-evident that, linguistic niceties notwithstanding, any statutory provision whose stated purpose is to "effectuate" the eradication of racial and ethnic discrimination has as its "focus" those individuals who, absent such legislation, would be subject to discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p57"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;57&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Second, the Court repeats the argument advanced and rejected in Cannon that the express provision of a fund cut-off remedy "suggests that Congress intended to preclude others." Ante, at 14. In Cannon, 441 U.S., at 704-708, we carefully explained why the presence of an explicit mechanism to achieve one of the statute's objectives (ensuring that federal funds are not used "to support discriminatory practices") does not preclude a conclusion that a private right of action was intended to achieve the statute's other principal objective ("to provide individual citizens effective protection against those practices"). In support of our analysis, we offered policy arguments, cited evidence from the legislative history, and noted the active support of the relevant agencies. Ibid. In today's decision, the Court does not grapple with-indeed, barely acknowledges-our rejection of this argument in Cannon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p58"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;58&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Like much else in its opinion, the present majority's unwillingness to explain its refusal to find the reasoning in Cannon persuasive suggests that today's decision is the unconscious product of the majority's profound distaste for implied causes of action rather than an attempt to discern the intent of the Congress that enacted Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Its colorful disclaimer of any interest in "venturing beyond Congress's intent," ante, at 11, has a hollow ring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;59&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The question the Court answers today was only an open question in the most technical sense. Given the prevailing consensus in the Courts of Appeals, the Court should have declined to take this case. Having granted certiorari, the Court should have answered the question differently by simply according respect to our prior decisions. But most importantly, even if it were to ignore all of our post-1964 writing, the Court should have answered the question differently on the merits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; Indeed, it would have been remarkable if the majority had offered any disagreement with the concurring analysis as the concurring Justices grounded their argument in well&amp;amp;nbhyph;established principles for determining the availability of remedies under regulations, principles that all but one Member of the Court had endorsed the previous Term. See Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ykh/mourning-v-family-publications-service-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;411&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;356&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 369 (1973); id., at 378 (Douglas, J., joined by Stewart and Rehnquist, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (agreeing with the majority's analysis of the regulation in question); but see id., at 383, n. 1 (Powell, J., dissenting) (reserving analysis of the regulation's validity). The other decision the concurring Justices cited for this well-established principle was unanimous and only five years old. See Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/y3S/thorpe-v-housing-authority-of-durham/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;393&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;268&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1969).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn3-1"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; See Cannon, 441 U.S., at 687, 699, 702, n. 33, 703, 706, n. 40, 709.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4-1_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The majority is undoubtedly correct that Cannon was not a case about the substance of Title IX but rather about the remedies available under that statute. Therefore, Cannon can not stand as a precedent for the proposition either that Title IX and its implementing regulations reach intentional discrimination or that they do not do so. What Cannon did hold is that all the discrimination prohibited by the regulatory scheme contained in Title IX may be the subject of a private lawsuit. As the Court today concedes that Cannon's holding applies to Title VI claims as well as Title IX claims, ante, at 3-4, and assumes that the regulations promulgated pursuant to 602 are validly promulgated antidiscrimination measures, ante, at 5, it is clear that today's opinion is in substantial tension with Cannon's reasoning and holding.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn5-1"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5-1_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; None of the relevant opinions was absolutely clear as to whether it envisioned such suits as being brought directly under the statute or under 42 U.S.C.  1983. However, a close reading of the opinions leaves little doubt that all of the Justices making up the Guardians majority contemplated the availability of private actions brought directly under the statute. Justice White fairly explicitly rested his conclusion on Cannon's holding that an implied right of action exists to enforce the terms of both Title VI and Title IX. Guardians, 463 U.S., at 594-595. Given that fact and the added consideration that his opinion appears to have equally contemplated suits against private and public parties, it is clear that he envisioned the availability of injunctive relief directly under the statute. Justice Marshall's opinion never mentions 1983 and refers simply to "Title VI actions." Id., at 625. In addition, his opinion can only be read as contemplating suits on equal terms against both public and private grantees, thus also suggesting that he assumed such suits could be brought directly under the statute. That leaves my opinion. Like Justice White, I made it quite clear that I believed the right to sue to enforce the disparate-impact regulations followed directly from Cannon and, hence, was built directly into the statute. 463 U.S., at 635-636, and n. 1. However, I did also note that, in the alternative, relief would be available in that particular case under 1983.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn6-1"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6-1_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The Court today cites one sentence in my final footnote in Guardians that it suggests is to the contrary. Ante, at 7 (citing 463 U.S., at 645, n. 18). However, the Court misreads that sentence. In his opinion in Guardians, Justice Powell had stated that he would affirm the judgment for the reasons stated in his dissent in Cannon, see 463 U.S., at 609-610 (opinion concurring in judgment), and that he would also hold that private actions asserting violations of Title VI could not be brought under 1983, id., at 610, and n. 3. One reason that he advanced in support of these conclusions was his view that the standard of proof in a 1983 action against public officials would differ from the standard in an action against private defendants. Id., at 608, n. 1. In a footnote at the end of my opinion, id., at 645, n. 18, I responded (perhaps inartfully) to Justice Powell. I noted that the fact that 1983 authorizes a lawsuit against the police department based on its violation of the governing administrative regulations did not mean, as Justice Powell had suggested, "that a similar action would be unavailable against a similarly situated private party." Ibid. I added the sentence that the Court quotes today, ante at 7, not to reserve a question, but rather to explain that the record did not support Justice Powell's hypothesis regarding the standard of proof. I thought then, as I do now, that a violation of regulations adopted pursuant to Title VI may be established by proof of discriminatory impact in a 1983 action against state actors and also in an implied action against private parties. See n. 5, supra. Contrary to the Court's partial quotation of my opinion, see ante, at 7, n. 3, what I wrote amply reflected what I thought. See 463 U.S., at 635 ("a private action against recipients of federal funds"), id., at 636 ("implied caus[e] of action"); id., at 638 ("Title VI authorizes appropriate relief"). Justice Powell was quite correct in noting that it would be anomalous to assume that Congress would have intended to make it easier to recover from public officials than from private parties. That anomaly, however, does not seem to trouble the majority today.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; The settled expectations the Court undercuts today derive not only from judicial decisions, but also from the consistent statements and actions of Congress. Congress' actions over the last two decades reflect a clear understanding of the existence of a private right action to enforce Title VI and its implementing regulations. In addition to numerous other small-scale amendments, Congress has twice adopted legislation expanding the reach of Title VI. See Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, 6, 102 Stat. 31 (codified at 42 U.S.C.  2000d-4a) (expanding definition of "program"); Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 1003, 100 Stat. 1845 (codified at 42 U.S.C.  2000d-7) (explicitly abrogating States' Eleventh Amendment immunity in suits under Title VI). Both of these bills were adopted after this Court's decision in Lau, Cannon, and Guardians, and after most of the Courts of Appeals had affirmatively acknowledged an implied private right of action to enforce the disparate impact regulations. Their legislative histories explicitly reflect the fact that both proponents and opponents of the bills assumed that the full breadth of Title VI (including the disparate impact regulations promulgated pursuant to it) would be enforceable in private actions. See, e.g., Civil Rights Act of 1984: Hearings on S. 2658 before the Subcommittee. on the Constitution of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., 530 (1984) (memo from the Office of Management and Budget objecting to the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 because it would bring more entities within the scope of Title VI thereby subjecting them to "private lawsuits" to enforce the disparate impact regulations); id. at 532 (same memo warning of a proliferation of "discriminatory effects" suits by "members of the bar" acting as "private Attorneys General"); 134 Cong. Rec. 4257 (1988) (statement of Sen. Hatch) (arguing that the disparate impact regulations go too far and noting that that is a particular problem because "[o]f course, advocacy groups will be able to bring private lawsuits making the same allegations before federal judges"); see also Brief for United States 24, n. 16 (collecting testimony of academics advising Congress that private lawsuits were available to enforce the disparate impact regulations under existing precedent). Thus, this case goes well beyond the normal situation in which "after a comprehensive reeaxmination and significant amendment" Congress "left intact the statutory provisions under which the federal courts had implied a private cause of action." Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp;amp; Smith, Inc. v. Curran, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yUD/merrill-lynch-pierce-fenner-smith-inc-v-curran/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;456&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;353&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 381-382 (1982). Here, there is no need to rest on presumptions of knowledge and ratification, because the direct evidence of Congress' understanding is plentiful.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn10_ref"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The remainder of Title VI provides for judicial and administrative review of agency actions taken pursuant to the statute, 2000d-2; imposes certain limitations not at issue in this case, 2000d-3 to 2000d-4; and defines some of the terms found in the other provisions of the statute, 200d-4a.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; It is important, in this context, to note that regulations prohibiting policies that have a disparate impact are not necessarily aimed only-or even primarily-at unintentional discrimination. Many policies whose very intent is to discriminate are framed in a race-neutral manner. It is often difficult to obtain direct evidence of this motivating animus. Therefore, an agency decision to adopt disparate&amp;amp;nbhyph;impact regulations may very well reflect a determination by that agency that substantial intentional discrimination pervades the industry it is charged with regulating but that such discrimination is difficult to prove directly. As I have stated before: "Frequently the most probative evidence of intent will be objective evidence of what actually happened rather than evidence describing the subjective state of mind of the actor." Washington v. Davis, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yxp/washington-v-davis/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;426&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;229&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 253 (1976) (concurring opinion). On this reading, Title VI simply accords the agencies the power to decide whether or not to credit such evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn14"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn14_ref"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; See, e.g., Alexander v. Choate, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z5X/alexander-v-choate/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;469&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;287&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 293 (1985) (stating, in dicta, "Title VI itself directly reach[es] only instances of intentional discrimination"); Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yZW/guardians-assn-v-civil-serv-commn-of-new-york-city/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;463&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;582&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1983) (in separate opinions, seven Justices indicate that 601 on its face bars only intentional discrimination).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn15"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn15_ref"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Of course, those five Justices divided over the application of the Equal Protection Clause-and by extension Title VI-to affirmative action cases. Therefore, it is somewhat strange to treat the opinions of those five Justices in Bakke as constituting a majority for any particular substantive interpretation of Title VI.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn16"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn16_ref"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The fact that Justices Marshall and White both felt that the opinion they coauthored in Bakke did not resolve the question whether Title VI on its face reaches disparate-impact claims belies the majority's assertion that Bakke "had drawn precisely that distinction," ante, at 6, n. 2, much less its implication that it would have been "absurd" to think otherwise, ibid.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn17"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn17_ref"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; In this context, it is worth noting that in a variety of other settings the Court has interpreted similarly ambiguous civil rights provisions to prohibit some policies based on their disparate impact on a protected group. See, e.g., Griggs v. Duke Power Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ybY/griggs-v-duke-power-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;401&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;424&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 432 (1971) (Title VII); City of Rome v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yLQ/city-of-rome-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;446&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;156&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 172-173 (1980) (5 of the Voting Rights Act); cf. Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S., at 292-296 (explaining why the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which was modeled after 601, might be considered to reach some instances of disparate impact and then assuming that it does for purposes of deciding the case).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn18"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn18_ref"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; In relying on the Chevron doctrine, I do not mean to suggest that our decision in Chevron stated a new rule that requires the wholesale reconsideration of our statutory interpretation precedents. Instead, I continue to adhere to my position in Sullivan v. Everhart, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zpw/sullivan-v-everhart/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;494&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;83&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 103-104, n. 6 (1990) (stating that Chevron merely summarized "well-settled principles"). In suggesting that, with regard to Title VI, we might reconsider whether our prior decisions gave sufficient deference to the agencies' interpretation of the statute, I do no more than question whether in this particular instance we paid sufficient consideration to those "well-settled principles."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn19"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn19_ref"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The legislative history strongly indicates that the Congress that adopted Title VI and the administration that proposed the statute intended that the agencies and departments would utilize the authority granted under 602 to shape the substantive contours of 601. For example, during the hearings that preceded the passage of the statute, Attorney General Kennedy agreed that the administrators of the various agencies would have the power to define "what constitutes discrimination" under Title VI and "what acts or omissions are to be forbidden." Civil Rights-The Presidents Program, 1963: Hearings before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 399-400 (1963); see also Civil Rights: Hearings before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 4, p. 2740 (1963) (remarks of Attorney General Kennedy) (only after the agencies "establish the rules" will recipients "understand what they can and cannot do"). It was, in fact, concern for this broad delegation that inspired Congress to amend the pending bill to ensure that all regulations issued pursuant to Title VI would have to be approved by the President. See 42 U.S.C.  2000d-1 (laying out the requirement); 110 Cong. Rec. 2499 (1964) (remarks of Rep. Lindsay introducing the amendment). For further discussion of this legislative history, see Guardians, 463 U.S., at 615-624 (Marshall, J., dissenting); Abernathy, Title VI and the Constitution: A Regulatory Model for Defining "Discrimination," 70 Geo. L. J. 1 (1981).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn20"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn20_ref"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The majority twice suggests that I "be[g] the question" whether a private right of action to enforce Title VI necessarily encompasses a right of action to enforce the regulations validly promulgated pursuant to the statute. Ante, at 6, n. 2, 17, n. 8. As the above analysis demonstrates, I do no such thing. On the contrary, I demonstrate that the disparate-impact regulations promulgated pursuant to 602 are-and have always been considered to be-an important part of an integrated remedial scheme intended to promote the statute's antidiscrimination goals. Given that fact, there is simply no logical or legal justification for differentiating between actions to enforce the regulations and actions to enforce the statutory text. Furthermore, as my integrated approach reflects the longstanding practice of this Court, see n. 2, supra, it is the majority's largely unexplained assumption that a private right of action to enforce the disparate-impact regulations must be independently established that "begs the question."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn21"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn21_ref"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The text of the statute contained "an unmistakable focus on the benefited class," 441 U.S., at 691; its legislative history "rather plainly indicates that Congress intended to create such a remedy," id., at 694; the legislators' repeated references to private enforcement of Title VI reflected "their intent with respect to Title IX," id., at 696-698; and the absence of legislative action to change the prevailing view with respect to Title VI left us with "no doubt that Congress intended to create Title IX remedies comparable to those available under Title VI and that it understood Title VI as authorizing an implied private cause of action for victims of prohibited discrimination," id., at 703.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn22"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn22_ref"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; We should not overlook the fact that Cannon was decided after the Bakke majority had concluded that the coverage of Title VI was co-extensive with the coverage of the Equal Protection Clause.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn23"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn23_ref"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Like any other type of evidence, contextual evidence may be trumped by other more persuasive evidence. Thus, the fact that, when evaluating older statutes, we have at times reached the conclusion that Congress did not imply a private right of action does not have the significance the majority suggests. Ante, at 13-14.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn24"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn24_ref"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Only one of this Court's myriad private right of action cases even hints at such a rule. See Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B2F/central-bank-of-denver-na-v-first-interstate-bank-/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;511&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;164&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 173 (1994). Even that decision, however, does not fully support the majority's position for two important reasons. First, it is not at all clear that the majority opinion in that case simply held that the regulation in question could not be enforced by private action; the opinion also permits the reading, assumed by the dissent, that the majority was in effect invalidating the regulation in question. Id., at 200 (Stevens, J., dissenting) ("The majority leaves little doubt that the Exchange Act does not even permit the SEC to pursue aiders and abettors in civil enforcement actions under 10(b) and Rule 10b-5"). Second, that case involved a right of action that the Court has forthrightly acknowledged was judicially created in exactly the way the majority now condemns. See, e.g., Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/awvW/blue-chip-stamps-v-manor-drug-stores/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;421&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;723&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 737 (1975) (describing private actions under Rule 10b-5 as "a judicial oak which has grown from little more than a legislative acorn"). As the action in question was in effect a common-law right, the Court was more within its rights to limit that remedy than it would be in a case, such as this one, where we have held that Congress clearly intended such a right.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn25"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn25_ref"&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; See Guardians, 463 U.S., at 636 (Stevens, J., dissenting) ("It is one thing to conclude, as the Court did in Cannon, that the 1964 Congress, legislating when implied causes of action were the rule rather than the exception, reasonably assumed that the intended beneficiaries of Title VI would be able to vindicate their rights in court. It is quite another thing to believe that the 1964 Congress substantially qualified that assumption but thought it unnecessary to tell the Judiciary about the qualification").&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote"&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The majority suggests that its failure to offer such support is irrelevant, because the burden is on the party seeking to establish the existence of an implied right of action. Ante, at 17, n. 8. That response confuses apples and oranges. Undoubtedly, anyone seeking to bring a lawsuit has the burden of establishing that private individuals have the right to bring such a suit. However, once the courts have examined the statutory scheme under which the individual seeks to bring a suit and determined that a private right of action does exist, judges who seek to impose heretofore unrecognized limits on that right have a responsibility to offer reasoned arguments drawn from the text, structure, or history of that statute in order to justify such limitations. Moreover, in this case, the petitioners have marshaled substantial affirmative evidence that a private right of action exists to enforce Title VI and the regulations validly promulgated thereunder. See supra, at 21-22. It strikes me that it aids rather than hinders their case that this evidence is already summarized in an opinion of this Court. See Cannon, 441 U.S., at 691-703.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*191&lt;/span&gt; Rehnquist, C. J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. &lt;i&gt;Thomas S. Kerrigan&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed briefs for petitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jeffrey A. Lamken&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Ogden, Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler, Mark B. Stern, Jacob M. Lewis,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Daniel L. Kaplan.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stephen A. Seideman&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*191&lt;/span&gt; Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California Labor Code (Code or Labor Code) authorizes the State to order withholding of payments due a contractor on a public works project if a subcontractor on the project fails to comply with certain Code requirements. The Code permits the contractor, in turn, to withhold similar sums from the subcontractor. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the relevant Code provisions violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the statutory scheme does not afford the subcontractor a hearing before or after such action is taken. We granted certiorari, 531 U. S. 924 (2000), and we reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners are the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), the California Department of Industrial Relations, and several state officials in their official capacities. Respondent G &amp;amp; G Fire Sprinklers, Inc. (G &amp;amp; G), is a fire-protection company that installs fire sprinkler systems. G &amp;amp; G served as a subcontractor on several California public works projects. "Public works" include construction work done under contract and paid for in whole or part by public funds. Cal. Lab. Code Ann. &#167; 1720 (West Supp. 2001). The department, board, authority, officer, or agent awarding a contract for public work is called the "awarding body." &#167; 1722 (West 1989). The California Labor Code requires that contractors and subcontractors on such projects pay their workers a prevailing wage that is determined by the State. &#167;&#167; 1771, 1772, 1773 (West 1989 and Supp. 2001). At the time relevant here, if workers were not paid the prevailing wage, the contractor was required to pay each worker the difference between the prevailing wage and the wages paid, in addition to forfeiting a penalty to the State. &#167; 1775 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*192&lt;/span&gt; (West Supp. 2001).&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The awarding body was required to include a clause in the contract so stipulating. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Labor Code provides that "[b]efore making payments to the contractor of money due under a contract for public work, the awarding body shall withhold and retain therefrom all wages and penalties which have been forfeited pursuant to any stipulation in a contract for public work, and the terms of this chapter." &#167; 1727. If money is withheld from a contractor because of a subcontractor's failure to comply with the Code's provisions, "[i]t shall be lawful for [the] contractor to withhold from [the] subcontractor under him sufficient sums to cover any penalties withheld." &#167; 1729 (West 1989).&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Labor Code permits the contractor, or his assignee, to bring suit against the awarding body "on the contract for alleged breach thereof in not making . . . payment" to recover the wages or penalties withheld. &#167;&#167; 1731, 1732 (West Supp. 2001). The suit must be brought within 90 days of completion of the contract and acceptance of the job. &#167; 1730. Such a suit "is the exclusive remedy of the contractor &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*193&lt;/span&gt; or his or her assignees." &#167; 1732. The awarding body retains the wages and penalties "pending the outcome of the suit." &#167; 1731.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1995, DLSE determined that G &amp;amp; G, as a subcontractor on three public works projects, had violated the Labor Code by failing to pay the prevailing wage and failing to keep and/or furnish payroll records upon request. DLSE issued notices to the awarding bodies on those projects, directing them to withhold from the contractors an amount equal to the wages and penalties forfeited due to G &amp;amp; G's violations. The awarding bodies withheld payment from the contractors, who in turn withheld payment from G &amp;amp; G. The total withheld, according to respondent, exceeded $135,000. App. 68.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G &amp;amp; G sued petitioners in the District Court for the Central District ofCalifornia. G &amp;amp; G sought declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to Rev. Stat. &#167; 1979, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1983, claiming that the issuance of withholding notices without a hearing constituted a deprivation of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment, declared &#167;&#167; 1727, 1730-1733, 1775, 1776(g), and 1813 of the Labor Code unconstitutional, and enjoined the State from enforcing these provisions &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*194&lt;/span&gt; against respondent. App. to Pet. for Cert. A85&#151;A87. Petitioners appealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. &lt;i&gt;G &amp;amp; G Fire Sprinklers, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bradshaw,&lt;/i&gt; 156 F. 3d 893, 898 (1998) &lt;i&gt;(Bradshaw I)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; The court concluded that G &amp;amp; G "has a property interest in being paid in full for the construction work it has completed," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 901, and found that G &amp;amp; G was deprived of that interest "as a result of the state's action," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 903. It decided that because subcontractors were "afforded neither a pre- nor postdeprivation hearing when payments [were] withheld," the statutory scheme violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 904.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;i&gt;Bradshaw I,&lt;/i&gt; we decided &lt;i&gt;American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sullivan,&lt;/i&gt; 526 U. S. 40 (1999), where respondents also alleged a deprivation of property without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. &lt;i&gt;Sullivan&lt;/i&gt;  involved a challenge to a private insurer's decision to withhold payment for disputed medical treatment pending review of its reasonableness and necessity, as authorized by state law. We held that the insurer's action was not "fairly attributable to the State," and that respondents therefore failed to satisfy a critical element of their &#167; 1983 claim. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 58. We also decided that because state law entitled respondents to reasonable and necessary medical treatment, respondents had no property interest in payment for medical treatment not yet deemed to meet those criteria. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 61. We granted certiorari in &lt;i&gt;Bradshaw I,&lt;/i&gt; vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remanded for reconsideration in light of &lt;i&gt;Sullivan. Bradshaw&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;G &amp;amp; G Fire Sprinklers, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 526 U. S. 1061 (1999).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On remand, the Court of Appeals reinstated its prior judgment and opinion, again by a divided vote. The court held that the withholding of payments was state action because it was "specifically directed by State officials . . . [and] the withholding party has no discretion." &lt;i&gt;G &amp;amp; G Fire&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*195&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sprinklers, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bradshaw,&lt;/i&gt; 204 F. 3d 941, 944 (CA9 2000). In its view, itsprior opinion was consistent with &lt;i&gt;Sullivan&lt;/i&gt;  because it "specifically held that G &amp;amp; G did not have a right to payment of the disputed funds pending the outcome of whatever kind of hearing would be afforded," and "explicitly authorized the withholding of payments pending the hearing." 204 F. 3d, at 943. The court explained that G &amp;amp; G's rights were violated not because it was deprived of immediate payment, but "because the California statutory scheme afforded no hearing at all when state officials directed that payments be withheld." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 943-944.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where a state law such as this is challenged on due process grounds, we inquire whether the State has deprived the claimant of a protected property interest, and whether the State's procedures comport with due process. &lt;i&gt;Sullivan, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 59. We assume, without deciding, that the withholding of money due respondent under its contracts occurred under color of state law, and that, as the Court of Appeals concluded, respondent has a property interest of the kind we considered in &lt;i&gt;Logan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Zimmerman Brush Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 455 U. S. 422 (1982), in its claim for payment under its contracts. 204 F. 3d, at 943-944. Because we believe that California law affords respondent sufficient opportunity to pursue that claim in state court, we conclude that the California statutory scheme does not deprive G &amp;amp; G of its claim for payment without due process of law. See &lt;i&gt;Logan, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 433 ("[T]he Due Process Clause grants the aggrieved party the opportunity to present his case and have its merits fairly judged").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals relied upon several of our cases dealing with claims of deprivation of a property interest without due process to hold that G &amp;amp; G was entitled to a reasonably prompt hearing when payments were withheld. &lt;i&gt;Bradshaw I, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 903-904 (citing &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;James Daniel Good Real Property,&lt;/i&gt; 510 U. S. 43 (1993); &lt;i&gt;FDIC&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mallen,&lt;/i&gt; 486 U. S. 230 (1988); &lt;i&gt;Barry&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Barchi,&lt;/i&gt; 443 U. S. 55 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*196&lt;/span&gt; (1979)). In &lt;i&gt;Good,&lt;/i&gt; we held that the Government must afford the owner of a house subject to forfeiture as property used to commit or to facilitate commission of a federal drug offense notice and a hearing before seizing the property. 510 U. S., at 62. In &lt;i&gt;Barchi,&lt;/i&gt; we held that a racetrack trainer suspended for 15 days on suspicion of horse drugging was entitled to a prompt postdeprivation administrative or judicial hearing. 443 U. S.,at 63-64. And in &lt;i&gt;Mallen,&lt;/i&gt; we held that the president of a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured bank suspended from office by the FDIC was accorded due process by a notice and hearing procedure which would render a decision within 90 days of the suspension. 486 U. S., at 241-243. See also &lt;i&gt;Sniadach&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Family Finance Corp. of Bay View,&lt;/i&gt; 395 U. S. 337 (1969) (holding that due process requires notice and a hearing before wages may be garnished).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these cases, the claimant was denied a right by virtue of which he was presently entitled either to exercise ownership dominion over real or personal property, or to pursue a gainful occupation. Unlike those claimants, respondent has not been denied any present entitlement. G &amp;amp; G has been deprived of payment that it contends it isowed under a contract, based on the State's determination that G &amp;amp; G failed to comply with the contract's terms. G &amp;amp; G has only a claim that it did comply with those terms and therefore that it is entitled to be paid in full. Though we assume for purposes of decision here that G &amp;amp; G has a property interest in its claim for payment, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 195, it is an interest, unlike the interests discussed above, that can be fully protected by an ordinary breach-of-contract suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Cafeteria &amp;amp; Restaurant Workers&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McElroy,&lt;/i&gt; 367 U. S. 886, 895 (1961) (citations omitted), we said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The very nature of due process negates any concept of inflexible procedures universally applicable to every imaginable situation. ` "[D]ue process," unlike some legal rules, is not a technical conception with a fixed &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*197&lt;/span&gt; content unrelated to time, place and circumstances.' It is `compounded of history, reason, the past course of decisions . . . .' "&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hold that if California makes ordinary judicial process available to respondent for resolving its contractual dispute, that process is due process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California Labor Code provides that "the contractor or his or her assignee" may sue the awarding body "on the contract for alleged breach thereof" for "the recovery of wages or penalties." &#167;&#167; 1731, 1732 (West Supp. 2001). There is no basis here to conclude that the contractor would refuse to assign the right of suit to its subcontractor. In fact, respondent stated at oral argument that it has sued awarding bodies in state superior court pursuant to &#167;&#167; 1731&#151; 1733 of the Labor Code to recover payments withheld on previous projects where it served as a subcontractor. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, 40-41, 49-50. Presumably, respondent brought suit as an assignee of the contractors on those projects, as the Code requires. &#167; 1732 (West Supp. 2001). Thus, the Labor Code, by allowing assignment, provides a means by which a subcontractor may bring a claim for breach of contract to recover wages and penalties withheld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent complains that a suit under the Labor Code is inadequate because the awarding body retains the wages and penalties "pending the outcome of the suit," &#167; 1731, which may last several years. Tr. of Oral Arg. 51. A lawsuit of that duration, while undoubtedly something of a hardship, cannot be said to deprive respondent of its claim for payment under the contract. Lawsuits are not known for expeditiously resolving claims, and the standard practice in breach-of-contract suits is to award damages, if appropriate, only at the conclusion of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if respondent could not obtain assignment of the right to sue the awarding body under the contract, it appears that a suit for breach of contract against the contractor remains available under California common law. See 1 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*198&lt;/span&gt; B. Witkin, Summary of California Law &#167;&#167; 791, 797 (9th ed. 1987) (defining breach as the "unjustified or unexcused . . . failure to perform a contract" and describing the remedies available under state law). To be sure, &#167; 1732 of the Labor Code provides that suit on the contract against the awarding body is the "exclusive remedy of the contractor or his or her assignees" with respect to recovery of withheld wages and penalties. &#167; 1732 (West Supp. 2001). But the remedy is exclusive only with respect to the contractor and his assignees, and thus by its terms not the exclusive remedy for a subcontractor who does not receive assignment. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;J &amp;amp; K Painting Co., Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bradshaw,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/calctapp/cz3v/j-k-painting-co-v-bradshaw/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;45&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Cal. App. 4th&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1394&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 1402, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Cal. Rptr. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;496&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 501 (1996) (allowing subcontractor to challenge Labor Commissioner's action by petition for a writ of the mandate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;J &amp;amp; K Painting,&lt;/i&gt; the California Court of Appeal rejected the argument that &#167; 1732 requires a subcontractor to obtain an assignment and that failure to do so is "fatal to any other attempt to secure relief." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1401, n. 7, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 501, n. 7. The Labor Code does not expressly impose such a requirement, and that court declined to infer an intent to "create remedial exclusivity" in this context. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; It thus appears that subcontractors like respondent may pursue their claims for payment by bringing a standard breach-of-contract suit against the contractor under California law. Our view is necessarily tentative, since the final determination of the question rests in the hands of the California courts, but respondent has not convinced us that this avenue of relief is closed to it. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 1401, and n. 4, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 500, and n. 4 (noting that the contractor might assert a variety of defenses to the subcontractor's suit for breach of contract without evaluating their soundness). As the party challenging the statutory withholding scheme, respondent bears the burden of demonstrating its unconstitutionality. Cf. &lt;i&gt;INS&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chadha,&lt;/i&gt; 462 U. S. 919, 944 (1983) (statutes presumed constitutional). We &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*199&lt;/span&gt; therefore conclude that the relevant provisions of the California Labor Code do not deprive respondent of property without due process of law. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   Briefs of &lt;i&gt;amici curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal were filed for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations by &lt;i&gt;Jonathan P. Hiatt, James B. Coppess, Scott A. Kronland,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Laurence Gold;&lt;/i&gt;  and for the Port of Oakland et al. by &lt;i&gt;David L. Alexander&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Christopher H. Alonzi.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The Code also imposes restrictions on recordkeeping and working hours, and at the time relevant here, the contractor was similarly penalized if the contractor or subcontractor failed to comply with them. Cal. Lab. Code Ann. &#167;&#167; 1776(a), (b), (g) (West Supp. 2001), 1813 (West 1989). The awarding body was required to include a clause in the contract so stipulating. &#167;&#167; 1776(h), 1813.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sections 1775, 1776, and 1813 were subsequently amended to provide that both contractors and subcontractors may be penalized for failure to comply with the Labor Code. &#167;&#167; 1775(a), 1776(g), 1813 (West Supp. 2001). Amendments to &#167; 1775 also state that either the contractor or the subcontractor may pay workers the difference between the prevailing wage and wages paid. &#167; 1775(a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Amendments to the Labor Code effective July 1, 2001, impose additional requirements on contractors. See &#167; 1727(b) (West Supp. 2001) (contractor shall withhold money from subcontractor at request of Labor Commissioner in certain circumstances); &#167; 1775(b)(3) (contractor shall take corrective action to halt subcontractor's failure to pay prevailing wages if aware of the failure or be subject to penalties).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Sections 1730-1733of the Code have been repealed,effectiveJuly 1, 2001. Section 1742 has replaced them. It provides that "[a]naffected contractor or subcontractor may obtain review of a civil wage and penalty assessment [underthe Code] by transmittinga written request to the office of the Labor Commissioner." &#167; 1742(a).The contractor or subcontractor is then entitled to a hearing before the Director of Industrial Relations, who shall appoint an impartial hearing officer.Within 45 days of the hearing, the director shall issue a written decision affirming, modifying,or dismissing the assessment. A contractor or subcontractor may obtain review of thedirector'sdecision by filinga petition fora writ of the mandate in state superiorcourt. &#167;&#167; 1742(b),(c).These provisions are not yet in effect and these procedures were not available to respondent at the time of the withholding of payments at issue here.&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*225&lt;/span&gt; Thomas, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. Ginsburg, J., filed a concurring opinion, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 232.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;David L. Ohler,&lt;/i&gt; Special Assistant Attorney General of Montana, argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Joseph P. Mazurek,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;Diana Leibinger-Koch,&lt;/i&gt; Special Assistant Attorney General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Patricia A. Millett&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal. With her on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Ogden, Deputy Solicitor General Underwood, Gregory G. Garre, Barbara L. Herwig,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;John Hoyle.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jeffrey T. Renz&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*225&lt;/span&gt; Justice Thomas, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under our decision in &lt;i&gt;Turner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Safley,&lt;/i&gt; 482 U. S. 78 (1987), restrictions on prisoners' communications to other inmates are constitutional if the restrictions are "reasonably related to legitimate penological interests." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 89. In this case, we are asked to decide whether prisoners possess a First Amendment right to provide legal assistance that enhances the protections otherwise available under &lt;i&gt;Turner.&lt;/i&gt;  We hold that they do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While respondent Kevin Murphy was incarcerated at the Montana State Prison, he served as an "inmate law clerk," providing legal assistance to fellow prisoners. Upon learning that inmate Pat Tracy had been charged with assaulting Correctional Officer Glen Galle, Murphy decided to assist Tracy with his defense. Prison rules prohibited Murphy's assignment to the case,&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; but he nonetheless investigated the assault. After discovering that other inmates had complained about Officer Galle's conduct, Murphy sent Tracy a letter, which included the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*226&lt;/span&gt; "I do want to help you with your case against Galle. It wasn't your fault and I know he provoked whatever happened! Don't plead guilty because we can get at least 100 witnesses to testify that Galle is an over zealous guard who has a personal agenda to punish and harrass &lt;i&gt;[sic]&lt;/i&gt; inmates. He has made homo-sexual &lt;i&gt;[sic]&lt;/i&gt; advances towards certain inmates and that can be brought up into the record. There are petitions against him and I have tried to get the Unit Manager to do something about what he does in Close II, but all that happened is that I received two writeups from him myself as retaliation. So we must pursue this out of the prison system. I am filing a suit with everyone in Close I and II named against him. So you can use that too!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Another point &lt;i&gt;[sic]&lt;/i&gt; is that he grabbed you from behind. You tell your lawyer to get a hold of me on this. Don't take a plea bargain unless it's for no more time." App. 50.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In accordance with prison policy, prison officials intercepted the letter, and petitioner Robert Shaw, an officer in the maximum-security unit, reviewed it. Based on the accusations against Officer Galle, Shaw cited Murphy for violations of the prison's rules prohibiting insolence, interference with due process hearings, and conduct that disrupts or interferes with the security and orderly operation of the institution. After a hearing, Murphy was found guilty of violating the first two prohibitions. The hearings officer sanctioned him by imposing a suspended sentence of 10 days' detention and issuing demerits that could affect his custody level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Murphy brought this action, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under Rev. Stat. &#167; 1979, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1983. The case was styled as a class action, brought on behalf of himself, other inmate law clerks, and other prisoners. The complaint alleged that the disciplining of Murphy &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*227&lt;/span&gt; violated due process, the rights of inmates to access the courts, and, as relevant here, Murphy's First Amendment rights, including the right to provide legal assistance to other inmates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After discovery, the District Court granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment on all of Murphy's claims. On the First Amendment claim, the court found that Murphy was not formally acting as an inmate law clerk when he wrote the letter, and that Murphy's claims should therefore "be analyzed without consideration of any privilege that law clerk status might provide." App. to Pet. for Cert. 24. The District Court then applied our decision in &lt;i&gt;Turner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Safley,&lt;/i&gt;  482 U. S. 78 (1987), which held that a prison regulation impinging on inmates' constitutional rights is valid "if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 89. Finding a "valid, rational connection between the prison inmate correspondence policy and the objectives of prison order, security, and inmate rehabilitation," the District Court rejected Murphy's First Amendment claim. App. to Pet. for Cert. 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. It premised its analysis on the proposition that "inmates have a First Amendment right to assist other inmates with their legal claims." 195 F. 3d 1121, 1124 (1999). Murphy enjoyed this right of association, the court concluded, because he was providing legal advice that potentially was relevant to Tracy's defense. The Court of Appeals then applied our decision in &lt;i&gt;Turner,&lt;/i&gt; but it did so only against the backdrop of this First Amendment right, which, the court held, affected the balance of the prisoner's interests against the government's interests. Concluding that the balance tipped in favor of Murphy, the Court of Appeals upheld Murphy's First Amendment claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Courts of Appeals have rejected similar claims. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gibbs&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hopkins,&lt;/i&gt; 10 F. 3d 373, 378 (CA6 1993) (no constitutional right to assist other inmates with legal &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*228&lt;/span&gt; claims); &lt;i&gt;Smith&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maschner,&lt;/i&gt; 899 F. 2d 940, 950 (CA10 1990) (same); &lt;i&gt;Gassler&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rayl,&lt;/i&gt; 862 F. 2d 706, 707-708 (CA8 1988) (same). To resolve the conflict, we granted certiorari. 530 U. S. 1303 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we are not asked to decide whether prisoners have &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; First Amendment rights when they send legal correspondence to one another. In &lt;i&gt;Turner,&lt;/i&gt; we held that restrictions on inmate-to-inmate communications pass constitutional muster only if the restrictions are reasonably related to legitimate and neutral governmental objectives. 482 U. S., at 89. We did not limit our holding to nonlegal correspondence, and petitioners do not ask us to construe it that way. Instead, the question presented here simply asks whether Murphy possesses a First Amendment right to provide legal advice that enhances the protections otherwise available under &lt;i&gt;Turner.&lt;/i&gt; The effect of such a right, as the Court of Appeals described it, 195 F. 3d, at 1127, would be that inmate-to-inmate correspondence that includes legal assistance would receive more First Amendment protection than correspondence without any legal assistance. We conclude that there is no such special right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, federal courts did not intervene in the internal affairs of prisons and instead "adopted a broad handsoff attitude toward problems of prison administration." &lt;i&gt;Procunier&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Martinez,&lt;/i&gt; 416 U. S. 396, 404 (1974). Indeed, for much of this country's history, the prevailing view was that a prisoner was a mere "slave of the State," who "not only forfeited his liberty, but all his personal rights except those which the law in its humanity accords him." &lt;i&gt;Jones&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 433 U. S. 119, 139 (1977) (Marshall, J., dissenting) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Ruffin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commonwealth,&lt;/i&gt; 62 Va. 790, 796 (1871)) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). In recent decades, however, this Court has determined that incarceration does not divest prisoners of all constitutional protections. Inmates &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*229&lt;/span&gt; retain, for example, the right to be free from racial discrimination, &lt;i&gt;Lee&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Washington,&lt;/i&gt; 390 U. S. 333 (1968) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt;  the right to due process, &lt;i&gt;Wolff&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McDonnell,&lt;/i&gt; 418 U. S. 539 (1974), and, as relevant here, certain protections of the First Amendment, &lt;i&gt;Turner, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We nonetheless have maintained that the constitutional rights that prisoners possess are more limited in scope than the constitutional rights held by individuals in society at large. In the First Amendment context, for instance, some rights are simply inconsistent with the status of a prisoner or "with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system," &lt;i&gt;Pell&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Procunier,&lt;/i&gt; 417 U. S. 817, 822 (1974). We have thus sustained proscriptions of media interviews with individual inmates, see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 833-835, prohibitions on the activities of a prisoners' labor union, see &lt;i&gt;North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 133, and restrictions on inmate-to-inmate written correspondence, see &lt;i&gt;Turner, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 93. Moreover, because the "problems of prisons in America are complex and intractable," and because courts are particularly "ill equipped" to deal with these problems, &lt;i&gt;Martinez, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 404-405, we generally have deferred to the judgments of prison officials in upholding these regulations against constitutional challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting this understanding, in &lt;i&gt;Turner&lt;/i&gt; we adopted a unitary, deferential standard for reviewing prisoners' constitutional claims: "[W]hen a prison regulation impinges on inmates' constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests." 482 U. S., at 89. Under this standard, four factors are relevant. First and foremost, "there must be a `valid, rational connection' between the prison regulation and the legitimate [and neutral] governmental interest put forward to justify it." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; (quoting &lt;i&gt;Block&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rutherford,&lt;/i&gt; 468 U. S. 576, 586 (1984)). If the connection between the regulation and the asserted goal is "arbitrary or irrational," then the regulation fails, irrespective of whether the other factors tilt in its &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*230&lt;/span&gt; favor. 482 U. S., at 89-90. In addition, courts should consider three other factors: the existence of "alternative means of exercising the right" available to inmates; "the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources generally"; and "the absence of ready alternatives" available to the prison for achieving the governmental objectives. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 90.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;i&gt;Turner&lt;/i&gt; provides the test for evaluating prisoners' First Amendment challenges, the issue before us is whether &lt;i&gt;Turner&lt;/i&gt; permits an increase in constitutional protection whenever a prisoner's communication includes legal advice. We conclude that it does not. To increase the constitutional protection based upon the content of a communication first requires an assessment of the value of that content.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; But the &lt;i&gt;Turner&lt;/i&gt; test, by its terms, simply does not accommodate valuations of content. On the contrary, the &lt;i&gt;Turner&lt;/i&gt; factors concern only the relationship between the asserted penological interests and the prison regulation. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 89.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, under &lt;i&gt;Turner&lt;/i&gt; and its predecessors, prison officials are to remain the primary arbiters of the problems that arise in prison management. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.;&lt;/i&gt; see also &lt;i&gt;Martinez, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 405 ("[C]ourts are illequipped to deal with the increasingly urgent problems of prison administration and reform"). If courts were permitted to enhance constitutional protection based on their assessments of the content of the particular communications, courts would be in a position to assume a greater role in decisions affecting prison administration. Seeking to avoid "`unnecessarily perpetuat[ing] the involvement of the federal courts in affairs of prison administration,' " &lt;i&gt;Turner,&lt;/i&gt; 482 U. S., at 89 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Martinez, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 407) (alteration in original), we reject &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*231&lt;/span&gt; an alteration of the &lt;i&gt;Turner&lt;/i&gt; analysis that would entail additional federal-court oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, even if we were to consider giving special protection to particular kinds of speech based upon content, we would not do so for speech that includes legal advice.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Augmenting First Amendment protection for inmate legal advice would undermine prison officials' ability to address the "complex and intractable" problems of prison administration. &lt;i&gt;Turner, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 84. Although supervised inmate legal assistance programs may serve valuable ends, it is "indisputable" that inmate law clerks "are sometimes a menace to prison discipline" and that prisoners have an "acknowledged propensity . . . to abuse both the giving and the seeking of [legal] assistance." &lt;i&gt;Johnson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Avery,&lt;/i&gt; 393 U. S. 483, 488, 490 (1969). Prisoners have used legal correspondence as a means for passing contraband and communicating instructions on how to manufacture drugs or weapons. See Brief for State of Florida et al. as &lt;i&gt;Amici Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 6-8; see also &lt;i&gt;Turner, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 93 ("[P]risoners could easily write in jargon or codes to prevent detection of their real messages"). The legal text also could be an excuse for making clearly inappropriate comments, which "may be expected to circulate among prisoners," &lt;i&gt;Thornburgh&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Abbott,&lt;/i&gt; 490 U. S. 401, 412 (1989), despite prison measures to screen individual inmates or officers from the remarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thus decline to cloak the provision of legal assistance with any First Amendment protection above and beyond the protection normally accorded prisoners' speech. Instead, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*232&lt;/span&gt; the proper constitutional test is the one we set forth in &lt;i&gt;Turner.&lt;/i&gt; Irrespective of whether the correspondence contains legal advice, the constitutional analysis is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under &lt;i&gt;Turner,&lt;/i&gt; the question remains whether the prison regulations, as applied to Murphy, are "reasonably related to legitimate penological interests." 482 U. S., at 89. To prevail, Murphy must overcome the presumption that the prison officials acted within their "broad discretion." &lt;i&gt;Abbott, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 413. Petitioners ask us to answer, rather than remand, the question whether Murphy has satisfied this heavy burden. We decline petitioners' request, however, because we granted certiorari only to decide whether inmates possess a special First Amendment right to provide legal assistance to fellow inmates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Ginsburg, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with the Court that the Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the First Amendment secures to prisoners a freestanding right to provide legal assistance to other inmates. I note, furthermore, that Murphy does not contest the prison's right to intercept prisoner-to-prisoner correspondence. But Murphy's &#167; 1983 complaint does allege that the prison rules under which he was disciplined&#151;rules forbidding insolence and interference with due process hearings&#151;are vague and overbroad as applied to him in this case.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; The Ninth Circuit passed over that charge when it &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*233&lt;/span&gt; ruled, erroneously, that an inmate's provision of legal assistance to another inmate is an activity specially protected by the First Amendment. 195 F. 3d 1121, 1128 (1999). The remand for which the Court provides should not impede Murphy from reasserting claims that the Court of Appeals so far has left untouched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1]  Tracy had requested that Murphy be assigned to his case. App. 84. Prison officials, however, denied that request because prison policy forbade high-security inmates, such as Murphy, from meeting with maximumsecurity inmates, including Tracy. App. to Pet. for Cert. 19. Prison officials offered Tracy another law clerk to assist him.App. 84.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The Court of Appeals made such an assessment when it "`balance[d] the importance of the prisoner's infringed right against the importance of the penological interest served by the rule.' " 195 F. 3d 1121, 1127 (CA9 1999) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Bradley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hall,&lt;/i&gt; 64 F. 3d 1276, 1280 (CA9 1995)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Murphy suggests that the right to provide legal advice follows from a right to receive legal advice. However, even if one right followed from the other, Murphy is incorrect in his assumption that there is a freestanding right to receive legal advice. Under our right-of-access precedents, inmates have a right to receive legal advice from other inmates only when it is a necessary "means for ensuring a `reasonably adequate opportunity to present claimed violations of fundamental constitutional rights to the courts.' "&lt;i&gt;Lewis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Casey,&lt;/i&gt; 518 U. S. 343, 350-351 (1996) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Bounds&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Smith,&lt;/i&gt; 430 U. S. 817, 825 (1977)).&lt;/p&gt;

Although Murphy undoubtedly knew that his letter to Tracy would be read by prison officials, there is no record evidence contesting Murphy's sworn statement that he "did not believe that Officer Galle would read the letter."

    &lt;p class="docket"&gt;No. 99-1613.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="date"&gt;Argued January 16, 2001&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Syllabus&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While respondent Murphy was incarcerated in state prison, he learned that a fellow inmate had been charged with assaulting a correctional officer. Murphy decided to assist the inmate with his defense and sent him a letter, which was intercepted in accordance with prison policy. Based on the letter's content, the prison sanctioned Murphy for violating prison rules prohibiting insolence and interfering with due process hearings. Murphy then sought declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C.  1983 alleging that the disciplinary action violated, inter alia, his First Amendment rights, including the right to provide legal assistance to other inmates. In granting petitioners summary judgment, the District Court applied the decision in Turner v. Safley, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zgo/turner-v-safley/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;482&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;78&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 89-that a prison regulation impinging on inmates' constitutional rights is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests-and found a valid, rational connection between the inmate correspondence policy and the objectives of prison order, security, and inmate rehabilitation. The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that inmates have a First Amendment right to give legal assistance to other inmates and that this right affected the Turner analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Held:   1. Inmates do not possess a special First Amendment right to provide legal assistance to fellow inmates that enhances the protections otherwise available under Turner. Prisoners' constitutional rights are more limited in scope than the constitutional rights held by individuals in society at large. For instance, some First Amendment rights are simply inconsistent with the corrections system's "legitimate penological objectives," Pell v. Procunier, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yqF/pell-v-procunier/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;417&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;817&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 822, and thus this Court has sustained restrictions on, e.g., inmate-to-inmate written correspondence, Turner, supra, at 93. Moreover, because courts are ill equipped to deal with the complex and intractable problems of prisons, Procunier v. Martinez, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ypA/procunier-v-martinez/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;416&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;396&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 404-405, this Court has generally deferred to prison officials' judgment in upholding such regulations against constitutional challenge. Turner reflects this understanding, setting a unitary, deferential standard for reviewing prisoners' claims that does not permit an increase in the constitutional protection whenever a prisoner's communication includes legal advice. To increase the constitutional protection based upon a communication's content first requires an assessment of that content's value. But the Turner test simply does not accommodate valuations of content. On the contrary, it concerns only the relationship between the asserted penological interests and the prison regulation. Moreover, prison officials are to remain the primary arbiters of the problems that arise in prison management. 482 U.S., at 89. Seeking to avoid unnecessarily perpetuating federal courts' involvement in prison administration affairs, the Court rejects an alteration of the Turner analysis that would entail additional federal-court oversight. Even if this Court were to consider giving special protection to particular kinds of speech based on content, it would not do so for speech that includes legal advice. Augmenting First Amendment protection for such advice would undermine prison officials' ability to address the complex and intractable problems of prison administration. Id., at 84. The legal text could be an excuse for making clearly inappropriate comments, which may circulate among prisoners despite prison measures to screen individual inmates or officers from the remarks. Pp. 4-8.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;2. To prevail on remand on the question whether the prison regulations, as applied to Murphy, are reasonably related to legitimate penological interests, he must overcome the presumption that the prison officials acted within their broad discretion. P. 8.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="num" id="p1"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Under our decision in Turner v. Safley, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zgo/turner-v-safley/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;482&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;78&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1987), restrictions on prisoners' communications to other inmates are constitutional if the restrictions are "reasonably related to legitimate penological interests." Id., at 89. In this case, we are asked to decide whether prisoners possess a First Amendment right to provide legal assistance that enhances the protections otherwise available under Turner. We hold that they do not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p2"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;* While respondent Kevin Murphy was incarcerated at the Montana State Prison, he served as an "inmate law clerk," providing legal assistance to fellow prisoners. Upon learning that inmate Pat Tracy had been charged with assaulting Correctional Officer Glen Galle, Murphy decided to assist Tracy with his defense. Prison rules prohibited Murphy's assignment to the case,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; but he nonetheless investigated the assault. After discovering that other inmates had complained about Officer Galle's conduct, Murphy sent Tracy a letter, which included the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p3"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"I do want to help you with your case against Galle. It wasn't your fault and I know he provoked whatever happened! Don't plead guilty because we can get at least 100 witnesses to testify that Galle is an over zealous guard who has a personal agenda to punish and harrass [sic] inmates. He has made homo-sexual [sic] advances towards certain inmates and that can be brought up into the record. There are petitions against him and I have tried to get the Unit Manager to do something about what he does in Close II, but all that happened is that I received two writeups from him myself as retaliation. So we must pursue this out of the prison system. I am filing a suit with everyone in Close I and II named against him. So you can use that too!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p4"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Another poiont [sic] is that he grabbed you from behind. You tell your lawyer to get ahold of me on this. Don't take a plea bargain unless it's for no more time." App. 50.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p5"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In accordance with prison policy, prison officials intercepted the letter, and petitioner Robert Shaw, an officer in the maximum-security unit, reviewed it. Based on the accusations against Officer Galle, Shaw cited Murphy for violations of the prison's rules prohibiting insolence, interference with due process hearings, and conduct that disrupts or interferes with the security and orderly operation of the institution. After a hearing, Murphy was found guilty of violating the first two prohibitions. The hearings officer sanctioned him by imposing a suspended sentence of 10 days' detention and issuing demerits that could affect his custody level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p6"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In response, Murphy brought this action, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U.S.C.  1983. The case was styled as a class action, brought on behalf of himself, other inmate law clerks, and other prisoners. The complaint alleged that the disciplining of Murphy violated due process, the rights of inmates to access the courts, and, as relevant here, Murphy's First Amendment rights, including the right to provide legal assistance to other inmates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p7"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After discovery, the District Court granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment on all of Murphy's claims. On the First Amendment claim, the court found that Murphy was not formally acting as an inmate law clerk when he wrote the letter, and that Murphy's claims should therefore "be analyzed without consideration of any privilege that law clerk status might provide." App. to Pet. for Cert. 24. The District Court then applied our decision in Turner v. Safley, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zgo/turner-v-safley/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;482&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;78&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1987), which held that a prison regulation impinging on inmates' constitutional rights is valid "if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests," id., at 89. Finding a "valid, rational connection between the prison inmate correspondence policy and the objectives of prison order, security, and inmate rehabilitation," the District Court rejected Murphy's First Amendment claim. App. to Pet. for Cert. 25.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p8"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. It premised its analysis on the proposition that "inmates have a First Amendment right to assist other inmates with their legal claims." &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca9/4VUL/kevin-murphy-v-robert-shaw-unit-sergeant-larry-bea/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;195&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1121&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 1124 (1999). Murphy enjoyed this right of association, the court concluded, because he was providing legal advice that potentially was relevant to Tracy's defense. The Court of Appeals then applied our decision in Turner, but it did so only against the backdrop of this First Amendment right, which, the court held, affected the balance of the prisoner's interests against the government's interests. Concluding that the balance tipped in favor of Murphy, the Court of Appeals upheld Murphy's First Amendment claim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p9"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Other Courts of Appeals have rejected similar claims. See, e.g., Gibbs v. Hopkins, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca6/4nD9/paul-d-gibbs-v-robert-j-hopkins-pat-leavenworth/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;373&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 378 (CA6 1993) (no constitutional right to assist other inmates with legal claims); Smith v. Maschner, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca10/3LcE/jerry-wayne-smith-v-herb-maschner-director-dale-bo/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;899&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;940&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 950 (CA10 1990) (same); Gassler v. Rayl, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca8/3Dae/robert-gassler-jr-v-richard-rayl-terry-haines-and-/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;862&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;706&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 707-708 (CA8 1988) (same). To resolve the conflict, we granted certiorari. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;530&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1303&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;II&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p10"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In this case, we are not asked to decide whether prisoners have any First Amendment rights when they send legal correspondence to one another. In Turner, we held that restrictions on inmate-to-inmate communications pass constitutional muster only if the restrictions are reasonably related to legitimate and neutral governmental objectives. 482 U.S., at 89. We did not limit our holding to nonlegal correspondence, and petitioners do not ask us to construe it that way. Instead, the question presented here simply asks whether Murphy possesses a First Amendment right to provide legal advice that enhances the protections otherwise available under Turner. The effect of such a right, as the Court of Appeals described it, 195 F.3d, at 1127, would be that inmate-to-inmate correspondence that includes legal assistance would receive more First Amendment protection than correspondence without any legal assistance. We conclude that there is no such special right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p11"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, federal courts did not intervene in the internal affairs of prisons and instead "adopted a broad hands-off attitude toward problems of prison administration." Procunier v. Martinez, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ypA/procunier-v-martinez/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;416&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;396&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 404 (1974). Indeed, for much of this country's history, the prevailing view was that a prisoner was a mere "slave of the State," who "not only forfeited his liberty, but all his personal rights except those which the law in its humanity accords him." Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yBG/jones-v-north-carolina-prisoners-labor-union-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;433&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;119&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 139 (1977) (Marshall, J., dissenting) (quoting Ruffin v. Commonwealth, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;62&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Va.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;790&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 796 (1871)) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). In recent decades, however, this Court has determined that incarceration does not divest prisoners of all constitutional protections. Inmates retain, for example, the right to be free from racial discrimination, Lee v. Washington, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xZG/lee-v-washington/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;390&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;333&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1968) (per curiam), the right to due process, Wolff v. McDonnell, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yqZ/wolff-v-mcdonnell/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;418&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;539&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1974), and, as relevant here, certain protections of the First Amendment, Turner, supra.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p12"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We nonetheless have maintained that the constitutional rights that prisoners possess are more limited in scope than the constitutional rights held by individuals in society at large. In the First Amendment context, for instance, some rights are simply inconsistent with the status of a prisoner or "with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system," Pell v. Procunier, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yqF/pell-v-procunier/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;417&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;817&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 822 (1974). We have thus sustained proscriptions of media interviews with individual inmates, see id., at 833-835, prohibitions on the activities of a prisoners' labor union, see North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc., supra, at 133, and restrictions on inmate-to-inmate written correspondence, see Turner, supra, at 93. Moreover, because the "problems of prisons in America are complex and intractable," and because courts are particularly "ill equipped" to deal with these problems, Martinez, supra, at 404-405, we generally have deferred to the judgments of prison officials in upholding these regulations against constitutional challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p13"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Reflecting this understanding, in Turner we adopted a unitary, deferential standard for reviewing prisoners' constitutional claims: "[W]hen a prison regulation impinges on inmates' constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests." 482 U.S., at 89. Under this standard, four factors are relevant. First and foremost, "there must be a 'valid, rational connection' between the prison regulation and the legitimate [and neutral] governmental interest put forward to justify it." Ibid. (quoting Block v. Rutherford, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z5b/block-v-rutherford/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;468&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;576&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 586 (1984)). If the connection between the regulation and the asserted goal is "arbitrary or irrational," then the regulation fails, irrespective of whether the other factors tilt in its favor. 482 U.S., at 89-90. In addition, courts should consider three other factors: the existence of "alternative means of exercising the right" available to inmates; "the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources generally;" and "the absence of ready alternatives" available to the prison for achieving the governmental objectives. Id., at 90.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p14"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Because Turner provides the test for evaluating prisoners' First Amendment challenges, the issue before us is whether Turner permits an increase in constitutional protection whenever a prisoner's communication includes legal advice. We conclude that it does not. To increase the constitutional protection based upon the content of a communication first requires an assessment of the value of that content.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; But the Turner test, by its terms, simply does not accommodate valuations of content. On the contrary, the Turner factors concern only the relationship between the asserted penological interests and the prison regulation. Id., at 89.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p15"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Moreover, under Turner and its predecessors, prison officials are to remain the primary arbiters of the problems that arise in prison management. Ibid.; see also Martinez, 416 U.S., at 405 ("[C]ourts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent problems of prison administration and reform"). If courts were permitted to enhance constitutional protection based on their assessments of the content of the particular communications, courts would be in a position to assume a greater role in decisions affecting prison administration. Seeking to avoid " 'unnecessarily perpetuat[ing] the involvement of the federal courts in affairs of prison administration,' " Turner, 482 U.S., at 89 (quoting Martinez, supra, at 407) (alteration in original), we reject an alteration of the Turner analysis that would entail additional federal-court oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p16"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Finally, even if we were to consider giving special protection to particular kinds of speech based upon content, we would not do so for speech that includes legal advice.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; Augmenting First Amendment protection for inmate legal advice would undermine prison officials' ability to address the "complex and intractable" problems of prison administration. Turner, supra, at 84. Although supervised inmate legal assistance programs may serve valuable ends, it is "indisputable" that inmate law clerks "are sometimes a menace to prison discipline" and that prisoners have an "acknowledged propensity ... to abuse both the giving and the seeking of [legal] assistance." Johnson v. Avery, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/y4j/johnson-v-avery/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;393&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;483&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 488, 490 (1969). Prisoners have used legal correspondence as a means for passing contraband and communicating instructions on how to manufacture drugs or weapons. See Brief for State of Florida et al. as Amici Curiae 6-8; see also Turner, supra, at 93 ("[P]risoners could easily write in jargon or codes to prevent detection of their real messages"). The legal text also could be an excuse for making clearly inappropriate comments, which "may be expected to circulate among prisoners," Thornburgh v. Abbott, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/znu/thornburgh-v-abbott/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;490&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;401&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 412 (1989), despite prison measures to screen individual inmates or officers from the remarks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p17"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We thus decline to cloak the provision of legal assistance with any First Amendment protection above and beyond the protection normally accorded prisoners' speech. Instead, the proper constitutional test is the one we set forth in Turner. Irrespective of whether the correspondence contains legal advice, the constitutional analysis is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;III&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p18"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Under Turner, the question remains whether the prison regulations, as applied to Murphy, are "reasonably related to legitimate penological interests." Turner, supra, at 89. To prevail, Murphy must overcome the presumption that the prison officials acted within their "broad discretion." Abbott, supra, at 413. Petitioners ask us to answer, rather than remand, the question whether Murphy has satisfied this heavy burden. We decline petitioners' request, however, because we granted certiorari only to decide whether inmates possess a special First Amendment right to provide legal assistance to fellow inmates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p19"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p20"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p21"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; Tracy had requested that Murphy be assigned to his case. App. 84. Prison officials, however, denied that request because prison policy forbade high-security inmates, such as Murphy, from meeting with maximum-security inmates, including Tracy. App. to Pet. for Cert. 19. Prison officials offered Tracy another law clerk to assist him. App. 84.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The Court of Appeals made such an assessment when it "balance[d] the importance of the prisoner's infringed right against the importance of the penological interest served by the rule." See 195 F.3d, 1121, 1127 (CA9 1999) (quoting Bradley v. Hall, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca9/4B3o/95-cal-daily-op-serv-6644-95-daily-journal-dar-114/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1276&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 1280 (CA9 1995)).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Murphy suggests that the right to provide legal advice follows from a right to receive legal advice. However, even if one right followed from the other, Murphy is incorrect in his assumption that there is a freestanding right to receive legal advice. Under our right-of-access precedents, inmates have a right to receive legal advice from other inmates only when it is a necessary "means for ensuring a 'reasonably adequate opportunity to present claimed violations of fundamental constitutional rights to the courts.' " Lewis v. Casey, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B6q/lewis-v-casey/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;518&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;343&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 350-351 (1996) (quoting Bounds v. Smith, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yAp/bounds-v-smith/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;430&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;817&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 825 (1977)).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Justice Ginsburg, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I agree with the Court that the Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the First Amendment secures to prisoners a freestanding right to provide legal assistance to other inmates. I note, furthermore, that Murphy does not contest the prison's right to intercept prisoner-to-prisoner correspondence. But Murphy's 1983 complaint does allege that the prison rules under which he was disciplined-rules forbidding insolence and interference with due process hearings-are vague and overbroad as applied to him in this case&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn-s" id="fn-s_ref"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;. The Ninth Circuit passed over that charge when it ruled, erroneously, that an inmate's provision of legal assistance to another inmate is an activity specially protected by the First Amendment. &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca9/4VUL/kevin-murphy-v-robert-shaw-unit-sergeant-larry-bea/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;195&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1121&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 1128 (1999). The remand for which the Court provides should not impede Murphy from reasserting claims that the Court of Appeals so far has left untouched.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn-s_ref"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The rule forbidding insolence defines "insolence" as "[w]ords, actions or other behavior which is intended to harass or cause alarm in an employee." Mont. State Prison Policy No. 15-001, Inmate Disciplinary Policy, Rule 009 (App. 10) (emphasis added). The policy includes the following examples of insolence: "Cursing; abusive language, writing or gestures directed to an employee." Ibid. (emphasis added). The disciplinary report citing Murphy for violating the rule against insolence contains no finding that Murphy's letter was "directed to" Officer Galle or that the letter was "intended to harass" Officer Galle. App. 52. Although Murphy undoubtedly knew that his letter to Tracy would be read by prison officials, there is no record evidence contesting Murphy's sworn statement that he "did not believe that Officer Galle would read the letter." Murphy Affidavit 10 (App. 88).&lt;/p&gt;

Condon&lt;/i&gt; of South Carolina, and &lt;i&gt;Mark L. Earley&lt;/i&gt; of Virginia.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Souter, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is whether the Fourth Amendment forbids a warrantless arrest for a minor criminal offense, such as a misdemeanor seatbelt violation punishable only by a fine. We hold that it does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Texas, if a car is equipped with safety belts, a frontseat passenger must wear one, Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &#167; 545.413(a) (1999), and the driver must secure any small child riding in front, &#167; 545.413(b). Violation of either provision is "a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not less than $25 or more than $50." &#167; 545.413(d). Texas law expressly authorizes "[a]ny peace officer [to] arrest without warrant a person found committing a violation" of these seatbelt laws, &#167; 543.001, although it permits police to issue citations in lieu of arrest, &#167;&#167; 543.003-543.005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 1997, petitioner Gail Atwater was driving her pickup truck in Lago Vista, Texas, with her 3-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter in the front seat. None of them was &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*324&lt;/span&gt; wearing a seatbelt. Respondent Bart Turek, a Lago Vista police officer at the time, observed the seatbelt violations and pulled Atwater over. According to Atwater's complaint (the allegations of which we assume to be true for present purposes), Turek approached the truck and "yell[ed]" something to the effect of "[w]e've met before" and "[y]ou're going to jail." App. 20.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; He then called for backup and asked to see Atwater's driver's license and insurance documentation, which state law required her to carry. Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &#167;&#167; 521.025, 601.053 (1999). When Atwater told Turek that she did not have the papers because her purse had been stolen the day before, Turek said that he had "heard that story two-hundred times." App. 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atwater asked to take her "frightened, upset, and crying" children to a friend's house nearby, but Turek told her, "[y]ou're not going anywhere." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; As it turned out, Atwater's friend learned what was going on and soon arrived to take charge of the children. Turek then handcuffed Atwater, placed her in his squad car, and drove her to the local police station, where booking officers had her remove her shoes, jewelry, and eyeglasses, and empty her pockets. Officers took Atwater's "mug shot" and placed her, alone, in a jail cell for about one hour, after which she was taken before a magistrate and released on $310 bond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atwater was charged with driving without her seatbelt fastened, failing to secure her children in seatbelts, driving without a license, and failing to provide proof of insurance. She ultimately pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor seatbelt offenses and paid a $50 fine; the other charges were dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*325&lt;/span&gt; B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atwater and her husband, petitioner Michael Haas, filed suit in a Texas state court under 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1983 against Turek and respondents City of Lago Vista and Chief of Police Frank Miller. So far as concerns us, petitioners (whom we will simply call Atwater) alleged that respondents (for simplicity, the City) had violated Atwater's Fourth Amendment "right to be free from unreasonable seizure," App. 23, and sought compensatory and punitive damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City removed the suit to the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Given Atwater's admission that she had "violated the law" and the absence of any allegation "that she was harmed or detained in any way inconsistent with the law," the District Court ruled the Fourth Amendment claim "meritless" and granted the City's summary judgment motion. No. A-97 CA 679 SS (WD Tex., Feb. 13, 1999), App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a&#151;63a. A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed. 165 F. 3d 380 (1999). It concluded that "an arrest for a first-time seat belt offense" was an unreasonable seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 387, and held that Turek was not entitled to qualified immunity, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 389.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting en banc, the Court of Appeals vacated the panel's decision and affirmed the District Court's summary judgment for the City. 195 F. 3d 242 (CA5 1999). Relying on &lt;i&gt;Whren&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S. 806 (1996), the en banc court observed that, although the Fourth Amendment generally requires a balancing of individual and governmental interests, where "an arrest is based on probable cause then `with rare exceptions . . .the result of that balancing is not in doubt.' " 195 F. 3d, at 244 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Whren, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 817). Because "[n]either party dispute[d] that Officer Turek had probable cause to arrest Atwater," and because "there [was] no evidence in the record that Officer Turek conducted the arrest in an `extraordinary manner, unusually harmful' to Atwater's &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*326&lt;/span&gt; privacy interests," the en banc court held that the arrest was not unreasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes. 195 F. 3d, at 245-246 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Whren, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 818).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three judges issued dissenting opinions. On the understanding that citation is the "usual procedure" in a traffic stop situation, Judge Reynaldo Garza thought Atwater's arrest unreasonable, since there was no particular reason for taking her into custody. 195 F. 3d, at 246-247. Judge Weiner likewise believed that "even with probable cause, [an] officer must have a plausible, articulable reason" for making a custodial arrest. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 251. Judge Dennis understood the Fourth Amendment to have incorporated an earlier, common-law prohibition on warrantless arrests for misdemeanors that do not amount to or involve a "breach of the peace." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We granted certiorari to consider whether the Fourth Amendment, either by incorporating common-law restrictions on misdemeanor arrests or otherwise, limits police officers' authority to arrest without warrant for minor criminal offenses. 530 U. S. 1260 (2000). We now affirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fourth Amendment safeguards "[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures." In reading the Amendment, we are guided by "the traditional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures afforded by the common law at the time of the framing," &lt;i&gt;Wilson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arkansas,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S. 927, 931 (1995), since "[a]n examination of the common-law understanding of an officer's authority to arrest sheds light on the obviously relevant, if not entirely dispositive, consideration of what the Framers of the Amendment might have thought to be reasonable," &lt;i&gt;Payton&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York,&lt;/i&gt; 445 U. S. 573, 591 (1980) (footnote omitted). Thus, the first step here is to assess Atwater's claim that peace officers' authority to make warrantless arrests for misdemeanors was &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*327&lt;/span&gt; restricted at common law (whether "common law" is understood strictly as law judicially derived or, instead, as the whole body of law extant at the time of the framing). Atwater's specific contention is that "founding-era common-law rules" forbade peace officers to make warrantless misdemeanor arrests except in cases of "breach of the peace," a category she claims was then understood narrowly as covering only those nonfelony offenses "involving or tending toward violence." Brief for Petitioners 13. Although her historical argument is by no means insubstantial, it ultimately fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin with the state of pre-founding English common law and find that, even after making some allowance for variations in the common-law usage of the term "breach of the peace,"&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; the "founding-era common-law rules" were not &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*328&lt;/span&gt; nearly as clear as Atwater claims; on the contrary, the common-law commentators (as well as the sparsely reported cases) reached divergent conclusions with respect to officers' warrantless misdemeanor arrest power. Moreover, in the years leading up to American independence, Parliament repeatedly extended express warrantless arrest authority to cover misdemeanor-level offenses not amounting to or involving any violent breach of the peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atwater's historical argument begins with our quotation from Halsbury in &lt;i&gt;Carroll&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 267 U. S. 132 (1925), that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"`[i]n cases of misdemeanor, a peace officer like a private person has at common law no power of arresting without a warrant except when a breach of the peace has been committed in his presence or there is reasonable ground for supposing that a breach of peace is about to be committed or renewed in his presence.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 157 (quoting 9 Halsbury, Laws of England &#167; 612, p. 299 (1909)).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*329&lt;/span&gt; But the isolated quotation tends to mislead. In &lt;i&gt;Carroll&lt;/i&gt; itself we spoke of the common-law rule as only "sometimes expressed" that way, 267 U. S., at 157, and, indeed, in the very same paragraph, we conspicuously omitted any reference to a breach-of-the-peace limitation in stating that the "usual rule" at common law was that "a police officer [could] arrest without warrant . . . one guilty of a misdemeanor if committed in his presence." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 156-157. Thus, what &lt;i&gt;Carroll&lt;/i&gt; illustrates, and what others have recognized, is that statements about the common law of warrantless misdemeanor arrest simply are not uniform. Rather, "[a]t common law there is a difference of opinion among the authorities as to whether this right to arrest [without a warrant] extends to all misdemeanors." American Law Institute, Code of Criminal Procedure, Commentary to &#167; 21, p. 231 (1930).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one side of the divide there are certainly eminent authorities supporting Atwater's position. In addition to Lord Halsbury, quoted in &lt;i&gt;Carroll,&lt;/i&gt; James Fitzjames Stephen and Glanville Williams both seemed to indicate that the common law confined warrantless misdemeanor arrests to actual breaches of the peace. See 1 J. Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England 193 (1883) ("The common law did not authorise the arrest of persons guilty or suspected of misdemeanours, except in cases of an actual breach of the peace either by an affray or by violence to an individual"); G. Williams, Arrest for Breach of the Peace, 1954 Crim. L. Rev. 578, 578 ("Apart from arrest for felony . . . , the only power of arrest at common law is in respect of breach of the peace"). See also &lt;i&gt;Queen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tooley,&lt;/i&gt; 2 Ld. Raym. 1296, 1301, 92 Eng. Rep. 349, 352 (Q. B. 1710) ("[A] constable cannot arrest, but when he sees an actual breach of the peace; and if the affray be over, he cannot arrest").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sir William Blackstone and Sir Edward East might also be counted on Atwater's side, although they spoke only to the sufficiency of breach of the peace as a condition to warrantless &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*330&lt;/span&gt; misdemeanor arrest, not to its necessity. Blackstone recognized that at common law "[t]he constable . . . hath great original and inherent authority with regard to arrests," but with respect to nonfelony offenses said only that "[h]e may, without warrant, arrest any one for a breach of the peace, and carry him before a justice of the peace." 4 Blackstone 289. Not long after the framing of the Fourth Amendment, East characterized peace officers' common-law arrest power in much the same way: "A constable or other known conservator of the peace may lawfully interpose upon his own view to prevent a breach of the peace, or to quiet an affray . . . ." 1 E. East, Pleas of the Crown &#167; 71, p. 303 (1803).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great commentators were not unanimous, however, and there is also considerable evidence of a broader conception of common-law misdemeanor arrest authority unlimited by any breach-of-the-peace condition. Sir Matthew Hale, Chief Justice of King's Bench from 1671 to 1676,&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; wrote in his History of the Pleas of the Crown that, by his "original and inherent power," a constable could arrest without a warrant "for breach of the peace and some misdemeanors, less than felony." 2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 88 (1736). Hale's view, posthumously published in 1736, reflected an understanding dating back at least 60 years before the appearance of his Pleas yet sufficiently authoritative to sustain a momentum extending well beyond the framing era in this country. See The Compleat Parish-Officer 11 (1744) ("[T]he Constable . . . may for Breach of the Peace, and some Misdemeanors less than Felony, imprison a Man"); R. Burn, The Justice of the Peace 271 (1837) ("A &lt;i&gt;constable&lt;/i&gt; . . . may at common law, for treason, felony, breach of the peace, and some misdemeanors less than felony, &lt;i&gt;committed in his view,&lt;/i&gt; apprehend the supposed offender without any warrant" (italics in original)); 1 J. Chitty, A Practical &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*331&lt;/span&gt; Treatise on the Criminal Law 20 (5th ed. 1847) ("[A constable] may for treason, felony, breach of the peace, and some misdemeanors less than felony, committed in his view, apprehend the supposed offender &lt;i&gt;virtiute officii,&lt;/i&gt; without any warrant"); 1 W. Russell, Crimes and Misdemeanors 725 (7th ed. 1909) (officer "may arrest any person who in his presence commits a misdemeanor or breach of the peace").&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As will be seen later, the view of warrantless arrest authority as extending to at least "some misdemeanors" beyond breaches of the peace was undoubtedly informed by statutory provisions authorizing such arrests, but it reflected common law in the strict, judge-made sense as well, for such was the holding of at least one case reported before Hale had even become a judge but which, like Hale's own commentary, continued to be cited well after the ratification of the Fourth Amendment. In &lt;i&gt;Holyday&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Oxenbridge,&lt;/i&gt; Cro. Car. 234, 79 Eng. Rep. 805 (1631), the Court of King's Bench held that even a private person (and thus &lt;i&gt;a fortiori&lt;/i&gt; a peace officer&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;) needed no warrant to arrest a "common cheater" whom he discovered "cozen[ing] with false dice." The court expressly rejected the contention that warrantless arrests were improper "unless in felony," and said instead that "there was good cause [for] staying" the gambler and, more broadly, that "it is &lt;i&gt;pro bono publico&lt;/i&gt; to stay such offenders." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 805-806. In the edition nearest to the date of the Constitution's framing, Sergeant William Hawkins's widely read Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown generalized from &lt;i&gt;Holyday&lt;/i&gt; that "from the reason of this case it seems to follow, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*332&lt;/span&gt; That the [warrantless] arrest of any other offenders . . . for offences in like manner scandalous and prejudicial to the public, may be justified." 2 Hawkins, ch. 12, &#167; 20, at 122. A number of other common-law commentaries shared Hawkins's broad reading of &lt;i&gt;Holyday.&lt;/i&gt; See The Law of Arrests 205 (2d ed. 1753) (In light of &lt;i&gt;Holyday,&lt;/i&gt; "an Arrest of an Offender . . . for any Crime prejudicial to the Publick, seems to be justifiable"); 1 T. Cunningham, A New and Complete Law Dictionary (1771) (definition of "arrest") (same); 1 G. Jacob, The Law Dictionary 129 (1st Am. ed. 1811) (same). See generally C. Greaves, Law of Arrest Without a Warrant, in The Criminal Law Consolidation Acts, p. lxiii (1870) ("&lt;i&gt;[Holyday]&lt;/i&gt; is rested upon the broad ground that `it is &lt;i&gt;pro bono publico&lt;/i&gt; to stay such offenders,' which is equally applicable to every case of misdemeanor . . . ").&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thus find disagreement, not unanimity, among both the common-law jurists and the text writers who sought to pull the cases together and summarize accepted practice. Having reviewed the relevant English decisions, as well as English and colonial American legal treatises, legal dictionaries, and procedure manuals, we simply are not convinced that Atwater's is the correct, or even necessarily the better, reading of the common-law history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*333&lt;/span&gt; 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second, and equally serious, problem for Atwater's historical argument is posed by the "divers Statutes," M. Dalton, Country Justice, ch. 170, &#167; 4, p. 582 (1727), enacted by Parliament well before this Republic's founding that authorized warrantless misdemeanor arrests without reference to violence or turmoil. Quite apart from Hale and Blackstone, the legal background of any conception of reasonableness the Fourth Amendment's Framers might have entertained would have included English statutes, some centuries old, authorizing peace officers (and even private persons) to make warrantless arrests for all sorts of relatively minor offenses unaccompanied by violence. The so-called "nightwalker" statutes are perhaps the most notable examples. From the enactment of the Statute of Winchester in 1285, through its various readoptions and until its repeal in 1827,&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; night watchmen were authorized and charged "as . . . in Times past" to "watch the Town continually all Night, from the Sun-setting unto the Sun-rising" and were directed that "if any Stranger do pass by them, he shall be arrested until Morning . . . ." 13 Edw. I, ch. 4, &#167;&#167; 5-6, 1 Statutes at Large 232-233; see also 5 Edw. III, ch. 14, 1 Statutes at Large 448 (1331) (confirming and extending the powers of watchmen). Hawkins emphasized that the Statute of Winchester "was made" not in derogation but rather "in affirmance of the common law," for "every private person may by the common law arrest any suspicious night-walker, and detain him till he give good account of himself . . . ." 2 Hawkins, ch. 13, &#167; 6, at 130. And according to Blackstone, these watchmen had virtually limitless warrantless nighttime arrest power: "Watchmen, either those appointed by the statute of Winchester . . . or such as are mere assistants to the constable, may &lt;i&gt;virtute officii&lt;/i&gt; arrest all offenders, and particularly nightwalkers, and commit them to custody till the morning." 4 Blackstone 289; see &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*334&lt;/span&gt; also 2 Hale, Pleas of the Crown, at 97 (describing broad arrest powers of watchmen even over and above those conferred by the Statute of Winchester).&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; The Statute of Winchester, moreover, empowered peace officers not only to deal with nightwalkers and other nighttime "offenders," but periodically to "make Inquiry of all Persons being lodged in the Suburbs, or in foreign Places of the Towns." On that score, the Statute provided that "if they do find any that have lodged or received any Strangers or suspicious Person, against the Peace, the Bailiffs shall do Righttherein," 13 Edw. I, ch. 4, &#167;&#167; 3-4, 1 Statutes at Large 232-233, which Hawkins understood "surely" to mean that officers could "lawfully arrest and detain any such stranger[s]," 2 Hawkins, ch. 13, &#167; 12,at 134.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor were the nightwalker statutes the only legislative sources of warrantless arrest authority absent real or threatened violence, as the parties and their &lt;i&gt;amici&lt;/i&gt; here seem to have assumed. On the contrary, following the Edwardian legislation and throughout the period leading up to the framing, Parliament repeatedly extended warrantless arrest power to cover misdemeanor-level offenses not involving any breach of the peace. One 16th-century statute, for instance, authorized peace officers to arrest persons playing "unlawful game[s]" like bowling, tennis, dice, and cards, and for good measure extended the authority beyond players to include persons "haunting" the "houses, places and alleys where such games shall be suspected to be holden, exercised, used &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*335&lt;/span&gt; or occupied." 33 Hen. VIII, ch. 9, &#167;&#167; 11-16, 5 Statutes at Large 84-85 (1541). A 17th-century act empowered "any person . . . whatsoever to seize and detain any . . . hawker, pedlar, petty chapman, or other trading person" found selling without a license. 8 &amp;amp; 9 Wm. III, ch. 25, &#167;&#167; 3, 8, 10 Statutes at Large 81-83 (1697). And 18th-century statutes authorized the warrantless arrest of "rogues, vagabonds, beggars, and other idle and disorderly persons" (defined broadly to include jugglers, palm readers, and unlicensed play actors), 17 Geo. II, ch. 5, &#167;&#167; 1-2, 5, 18 Statutes at Large 144, 145-147 (1744); "horrid" persons who "profanely swear or curse," 19 Geo. II, ch. 21, &#167; 3, 18 Statutes at Large 445 (1746); individuals obstructing "publick streets, lanes or open passages" with "pipes, butts, barrels, casks or other vessels" or an "empty cart, car, dray or other carriage," 30 Geo. II, ch. 22, &#167;&#167; 5, 13, 22 Statutes at Large 107-108, 111 (1757); and, most significantly of all given the circumstances of the case before us, negligent carriage drivers, 27 Geo. II, ch. 16, &#167; 7, 21 Statutes at Large 188 (1754). See generally S. Blackerby, The Justice of Peace: His Companion, or a Summary of all the Acts of Parliament (1723) (cataloguing statutes); S. Welch, An Essay on the Office of Constable 19-22 (1758) (describing same).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significance of these early English statutes lies not in proving that any common-law rule barring warrantless misdemeanor arrests that might have existed would have been subject to statutory override; the sovereign Parliament could of course have wiped away any judge-made rule. The point is that the statutes riddle Atwater's supposed common-law rule with enough exceptions to unsettle any contention that the law of the mother country would have left the Fourth Amendment's Framers of a view that it would necessarily have been unreasonable to arrest without warrant for a misdemeanor unaccompanied by real or threatened violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*336&lt;/span&gt; B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An examination of specifically American evidence is to the same effect. Neither the history of the framing era nor subsequent legal development indicates that the Fourth Amendment was originally understood, or has traditionally been read, to embrace Atwater's position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, Atwater has cited no particular evidence that those who framed and ratified the Fourth Amendment sought to limit peace officers' warrantless misdemeanor arrest authority to instances of actual breach of the peace, and our own review of the recent and respected compilations of framing-era documentary history has likewise failed to reveal any such design. See The Complete Bill of Rights 223&#151; 263 (N. Cogan ed. 1997) (collecting original sources); 5 The Founders' Constitution 219-244 (P. Kurland &amp;amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987) (same). Nor have we found in any of the modern historical accounts of the Fourth Amendment's adoption any substantial indication that the Framers intended such a restriction. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; L. Levy, Origins of the Bill of Rights 150-179 (1999); T. Taylor, Two Studies in Constitutional Interpretation 19-93 (1969); J. Landynski, Search and Seizure and the Supreme Court 19-48 (1966); N. Lasson, History and Development of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution 79-105 (1937); Davies, Recovering the Original Fourth Amendment, 98 Mich. L. Rev. 547 (1999); Amar, Fourth Amendment First Principles, 107 Harv. L. Rev. 757 (1994); Bradley, Constitutional Theory of the Fourth Amendment, 38 DePaul L. Rev. 817 (1989). Indeed, to the extent these modern histories address the issue, their conclusions are to the contrary. See Landynski, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 45 (Fourth Amendment arrest rules are "based on common-law practice," which "dispensed with" a warrant requirement for misdemeanors "committed in the presence of the arresting officer"); Davies, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 551 ("[T]he Framers did not address &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*337&lt;/span&gt; warrantless intrusions at all in the Fourth Amendment or in the earlier state provisions; thus, they never anticipated that `unreasonable' might be read as a standard for warrantless intrusions").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence of actual practice also counsels against Atwater's position. During the period leading up to and surrounding the framing of the Bill of Rights, colonial and state legislatures, like Parliament before them, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 333-335, regularly authorized local peace officers to make warrantless misdemeanor arrests without conditioning statutory authority on breach of the peace. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; First Laws of the State of Connecticut 214-215 (Cushing ed. 1982) (1784 compilation; exact date of Act unknown) (authorizing warrantless arrests of "all Persons unnecessarily travelling on the Sabbath or Lord's Day"); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 23 ("such as are guilty of Drunkenness, profane Swearing, Sabbath-breaking, also vagrant Persons [and] unseasonable Night-walkers"); Digest of the Laws of the State of Georgia 1755-1800, p. 411 (H. Marbury &amp;amp; W. Crawford eds. 1802) (1762 Act) (breakers of the Sabbath laws); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 252 (1764 Act) (persons "gaming . . . in any licensed public house, or other house sellingliquors"); Colonial Laws of Massachusetts 139 (1889) (1646 Act) ("such as are overtaken with drink, swearing, Sabbath breaking, Lying, vagrant persons, [and] night-walkers"); Laws of the State of New Hampshire 549 (1800) (1799 Act) (persons "travelling unnecessarily" on Sunday); Digest of the Laws of New Jersey 1709-1838, pp. 585-586 (L. Elmer ed. 1838) (1799 Act) ("vagrants or vagabonds, common drunkards, common night-walkers, and common prostitutes," as well as fortunetellers and other practitioners of "crafty science"); Laws of the State of New York, 1777-1784, pp. 358-359 (1886) (1781 Act) ("hawker[s]" and "pedlar[s]"); Earliest Printed Laws of New York, 1665-1693, p. 133 (J. Cushing ed. 1978) (Duke of York's Laws, 1665-1675) ("such as are overtaken with Drink, Swearing, Sabbath breaking, Vagrant persons or night walkers"); 3 Laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 177-183 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*338&lt;/span&gt; (1810) (1794 Act) (persons "profanely curs[ing]," drinking excessively, "cock-fighting," or "play[ing] at cards, dice, billiards, bowls, shuffle-boards, or any game of hazard or address, for money").&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we have here, then, is just the opposite of what we had in &lt;i&gt;Wilson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arkansas&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; There, we emphasized that during the founding era a number of States had "enacted statutes specifically embracing" the common-law knock-andannounce rule, 514 U. S., at 933; here, by contrast, those very same States passed laws extending warrantless arrest authority to a host of nonviolent misdemeanors, and in so doing acted very much inconsistently with Atwater's claims about the Fourth Amendment's object. Of course, the Fourth &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*339&lt;/span&gt; Amendment did not originally apply to the States, see &lt;i&gt;Barron&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mayor of Baltimore,&lt;/i&gt; 7 Pet. 243 (1833), but that does not make state practice irrelevant in unearthing the Amendment's original meaning. A number of state constitutional search-and-seizure provisions served as models for the Fourth Amendment, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; N. H. Const. of 1784, pt. I, Art. XIX; Pa. Const. of 1776 (Declaration of Rights), Art. X, and the fact that many of the original States with such constitutional limitations continued to grant their own peace officers broad warrantless misdemeanor arrest authority undermines Atwater's contention that the founding generation meant to bar federal law enforcement officers from exercising the same authority. Given the early state practice, it is likewise troublesome for Atwater's view that just one year after the ratification of the Fourth Amendment, Congress vested federal marshals with "the same powers in executing the laws of the United States, as sheriffs and their deputies in the several states have by law, in executing the laws of their respective states." Act of May 2, 1792, ch. 28, &#167; 9, 1 Stat. 265. Thus, as we have said before in only slightly different circumstances, the Second Congress apparently "saw no inconsistency between the Fourth Amendment and legislation giving United States marshals the same power as local peace officers" to make warrantless arrests. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Watson,&lt;/i&gt; 423 U. S. 411, 420 (1976).&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The record thus supports Justice Powell's observation that "[t]here is no historical evidence that the Framers or proponents of the Fourth Amendment, outspokenly opposed to the infamous general warrants and writs of assistance, were at &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*340&lt;/span&gt; all concerned about warrantless arrests by local constables and other peace officers." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 429 (concurring opinion). We simply cannot conclude that the Fourth Amendment, as originally understood, forbade peace officers to arrest without a warrant for misdemeanors not amounting to or involving breach of the peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor does Atwater's argument from tradition pick up any steam from the historical record as it has unfolded since the framing, there being no indication that her claimed rule has ever become "woven . . . into the fabric" of American law. &lt;i&gt;Wilson, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 933; see also &lt;i&gt;Payton&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York,&lt;/i&gt; 445 U. S., at 590 (emphasizing "the clear consensus among the States adhering to [a] well-settled common-law rule"). The story, on the contrary, is of two centuries of uninterrupted (and largely unchallenged) state and federal practice permitting warrantless arrests for misdemeanors not amounting to or involving breach of the peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there is no support for Atwater's position in this Court's cases (apart from the isolated sentence in &lt;i&gt;Carroll,&lt;/i&gt;  already explained). Although the Court has not had much to say about warrantless misdemeanor arrest authority, what little we have said tends to cut against Atwater's argument. In discussing this authority, we have focused on the circumstance that an offense was committed in an officer's presence, to the omission of any reference to a breach-of-the-peace limitation.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Watson, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 418 ("The cases construing the Fourth Amendment thus reflect the ancient common-law rule that a peace officer was permitted to arrest without a warrant for a misdemeanor or felony &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*341&lt;/span&gt; committed in his presence . . ."); &lt;i&gt;Carroll,&lt;/i&gt; 267 U. S., at 156&#151; 157 ("The usual rule is that a police officer may arrest without warrant one . . . guilty of a misdemeanor if committed in his presence"); &lt;i&gt;Bad Elk&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 177 U. S. 529, 534, 536, n. 1 (1900) (noting common-law pedigree of state statute permitting warrantless arrest "[f]or a public offense committed or attempted in [officer's] presence"); &lt;i&gt;Kurtz&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Moffitt,&lt;/i&gt;  115 U. S. 487, 499 (1885) (common-law presence requirement); cf. also &lt;i&gt;Welsh&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin,&lt;/i&gt; 466 U. S. 740, 756 (1984) (White, J., dissenting) ("`[A]uthority to arrest without a warrant in misdemeanor cases may be enlarged by statute' ").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, and again in contrast with &lt;i&gt;Wilson,&lt;/i&gt; it is not the case here that "[e]arly American courts . . .embraced" an accepted common-law rule with anything approaching unanimity. &lt;i&gt;Wilson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arkansas,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S., at 933. To be sure, Atwater has cited several 19th-century decisions that, at least at first glance, might seem to support her contention that "warrantless misdemeanor arrest was unlawful when not [for] a breach of the peace." Brief for Petitioners 17 (citing &lt;i&gt;Pow&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Beckner,&lt;/i&gt; 3 Ind. 475, 478 (1852), &lt;i&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Carey,&lt;/i&gt; 66 Mass. 246, 250 (1853), and &lt;i&gt;Robison&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Miner,&lt;/i&gt;  68 Mich. 549, 556-559, 37 N. W. 21, 25 (1888)). But none is ultimately availing. &lt;i&gt;Pow&lt;/i&gt; is fundamentally a "presence" case; it stands only for the proposition, not at issue here, see n. 11, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; that a nonfelony arrest should be made while the offense is "in [the officer's] view and . . . still continuing" and not subsequently "upon vague information communicated to him." 3 Ind., at 478. The language Atwater attributes to &lt;i&gt;Carey&lt;/i&gt; ("[E]ven if he were a constable, he had no power to arrest for any misdemeanor without a warrant, except to stay a breach of the peace, or to prevent the commission of such an offense") is taken from the reporter's summary of one of the party's arguments, not from the opinion of the court. While the court in &lt;i&gt;Carey&lt;/i&gt; (through Chief Justice Shaw) said that "the old established rule of the common law" was that "a constable or other peace officer could not &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*342&lt;/span&gt; arrest one without a warrant . . . if such crime were not an offence amounting in law to felony," it said just as clearly that the common-law rule could be "altered by the legislature" (notwithstanding Massachusetts's own Fourth Amendment equivalent in its State Constitution). 66 Mass., at 252. &lt;i&gt;Miner,&lt;/i&gt; the third and final case upon which Atwater relies, was expressly overruled just six years after it was decided. In &lt;i&gt;Burroughs&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Eastman,&lt;/i&gt; 101 Mich. 419, 59 N. W. 817 (1894), the Supreme Court of Michigan held that the language from &lt;i&gt;Miner&lt;/i&gt; upon which the plaintiff there (and presumably Atwater here) relied "should not be followed," and then went on to offer the following: "[T]he question has arisen in many of our sister states, and the power to authorize arrest on view for offenses not amounting to breaches of the peace has been affirmed. Our attention has been called to no case, nor have we in our research found one, in which the contrary doctrine has been asserted." 101 Mich., at 425, 59 N. W., at 819 (collecting cases from, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, and Texas).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reports may well contain early American cases more favorable to Atwater's position than the ones she has herself invoked. But more to the point, we think, are the numerous early- and mid-19th-century decisions expressly sustaining (often against constitutional challenge) state and local laws authorizing peace officers to make warrantless arrests for misdemeanors not involving any breach of the peace. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mayo&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wilson,&lt;/i&gt; 1 N. H. 53 (1817) (upholding statute authorizing warrantless arrests of those unnecessarily traveling on Sunday against challenge based on state due process and search-and-seizure provisions); &lt;i&gt;Holcomb&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cornish,&lt;/i&gt; 8 Conn. 375 (1831) (upholding statute permitting warrantless arrests for "drunkenness, profane swearing, cursing or sabbath-breaking" against argument that "[t]he power of a justice of the peace to arrest and detain a citizen without complaint or warrant against him, is surely not given by the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*343&lt;/span&gt; common law"); &lt;i&gt;Jones&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Root,&lt;/i&gt; 72 Mass. 435 (1856) (rebuffing constitutional challenge to statute authorizing officers "without a warrant [to] arrest any person or persons whom they may find in the act of illegally selling, transporting, or distributing intoxicating liquors"); &lt;i&gt;Main&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McCarty,&lt;/i&gt; 15 Ill. 441, 442 (1854) (concluding that a law expressly authorizing arrests for city-ordinance violations was "not repugnant to the constitution or the general provisions of law"); &lt;i&gt;White&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kent,&lt;/i&gt;  11 Ohio St. 550 (1860) (upholding municipal ordinance permitting warrantless arrest of any person found violating any city ordinance or state law); &lt;i&gt;Davis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Soc. for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,&lt;/i&gt; 75 N. Y. 362 (1878) (upholding statute permitting warrantless arrest for misdemeanor violation of cruelty-to-animals prohibition). See generally Wilgus, Arrest Without a Warrant, 22 Mich. L. Rev. 541, 550, and n. 54 (1924) (collecting cases and observing that "[t]he states may, by statute, enlarge the common law right to arrest without a warrant, and have quite generally done so or authorized municipalities to do so, as for example, an officer may be authorized by statute or ordinance to arrest without a warrant for various misdemeanors and violations of ordinances, other than breaches of the peace, if committed in his presence"); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 706, nn. 570, 571 (collecting cases); 1 J. Bishop, New Criminal Procedure &#167;&#167; 181, 183, pp. 101, n. 2, 103, n. 5 (4th ed. 1895) (same); W. Clark, Handbook of Criminal Procedure &#167; 12, p. 50, n. 8 (2d ed. 1918) (same).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, both the legislative tradition of granting warrantless misdemeanor arrest authority and the judicial tradition of sustaining such statutes against constitutional attack are buttressed by legal commentary that, for more than a century now, has almost uniformly recognized the constitutionality of extending warrantless arrest power to misdemeanors without limitation to breaches of the peace. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; E. Fisher, Laws of Arrest &#167; 59, p. 130 (1967) ("[I]t is generally recognized today that the common law authority to arrest without a warrant in misdemeanor cases may be enlarged by &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*344&lt;/span&gt; statute, and this has been done in many of the states"); Wilgus, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 705-706 ("Statutes and municipal charters have quite generally authorized an officer to arrest for any misdemeanor whether a breach of the peace or not, without a warrant, if committed in the officer's presence. Such statutes are valid" (footnote omitted)); Clark, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; &#167; 12, at 50 ("In most, if not all, the states there are statutes and city ordinances, which are clearly valid, authorizing officers to arrest for certain misdemeanors without a warrant, when committed in their presence"); J. Beale, Criminal Pleading and Practice &#167; 21, p. 20, and n. 7 (1899) ("By statute the power of peace officers to arrest without a warrant is often extended to all misdemeanors committed in their presence." "Such a statute is constitutional"); 1 Bishop, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; &#167; 183, at 103 ("[T]he power of arrest extends, possibly, to any indictable wrong in [an officer's] presence. . . . And statutes and ordinances widely permit these arrests for violations of municipal by-laws"); J. Bassett, Criminal Pleading and Practice &#167; 89, p. 104 (2d ed. 1885) ("[A]s to the lesser misdemeanors, except breaches of the peace, the power extends only so far as some statute gives it"). But cf. H. Vorhees, Law of Arrest &#167; 131, pp. 78-79 (1904) (acknowledging that "by authority of statute, city charter, or ordinance, [an officer] may arrest without a warrant, one who . . . commits a misdemeanor other than a breach of the peace," but suggesting that courts look with "disfavor" on such legislative enactments "as interfering with the constitutional liberties of the subject").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small wonder, then, that today statutes in all 50 States and the District of Columbia permit warrantless misdemeanor arrests by at least some (if not all) peace officers without requiring any breach of the peace,&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt; as do a host of congressional enactments.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt; The American Law Institute &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*345&lt;/span&gt; has long endorsed the validity of such legislation, see American Law Institute, Code of Criminal Procedure &#167; 21(a), p. 28 (1930); American Law Institute, Model Code of PreArraignment Procedure &#167; 120.1(1)(c), p. 13 (1975), and the consensus, as stated in the current literature, is that statutes "remov[ing] the breach of the peace limitation and thereby permit[ting] arrest without warrant for &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; misdemeanor committed in the arresting officer's presence" have "`never been successfully challenged and stan[d] as the law of the land.' " 3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure &#167; 5.1(b), pp. 13-14, and n. 76 (1996) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Higbee&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;San Diego,&lt;/i&gt; 911 F. 2d 377, 379 (CA9 1990)) (emphasis in original; footnote omitted). This, therefore, simply is not a case in which the claimant can point to "a clear answer [that] existed in 1791 and has been generally adhered to by the traditions of our society ever since." &lt;i&gt;County of Riverside&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McLaughlin,&lt;/i&gt; 500 U. S. 44, 60 (1991) (Scalia, J., dissenting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is true here that history, if not unequivocal, has expressed a decided, majority view that the police need not obtain an arrest warrant merely because a misdemeanor stopped short of violence or a threat of it, Atwater does not wager all on history.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; Instead, she asks us to mint a new &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*346&lt;/span&gt; rule of constitutional law on the understanding that when historical practice fails to speak conclusively to a claim grounded on the Fourth Amendment, courts are left to strike a current balance between individual and societal interests by subjecting particular contemporary circumstances to traditional standards of reasonableness. See &lt;i&gt;Wyoming&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Houghton,&lt;/i&gt; 526 U. S. 295, 299-300 (1999); &lt;i&gt;Vernonia School Dist. 47J&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Acton,&lt;/i&gt; 515 U. S. 646, 652-653 (1995). Atwater accordingly argues for a modern arrest rule, one not necessarily requiring violent breach of the peace, but nonetheless forbidding custodial arrest, even upon probable cause, when conviction could not ultimately carry any jail time and when the government shows no compelling need for immediate detention.&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to derive a rule exclusively to address the uncontested facts of this case, Atwater might well prevail. She was a known and established resident of Lago Vista with no place to hide and no incentive to flee, and common sense says she would almost certainly have buckled up as a condition of driving off with a citation. In her case, the physical incidents of arrest were merely gratuitous humiliations imposed by a police officer who was (at best) exercising &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*347&lt;/span&gt; extremely poor judgment. Atwater's claim to live free of pointless indignity and confinement clearly outweighs anything the City can raise against it specific to her case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have traditionally recognized that a responsible Fourth Amendment balance is not well served by standards requiring sensitive, case-by-case determinations of government need, lest every discretionary judgment in the field be converted into an occasion for constitutional review. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Robinson,&lt;/i&gt; 414 U. S. 218, 234-235 (1973). Often enough, the Fourth Amendment has to be applied on the spur (and in the heat) of the moment, and the object in implementing its command of reasonableness is to draw standards sufficiently clear and simple to be applied with a fair prospect of surviving judicial second-guessing months and years after an arrest or search is made. Courts attempting to strike a reasonable Fourth Amendment balance thus credit the government's side with an essential interest in readily administrable rules. See &lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Belton,&lt;/i&gt; 453 U. S. 454, 458 (1981) (Fourth Amendment rules "`ought to be expressed in terms that are readily applicable by the police in the context of the law enforcement activities in which they are necessarily engaged' " and not "`qualified by all sorts of ifs, ands, and buts' ").&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, Atwater's argument may seem to respect the values of clarity and simplicity, so far as she claims that the Fourth Amendment generally forbids warrantless arrests for minor crimes not accompanied by violence or some &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*348&lt;/span&gt; demonstrable threat of it (whether "minor crime" be defined as a fine-only traffic offense, a fine-only offense more generally, or a misdemeanor&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt;). But the claim is not ultimately so simple, nor could it be, for complications arise the moment we begin to think about the possible applications of the several criteria Atwater proposes for drawing a line between minor crimes with limited arrest authority and others not so restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One line, she suggests, might be between "jailable" and "fine-only" offenses, between those for which conviction could result in commitment and those for which it could not. The trouble with this distinction, of course, is that an officer on the street might not be able to tell. It is not merely that we cannot expect every police officer to know the details of frequently complex penalty schemes, see &lt;i&gt;Berkemer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McCarty,&lt;/i&gt; 468 U. S. 420, 431, n. 13 (1984) ("[O]fficers in the field frequently `have neither the time nor the competence to determine' the severity of the offense for which they are considering arresting a person"), but that penalties for ostensibly identical conduct can vary on account of facts difficult (if not impossible) to know at the scene of an arrest. Is this the first offense or is the suspect a repeat offender?&lt;sup&gt;[18]&lt;/sup&gt; Is the weight of the marijuana a gram above or a gram below &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*349&lt;/span&gt; the fine-only line?&lt;sup&gt;[19]&lt;/sup&gt; Where conduct could implicate more than one criminal prohibition, which one will the district attorney ultimately decide to charge?&lt;sup&gt;[20]&lt;/sup&gt; And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Atwater's refinements would not end there. She represents that if the line were drawn at nonjailable traffic offenses, her proposed limitation should be qualified by a proviso authorizing warrantless arrests where "necessary for enforcement of the traffic laws or when [an] offense would otherwise continue and pose a danger to others on the road." Brief for Petitioners 46 (internal quotation marks omitted). (Were the line drawn at misdemeanors generally, a comparable qualification would presumably apply.) The proviso only compounds the difficulties. Would, for instance, either exception apply to speeding? At oral argument, Atwater's counsel said that "it would not be reasonable to arrest a driver for speeding unless the speeding rose to the level of reckless driving." Tr. of Oral Arg. 16. But is it not fair to expect that the chronic speeder will speed again despite a citation in his pocket, and should that not qualify as showing that the "offense would . . . continue" under Atwater's rule? And why, as a constitutional matter, should we assume that only reckless driving will "pose a danger to others on the road" while speeding will not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*350&lt;/span&gt; There is no need for more examples to show that Atwater's general rule and limiting proviso promise very little in the way of administrability. It is no answer that the police routinely make judgments on grounds like risk of immediate repetition; they surely do and should. But there is a world of difference between making that judgment in choosing between the discretionary leniency of a summons in place of a clearly lawful arrest, and making the same judgment when the question is the lawfulness of the warrantless arrest itself. It is the difference between no basis for legal action challenging the discretionary judgment, on the one hand, and the prospect of evidentiary exclusion or (as here) personal &#167; 1983 liability for the misapplication of a constitutional standard, on the other. Atwater's rule therefore would not only place police in an almost impossible spot but would guarantee increased litigation over many of the arrests that would occur.&lt;sup&gt;[21]&lt;/sup&gt; For all these reasons, Atwater's various distinctions between permissible and impermissible arrests for minor crimes strike us as "very unsatisfactory line[s]" to require police officers to draw on a moment's notice. &lt;i&gt;Carroll&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 267 U. S., at 157.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One may ask, of course, why these difficulties may not be answered by a simple tie breaker for the police to follow in the field: if in doubt, do not arrest. The first answer is that in practice the tie breaker would boil down to something akin to a least-restrictive-alternative limitation, which is itself one of those "ifs, ands, and buts" rules, &lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Belton,&lt;/i&gt; 453 U. S., at 458, generally thought inappropriate in working out Fourth Amendment protection. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Skinner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Railway Labor Executives' Assn.,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 602, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*351&lt;/span&gt; 629, n. 9 (1989) (collecting cases); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;MartinezFuerte,&lt;/i&gt; 428 U. S. 543, 557-558, n. 12 (1976) ("The logic of such elaborate less-restrictive-alternative arguments could raise insuperable barriers to the exercise of virtually all searchand-seizure powers"). Beyond that, whatever help the tie breaker might give would come at the price of a systematic disincentive to arrest in situations where even Atwater concedes that arresting would serve an important societal interest. An officer not quite sure that the drugs weighed enough to warrant jail time or not quite certain about a suspect's risk of flight would not arrest, even though it could perfectly well turn out that, in fact, the offense called for incarceration and the defendant was long gone on the day of trial. Multiplied many times over, the costs to society of such under enforcement could easily outweigh the costs to defendants of being needlessly arrested and booked, as Atwater herself acknowledges.&lt;sup&gt;[22]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just how easily the costs could outweigh the benefits may be shown by asking, as one Member of this Court did at oral argument, "how bad the problem is out there." Tr. of Oral Arg. 20. The very fact that the law has never jelled the way Atwater would have it leads one to wonder whether warrantless misdemeanor arrests need constitutional attention, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*352&lt;/span&gt; and there is cause to think the answer is no. So far as such arrests might be thought to pose a threat to the probable-cause requirement, anyone arrested for a crime without formal process, whether for felony or misdemeanor, is entitled to a magistrate's review of probable cause within 48 hours, &lt;i&gt;County of Riverside&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McLaughlin,&lt;/i&gt; 500 U. S., at 55-58, and there is no reason to think the procedure in this case atypical in giving the suspect a prompt opportunity to request release, see Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &#167; 543.002 (1999) (persons arrested for traffic offenses to be taken "immediately" before a magistrate). Many jurisdictions, moreover, have chosen to impose more restrictive safeguards through statutes limiting warrantless arrests for minor offenses. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Ala. Code &#167; 32-1&#151;4 (1999); Cal. Veh. Code Ann. &#167; 40504 (West 2000); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &#167;&#167; 431.015(1), (2) (Michie 1999); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &#167; 32:391 (West 1989); Md. Transp. Code Ann. &#167; 26-202(a)(2) (1999); S. D. Codified Laws &#167; 32-33-2 (1998); Tenn. Code Ann. &#167; 40-7&#151;118(b)(1) (1997); Va. Code Ann. &#167; 46.2-936 (Supp. 2000). It is of course easier to devise a minor-offense limitation by statute than to derive one through the Constitution, simply because the statute can let the arrest power turn on any sort of practical consideration without having to subsume it under a broader principle. It is, in fact, only natural that States should resort to this sort of legislative regulation, for, as Atwater's own &lt;i&gt;amici&lt;/i&gt;  emphasize, it is in the interest of the police to limit pettyoffense arrests, which carry costs that are simply too great to incur without good reason. See Brief for Institute on Criminal Justice at the University of Minnesota Law School and Eleven Leading Experts on Law Enforcement and Corrections Administration and Policy as &lt;i&gt;Amici Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 11 (the use of custodial arrests for minor offenses "[a]ctually [c]ontradicts [l]aw [e]nforcement [i]nterests"). Finally, and significantly, under current doctrine the preference for categorical treatment of Fourth Amendment claims gives way to individualized review when a defendant makes a colorable &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*353&lt;/span&gt; argument that an arrest, with or without a warrant, was "conducted in an extraordinary manner, unusually harmful to [his] privacy or even physical interests." &lt;i&gt;Whren&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S., at 818; see also &lt;i&gt;Graham&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Connor,&lt;/i&gt;  490 U. S. 386, 395-396 (1989) (excessive force actionable under &#167; 1983).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upshot of all these influences, combined with the good sense (and, failing that, the political accountability) of most local lawmakers and law-enforcement officials, is a dearth of horribles demanding redress. Indeed, when Atwater's counsel was asked at oral argument for any indications of comparably foolish, warrantless misdemeanor arrests, he could offer only one.&lt;sup&gt;[23]&lt;/sup&gt; We are sure that there are others,&lt;sup&gt;[24]&lt;/sup&gt; but just as surely the country is not confronting anything like an epidemic of unnecessary minor-offense arrests.&lt;sup&gt;[25]&lt;/sup&gt; That fact caps the reasons for rejecting Atwater's request &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*354&lt;/span&gt; for the development of a new and distinct body of constitutional law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, we confirm today what our prior cases have intimated: the standard of probable cause "applie[s] to all arrests, without the need to `balance' the interests and circumstances involved in particular situations." &lt;i&gt;Dunaway&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York,&lt;/i&gt; 442 U. S. 200, 208 (1979). If an officer has probable cause to believe that an individual has committed even a very minor criminal offense in his presence, he may, without violating the Fourth Amendment, arrest the offender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atwater's arrest satisfied constitutional requirements. There is no dispute that Officer Turek had probable cause to believe that Atwater had committed a crime in his presence. She admits that neither she nor her children were wearing seatbelts, as required by Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &#167; 545.413 (1999). Turek was accordingly authorized (not required, but authorized) to make a custodial arrest without balancing costs and benefits or determining whether or not Atwater's arrest was in some sense necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor was the arrest made in an "extraordinary manner, unusually harmful to [her] privacy or . . . physical interests." &lt;i&gt;Whren&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S., at 818. As our citations in &lt;i&gt;Whren&lt;/i&gt; make clear, the question whether a search or seizure is "extraordinary" turns, above all else, on the manner in which the search or seizure is executed. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; (citing &lt;i&gt;Tennessee&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Garner,&lt;/i&gt; 471 U. S. 1 (1985) ("seizure by means of deadly force"), &lt;i&gt;Wilson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arkansas,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S. 927 (1995) ("unannounced entry into a home"), &lt;i&gt;Welsh&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin,&lt;/i&gt; 466 U. S. 740 (1984) ("entry into a home without a warrant"), and &lt;i&gt;Winston&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lee,&lt;/i&gt; 470 U. S. 753 (1985) ("physical penetration of the body")). Atwater's arrest was surely "humiliating," as she says in her brief, but it was no more "harmful to . . . privacy or . . . physical interests" than the normal custodial arrest. She was handcuffed, placed in a squad car, and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*355&lt;/span&gt; taken to the local police station, where officers asked her to remove her shoes, jewelry, and glasses, and to empty her pockets. They then took her photograph and placed her in a cell, alone, for about an hour, after which she was taken before a magistrate, and released on $310 bond. The arrest and booking were inconvenient and embarrassing to Atwater, but not so extraordinary as to violate the Fourth Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals's en banc judgment is affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fourth Amendment guarantees the right to be free from "unreasonable searches and seizures." The Court recognizes that the arrest of Gail Atwater was a "pointless indignity" that served no discernible state interest, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 347, and yet holds that her arrest was constitutionally permissible. Because the Court's position is inconsistent with the explicit guarantee of the Fourth Amendment, I dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full custodial arrest, such as the one to which Ms. Atwater was subjected, is the quintessential seizure. See &lt;i&gt;Payton&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York,&lt;/i&gt; 445 U. S. 573, 585 (1980). When a full custodial arrest is effected without a warrant, the plain language of the Fourth Amendment requires that the arrest be reasonable. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; It is beyond cavil that "[t]he touchstone of our analysis under the Fourth Amendment is always `the reasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen's personal security.' " &lt;i&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mimms,&lt;/i&gt; 434 U. S. 106, 108-109 (1977) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; (quoting &lt;i&gt;Terry&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ohio,&lt;/i&gt; 392 U. S. 1, 19 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*361&lt;/span&gt; (1968)). See also, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ramirez,&lt;/i&gt; 523 U. S. 65, 71 (1998); &lt;i&gt;Maryland&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wilson,&lt;/i&gt; 519 U. S. 408, 411 (1997); &lt;i&gt;Ohio&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Robinette,&lt;/i&gt; 519 U. S. 33, 39 (1996); &lt;i&gt;Florida&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jimeno,&lt;/i&gt;  500 U. S. 248, 250 (1991); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chadwick,&lt;/i&gt; 433 U. S. 1, 9 (1977).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have "often looked to the common law in evaluating the reasonableness, for Fourth Amendment purposes, of police activity." &lt;i&gt;Tennessee&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Garner,&lt;/i&gt; 471 U. S. 1, 13 (1985). But history is just one of the tools we use in conducting the reasonableness inquiry. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 13-19; see also &lt;i&gt;Wilson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arkansas,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S. 927, 929 (1995); &lt;i&gt;Wyoming&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Houghton,&lt;/i&gt;  526 U. S. 295, 307 (1999) (Breyer, J., concurring). And when history is inconclusive, as the majority amply demonstrates it is in this case, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 326-345, we will "evaluate the search or seizure under traditional standards of reasonableness by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual's privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests." &lt;i&gt;Wyoming&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Houghton, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 300. See also, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Skinner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Railway Labor Executives' Assn.,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 602, 619 (1989); &lt;i&gt;Tennessee&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Garner, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 8; &lt;i&gt;Delaware&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Prouse,&lt;/i&gt; 440 U. S. 648, 654 (1979); &lt;i&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mimms, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 109. In other words, in determining reasonableness, "[e]ach case is to be decided on its own facts and circumstances." &lt;i&gt;Go-Bart Importing Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 282 U. S. 344, 357 (1931).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority gives a brief nod to this bedrock principle of our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, and even acknowledges that "Atwater's claim to live free of pointless indignity and confinement clearly outweighs anything the City can raise against it specific to her case." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 347. But instead of remedying this imbalance, the majority allows itself to be swayed by the worry that "every discretionary judgment in the field [will] be converted into an occasion for constitutional review." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; It therefore mints a new rule that "[i]f an officer has probable cause to believe that an individual &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*362&lt;/span&gt; has committed even a very minor criminal offense in his presence, he may, without violating the Fourth Amendment, arrest the offender." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 354. This rule is not only unsupported by our precedent, but runs contrary to the principles that lie at the core of the Fourth Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the majority tacitly acknowledges, we have never considered the precise question presented here, namely, the constitutionality of a warrantless arrest for an offense punishable only by fine. Cf. &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Indeed, on the rare occasions that Members of this Court have contemplated such an arrest, they have indicated disapproval. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gustafson&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Florida,&lt;/i&gt; 414 U. S. 260, 266-267 (1973) (Stewart, J., concurring) ("[A] persuasive claim might have been made . . . that the custodial arrest of the petitioner for a minor traffic offense violated his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. But no such claim has been made"); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Robinson,&lt;/i&gt; 414 U. S. 218, 238, n. 2 (1973) (Powell, J., concurring) (the validity of a custodial arrest for a minor traffic offense is not "self-evident").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, we have held that the existence of probable cause is a necessary condition for an arrest. See &lt;i&gt;Dunaway&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;New York,&lt;/i&gt; 442 U. S. 200, 213-214 (1979). And in the case of felonies punishable by a term of imprisonment, we have held that the existence of probable cause is also a sufficient condition for an arrest. See &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Watson,&lt;/i&gt; 423 U. S. 411, 416-417 (1976). In &lt;i&gt;Watson,&lt;/i&gt; however, there was a clear and consistently applied common law rule permitting warrantless felony arrests. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 417-422. Accordingly, our inquiry ended there and we had no need to assess the reasonableness of such arrests by weighing individual liberty interests against state interests. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Wyoming&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Houghton, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 299-300; &lt;i&gt;Tennessee&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Garner, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 26 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (criticizing majority for disregarding undisputed common law rule).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, however, we have no such luxury. The Court's thorough exegesis makes it abundantly clear that warrantless &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*363&lt;/span&gt; misdemeanor arrests were not the subject of a clear and consistently applied rule at common law. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 332 (finding "disagreement, not unanimity, among both the common-law jurists and the text writers"); &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 335 (acknowledging that certain early English statutes serve only to "riddle Atwater's supposed common-law rule with enough exceptions to unsettle any contention [that there was a clear common-law rule barring warrantless arrests for misdemeanors that were not breaches of the peace]"). We therefore must engage in the balancing test required by the Fourth Amendment. See &lt;i&gt;Wyoming&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Houghton, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 299-300. While probable cause is surely a necessary condition for warrantless arrests for fine-only offenses, see &lt;i&gt;Dunaway&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 213-214, any realistic assessment of the interests implicated by such arrests demonstrates that probable cause alone is not a sufficient condition. See &lt;i&gt;infra,&lt;/i&gt;  at 364-366.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our decision in &lt;i&gt;Whren&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S. 806 (1996), is not to the contrary. The specific question presented there was whether, in evaluating the Fourth Amendment reasonableness of a traffic stop, the subjective intent of the police officer is a relevant consideration. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 808, 814. We held that it is not, and stated that "[t]he making of a traffic stop . . . is governed by the usual rule that probable cause to believe the law has been broken `outbalances' private interest in avoiding police contact." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 818.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We of course did not have occasion in &lt;i&gt;Whren&lt;/i&gt; to consider the constitutional preconditions for warrantless arrests for fine-only offenses. Nor should our words be taken beyond their context. There are significant qualitative differences between a traffic stop and a full custodial arrest. While both are seizures that fall within the ambit of the Fourth Amendment, the latter entails a much greater intrusion on an individual's liberty and privacy interests. As we have said, "[a] motorist's expectations, when he sees a policeman's light flashing behind him, are that he will be obliged to spend &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*364&lt;/span&gt; a short period of time answering questions and waiting while the officer checks his license and registration, that he may be given a citation, but that in the end he most likely will be allowed to continue on his way." &lt;i&gt;Berkemer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McCarty,&lt;/i&gt; 468 U. S. 420, 437 (1984). Thus, when there is probable cause to believe that a person has violated a minor traffic law, there can be little question that the state interest in law enforcement will justify the relatively limited intrusion of a traffic stop. It is by no means certain, however, that where the offense is punishable only by fine, "probable cause to believe the law has been broken [will] `outbalanc[e]' private interest in avoiding" a full custodial arrest. &lt;i&gt;Whren&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 818. Justifying a full arrest by the same quantum of evidence that justifies a traffic stop&#151;even though the offender cannot ultimately be imprisoned for her conduct&#151;defies any sense of proportionality and is in serious tension with the Fourth Amendment's proscription of unreasonable seizures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A custodial arrest exacts an obvious toll on an individual's liberty and privacy, even when the period of custody is relatively brief. The arrestee is subject to a full search of her person and confiscation of her possessions. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Robinson, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; If the arrestee is the occupant of a car, the entire passenger compartment of the car, including packages therein, is subject to search as well. See &lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Belton,&lt;/i&gt; 453 U. S. 454 (1981). The arrestee may be detained for up to 48 hours without having a magistrate determine whether there in fact was probable cause for the arrest. See &lt;i&gt;County of Riverside&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McLaughlin,&lt;/i&gt; 500 U. S. 44 (1991). Because people arrested for all types of violent and nonviolent offenses may be housed together awaiting such review, this detention period is potentially dangerous.

And once the period of custody is over, the fact of the arrest is a permanent &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*365&lt;/span&gt; part of the public record. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Paul&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Davis,&lt;/i&gt; 424 U. S. 693 (1976).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have said that "the penalty that may attach to any particular offense seems to provide the clearest and most consistent indication of the State's interest in arresting individuals suspected of committing that offense." &lt;i&gt;Welsh&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin,&lt;/i&gt; 466 U. S. 740, 754, n. 14 (1984). If the State has decided that a fine, and not imprisonment, is the appropriate punishment for an offense, the State's interest in taking a person suspected of committing that offense into custody is surely limited, at best. This is not to say that the State will never have such an interest. A full custodial arrest may on occasion vindicate legitimate state interests, even if the crime is punishable only by fine. Arrest is the surest way to abate criminal conduct. It may also allow the police to verify the offender's identity and, if the offender poses a flight risk, to ensure her appearance at trial. But when such considerations are not present, a citation or summons may serve the State's remaining law enforcement interests every bit as effectively as an arrest. Cf. Lodging for State of Texas et al. as &lt;i&gt;Amici Curiae&lt;/i&gt; (Texas Department of Public Safety, Student Handout, Traffic Law Enforcement 1 (1999)) ("Citations. . . . Definition&#151;a means of getting violators to court without physical arrest. A citation should be used when it will serve this purpose except when by issuing a citation and releasing the violator, the safety of the public and/or the violator might be imperiled as in the case of D. W. I.").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because a full custodial arrest is such a severe intrusion on an individual's liberty, its reasonableness hinges on "the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests." &lt;i&gt;Wyoming&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Houghton,&lt;/i&gt; 526 U. S., at 300. In light of the availability of citations to promote a State's interests when a fine-only offense has been committed, I cannot concur in a rule which deems a full custodial arrest to be reasonable in every circumstance. Giving police &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*366&lt;/span&gt; officers constitutional carte blanche to effect an arrest whenever there is probable cause to believe a fine-only misdemeanor has been committed is irreconcilable with the Fourth Amendment's command that seizures be reasonable. Instead, I would require that when there is probable cause to believe that a fine-only offense has been committed, the police officer should issue a citation unless the officer is "able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant [the additional] intrusion" of a full custodial arrest. &lt;i&gt;Terry&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ohio,&lt;/i&gt; 392 U. S., at 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority insists that a bright-line rule focused on probable cause is necessary to vindicate the State's interest in easily administrable law enforcement rules. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 347-351. Probable cause itself, however, is not a model of precision. "The quantum of information which constitutes probable cause&#151;evidence which would `warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief' that a [crime] has been committed&#151;must be measured by the facts of the particular case." &lt;i&gt;Wong Sun&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 371 U. S. 471, 479 (1963) (citation omitted). The rule I propose&#151;which merely requires a legitimate reason for the decision to escalate the seizure into a full custodial arrest&#151;thus does not undermine an otherwise "clear and simple" rule. Cf. &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 347.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While clarity is certainly a value worthy of consideration in our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, it by no means trumps the values of liberty and privacy at the heart of the Amendment's protections. What the &lt;i&gt;Terry&lt;/i&gt; rule lacks in precision it makes up for in fidelity to the Fourth Amendment's command of reasonableness and sensitivity to the competing values protected by that Amendment. Over the past 30 years, it appears that the &lt;i&gt;Terry&lt;/i&gt; rule has been workable and easily applied by officers on the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At bottom, the majority offers two related reasons why a bright-line rule is necessary: the fear that officers who arrest for fine-only offenses will be subject to "personal [42 U. S. C.] &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*367&lt;/span&gt; &#167; 1983 liability for the misapplication of a constitutional standard," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 350, and the resulting "systematic disincentive to arrest . . . where . . . arresting would serve an important societal interest," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 351. These concerns are certainly valid, but they are more than adequately resolved by the doctrine of qualified immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualified immunity was created to shield government officials from civil liability for the performance of discretionary functions so long as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known. See &lt;i&gt;Harlow&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fitzgerald,&lt;/i&gt; 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982). This doctrine is "the best attainable accommodation of competing values," namely, the obligation to enforce constitutional guarantees and the need to protect officials who are required to exercise their discretion. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 814.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Anderson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Creighton,&lt;/i&gt; 483 U. S. 635 (1987), we made clear that the standard of reasonableness for a search or seizure under the Fourth Amendment is distinct from the standard of reasonableness for qualified immunity purposes. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 641. If a law enforcement officer "reasonably but mistakenly conclude[s]" that the constitutional predicate for a search or seizure is present, he "should not be held personally liable." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doctrine thus allays any concerns about liability or disincentives to arrest. If, for example, an officer reasonably thinks that a suspect poses a flight risk or might be a danger to the community if released, cf. &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 351, he may arrest without fear of the legal consequences. Similarly, if an officer reasonably concludes that a suspect may possess more than four ounces of marijuana and thus might be guilty of a felony, cf. &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 348-349, and n. 19, 351, the officer will be insulated from liability for arresting the suspect even if the initial assessment turns out to be factually incorrect. As we have said, "officials will not be liable for mere mistakes in judgment." &lt;i&gt;Butz&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Economou,&lt;/i&gt; 438 U. S. 478, 507 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*368&lt;/span&gt; (1978). Of course, even the specter of liability can entail substantial social costs, such as inhibiting public officials in the discharge of their duties. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Harlow&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fitzgerald, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 814. We may not ignore the central command of the Fourth Amendment, however, to avoid these costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The record in this case makes it abundantly clear that Ms. Atwater's arrest was constitutionally unreasonable. Atwater readily admits&#151;as she did when Officer Turek pulled her over&#151;that she violated Texas' seatbelt law. Brief for Petitioners 2-3; Record 381, 384. While Turek was justified in stopping Atwater, see &lt;i&gt;Whren&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S., at 819, neither law nor reason supports his decision to arrest her instead of simply giving her a citation. The officer's actions cannot sensibly be viewed as a permissible means of balancing Atwater's Fourth Amendment interests with the State's own legitimate interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no question that Officer Turek's actions severely infringed Atwater's liberty and privacy. Turek was loud and accusatory from the moment he approached Atwater's car. Atwater's young children were terrified and hysterical. Yet when Atwater asked Turek to lower his voice because he was scaring the children, he responded by jabbing his finger in Atwater's face and saying, "You're going to jail." Record 382, 384. Having made the decision to arrest, Turek did not inform Atwater of her right to remain silent. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 390, 704. He instead asked for her license and insurance information. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 382. But cf. &lt;i&gt;Miranda&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arizona,&lt;/i&gt; 384 U. S. 436 (1966).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atwater asked if she could at least take her children to a friend's house down the street before going to the police station. Record 384. But Turek&#151;who had just castigated Atwater for not caring for her children&#151;refused and said he would take the children into custody as well. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 384, 427, 704-705. Only the intervention of neighborhood &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*369&lt;/span&gt; children who had witnessed the scene and summoned one of Atwater's friends saved the children from being hauled to jail with their mother. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 382, 385-386.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the children gone, Officer Turek handcuffed Ms. Atwater with her hands behind her back, placed her in the police car, and drove her to the police station. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 386-387. Ironically, Turek did not secure Atwater in a seatbelt for the drive. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 386. At the station, Atwater was forced to remove her shoes, relinquish her possessions, and wait in a holding cell for about an hour. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 387, 706. A judge finally informed Atwater of her rights and the charges against her, and released her when she posted bond. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 387-388, 706. Atwater returned to the scene of the arrest, only to find that her car had been towed. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 389.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Atwater ultimately pleaded no contest to violating the seatbelt law and was fined $50. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 403. Even though that fine was the maximum penalty for her crime, Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &#167; 545.413(d) (1999), and even though Officer Turek has never articulated any justification for his actions, the city contends that arresting Atwater was constitutionally reasonable because it advanced two legitimate interests: "the enforcement of child safety laws and encouraging [Atwater] to appear for trial." Brief for Respondents 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to see how arresting Atwater served either of these goals any more effectively than the issuance of a citation. With respect to the goal of law enforcement generally, Atwater did not pose a great danger to the community. She had been driving very slowly&#151;approximately 15 miles per hour&#151;in broad daylight on a residential street that had no other traffic. Record 380. Nor was she a repeat offender; until that day, she had received one traffic citation in her life&#151;a ticket, more than 10 years earlier, for failure to signal a lane change. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 378. Although Officer Turek had stopped Atwater approximately three months earlier because he thought that Atwater's son was not wearing a seatbelt, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 420, Turek had been mistaken, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 379, 703. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*370&lt;/span&gt; Moreover, Atwater immediately accepted responsibility and apologized for her conduct. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 381, 384, 420. Thus, there was every indication that Atwater would have buckled herself and her children in had she been cited and allowed to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to the related goal of child welfare, the decision to arrest Atwater was nothing short of counterproductive. Atwater's children witnessed Officer Turek yell at their mother and threaten to take them all into custody. Ultimately, they were forced to leave her behind with Turek, knowing that she was being taken to jail. Understandably, the 3-year-old boy was "very, very, very traumatized." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 393. After the incident, he had to see a child psychologist regularly, who reported that the boy "felt very guilty that he couldn't stop this horrible thing . . . he was powerless to help his mother or sister." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 396. Both of Atwater's children are now terrified at the sight of any police car. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 393, 395. According to Atwater, the arrest "just never leaves us. It's a conversation we have every other day, once a week, and it's&#151;it raises its head constantly in our lives." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 395.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing Atwater surely would have served the children's interests well. It would have taught Atwater to ensure that her children were buckled up in the future. It also would have taught the children an important lesson in accepting responsibility and obeying the law. Arresting Atwater, though, taught the children an entirely different lesson: that "the bad person could just as easily be the policeman as it could be the most horrible person they could imagine." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondents also contend that the arrest was necessary to ensure Atwater's appearance in court. Atwater, however, was far from a flight risk. A 16-year resident of Lago Vista, population 2,486, Atwater was not likely to abscond. See Record 376; Texas State Data Center, 1997 Total Population Estimates for Texas Places 15 (Sept. 1998). Although she &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*371&lt;/span&gt; was unable to produce her driver's license because it had been stolen, she gave Officer Turek her license number and address. Record 386. In addition, Officer Turek knew from their previous encounter that Atwater was a local resident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city's justifications fall far short of rationalizing the extraordinary intrusion on Gail Atwater and her children. Measuring "the degree to which [Atwater's custodial arrest was] needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests," against "the degree to which it intrud[ed] upon [her] privacy," &lt;i&gt;Wyoming&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Houghton,&lt;/i&gt; 526 U. S., at 300, it can hardly be doubted that Turek's actions were disproportionate to Atwater's crime. The majority's assessment that "Atwater's claim to live free of pointless indignity and confinement clearly outweighs anything the City can raise against it specific to her case," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 347, is quite correct. In my view, the Fourth Amendment inquiry ends there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court's error, however, does not merely affect the disposition of this case. The &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; rule that the Court creates has potentially serious consequences for the everyday lives of Americans. A broad range of conduct falls into the category of fine-only misdemeanors. In Texas alone, for example, disobeying any sort of traffic warning sign is a misdemeanor punishable only by fine, see Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &#167; 472.022 (1999 and Supp. 2000-2001), as is failing to pay a highway toll, see &#167; 284.070, and driving with expired license plates, see &#167; 502.407. Nor are fine-only crimes limited to the traffic context. In several States, for example, littering is a criminal offense punishable only by fine. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Cal. Penal Code Ann. &#167; 374.7 (West 1999); Ga. Code Ann. &#167; 16&#151; 7-43 (1996); Iowa Code &#167;&#167; 321.369, 805.8(2)(af) (Supp. 2001).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, such laws are valid and wise exercises of the States' power to protect the public health and welfare. My concern lies not with the decision to enact or enforce these &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*372&lt;/span&gt; laws, but rather with the manner in which they may be enforced. Under today's holding, when a police officer has probable cause to believe that a fine-only misdemeanor offense has occurred, that officer may stop the suspect, issue a citation, and let the person continue on her way. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Whren&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S., at 806. Or, if a traffic violation, the officer may stop the car, arrest the driver, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 354, search the driver, see &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Robinson,&lt;/i&gt; 414 U. S., at 235, search the entire passenger compartment of the car including any purse or package inside, see &lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Belton,&lt;/i&gt; 453 U. S., at 460, and impound the car and inventory all of its contents, see &lt;i&gt;Colorado&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bertine,&lt;/i&gt; 479 U. S. 367, 374 (1987); &lt;i&gt;Florida&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wells,&lt;/i&gt; 495 U. S. 1, 4-5 (1990). Although the Fourth Amendment expressly requires that the latter course be a reasonable and proportional response to the circumstances of the offense, the majority gives officers unfettered discretion to choose that course without articulating a single reason why such action is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such unbounded discretion carries with it grave potential for abuse. The majority takes comfort in the lack of evidence of "an epidemic of unnecessary minor-offense arrests." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 353, and n. 25. But the relatively small number of published cases dealing with such arrests proves little and should provide little solace. Indeed, as the recent debate over racial profiling demonstrates all too clearly, a relatively minor traffic infraction may often serve as an excuse for stopping and harassing an individual. After today, the arsenal available to any officer extends to a full arrest and the searches permissible concomitant to that arrest. An officer's subjective motivations for making a traffic stop are not relevant considerations in determining the reasonableness of the stop. See &lt;i&gt;Whren&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 813. But it is precisely because these motivations are beyond our purview that we must vigilantly ensure that officers' poststop actions&#151;which are properly within our reach&#151;comport with the Fourth Amendment's guarantee of reasonableness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*373&lt;/span&gt; * * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court neglects the Fourth Amendment's express command in the name of administrative ease. In so doing, it cloaks the pointless indignity that Gail Atwater suffered with the mantle of reasonableness. I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1]  Turek had previously stopped Atwater for what he had thought was a seatbelt violation, but had realized that Atwater's son, although seated on the vehicle's armrest, was in fact belted in.Atwater acknowledged that her son's seating position was unsafe, and Turek issued a verbal warning. See Record 379.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The term apparently meant very different things in different commonlaw contexts. For instance, under a statute enacted during the reign of Charles II forbidding service of any warrant or other court process on Sunday "except in cases of treason, felony or breach of the peace," 29 Car. II, ch. 7, &#167; 6, 8 Statutes at Large 414 (1676), "it was held that every indictable offense was constructively a breach of the peace," Wilgus, Arrest Without a Warrant, 22 Mich. L. Rev. 541, 574 (1924); see also &lt;i&gt;Ex parte Whitchurch,&lt;/i&gt; 1 Atk. 56, 58, 26 Eng. Rep. 37, 39 (Ch. 1749). The term carried a similarly broad meaning when employed to define the jurisdiction of justices of the peace, see 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, ch. 8, &#167; 38, p. 60 (6th ed. 1787) (hereinafter Hawkins), or to delimit the scope of parliamentary privilege, see &lt;i&gt;Williamson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 207 U. S. 425, 435-446 (1908) (discussing common-law origins of Arrest Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, &#167; 6, cl. 1).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when used to describe common-law arrest authority, the term's precise import is not altogether clear. See J. Turner, Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law &#167; 695, p. 537 (17th ed. 1958) ("Strangely enough what constitutes a `breach of the peace' has not been authoritatively laid down"); G. Williams, Arrest for Breach of the Peace, 1954 Crim. L. Rev. 578, 578-579 ("The expression `breach of the peace' seems clearer than it is and there is a surprising lack of authoritative definition of what one would suppose to be a fundamental concept in criminal law"); Wilgus, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 573 ("What constitutes a &lt;i&gt;breach of peace&lt;/i&gt; is not entirely certain"). More often than not, when used in reference to common-law arrest power, the term seemed to connote an element of violence. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; M. Dalton, Country Justice, ch. 3, p. 9 (1727) ("The Breach of th[e] Peace seemeth to be any injurious Force or Violence moved against the Person of another, his Goods, Lands, or other Possessions, whether by threatening words, or by furious Gesture, or Force of the Body, or any other Force used &lt;i&gt;in terrorem&lt;/i&gt; "). On occasion, however, common-law commentators included in their descriptions of breaches of the peace offenses that do not necessarily involve violence or a threat thereof. See M. Hale, A Methodical Summary of the Principal Matters Relating to the Pleas of the Crown *134 (7th ed. 1773) ("Barretries"); 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 149 (1769) (hereinafter Blackstone) ("[s]preading false news"). For purposes of this case, it is unnecessary to reach a definitive resolution of the uncertainty. As stated in the text, we will assume that as used in the context of common-law arrest, the phrase "breach of the peace" was understood narrowly, as entailing at least a threat of violence.&lt;/p&gt;

Trotter, Seventeenth Century Life in the Country Parish: With Special Reference to Local Government 88 (1919)(describing broad authority of local constables and concluding that, "[i]n short, the constable must apprehend, take charge of and present for trial all persons who broke the laws, written or unwritten, against the King's peace or against the statutes of the realm . . .").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  See 2 Hawkins, ch. 13, &#167; 1, at 129 ("[W]herever any [warrantless] arrest may be justified by a private person, in every such case &lt;i&gt;&#224; fortiori&lt;/i&gt; it may be justified by any [peace] officer").&lt;/p&gt;

Rep., at 1088 ("The common law, in many cases, gives authority to arrest without a warrant; more especially, where taken in the very act . . .").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  7 &amp;amp; 8 Geo. IV, ch. 27, 67 Statutes at Large 153.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  Atwater seeks to distinguish the nightwalker statutes by arguing that they "just reflected the reasonable notion that, in an age before lighting, finding a person walking about in the dead of night equaled probable suspicion that the person was a felon." Reply Brief for Petitioners 7, n. 6. Hale indicates, however, that nightwalkers and felons were not considered to be one and the same. 2 Hale, Pleas of the Crown, at 97 ("And such a watchman may apprehend night-walkers and commit them to custody till the morning, and also felons and persons suspected of felony").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9]  Given these early colonial and state laws, the fact that a number of States that ratified the Fourth Amendment generally incorporated common-law principles into their own constitutions or statutes, see &lt;i&gt;Wilson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arkansas,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S. 927, 934 (1995), cannot aid Atwater here. Founding-era receptions of common law, whether by state constitution or state statute, generally provided that common-law rules were subject to statutory alteration. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Del. Const., Art. 25 (1776), 2 W. Swindler, Sources and Documents of United States Constitutions 203 (1973) (hereinafter Swindler) ("The common law of England . . . shall remain in force, unless [it] shall be altered by a future law of the legislature"); N. J. Const., Art. XXII (1776), 6 Swindler 452 ("[T]he common law of England . . . shall still remain in force, until [it] shall be altered by a future law of the Legislature"); N. Y. Const., Art. XXXV (1777), 7 Swindler 177-178 ("[S]uch parts of the common law of England, and of the statute law of England and Great Britain . . . as together did form the law of [New York on April 19, 1775,] shall be and continue the law of this State, subject to such alterations and provisions as the legislature of this State shall, from time to time, make concerning the same"); N. C. Laws 1778, ch. V, in 1 First Laws of the State of North Carolina 353 (J. Cushing ed. 1984) ("[A]ll such . . . Parts of the Common Law, as were heretofore in Force and Use within this Territory . . . which have not been . . . abrogated [or] repealed . . . are hereby declared to be in full Force within this State"); Ordinances of May 1776, ch. 5, &#167; 6, 9 Statutes at Large of Virginia 127 (W. Hening ed. 1821) ("[T]he common law of England . . . shall be the rule of decision, and shall be considered in full force, until the same shall be altered by the legislative power of this colony").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[10]  Courts and commentators alike have read the 1792 Act as conferring broad warrantless arrest authority on federal officers, and, indeed, the Act's passage "so soon after the adoption of the Fourth Amendment itself underscores the probability that the constitutional provision was intended to restrict entirely different practices." &lt;i&gt;Watson,&lt;/i&gt; 423 U. S., at 429 (Powell, J., concurring); see also Amar, Fourth Amendment First Principles, 107 Harv. L. Rev., at 764, and n. 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[11]  We need not, and thus do not, speculate whether the Fourth Amendment entails an "in the presence" requirement for purposes of misdemeanor arrests. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Welsh&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin,&lt;/i&gt; 466 U. S. 740, 756 (1984) (White, J.,dissenting) ("[T]he requirement that a misdemeanor must have occurred in the officer's presence to justify a warrantless arrest is not grounded in the Fourth Amendment").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[12]  See Appendix, &lt;i&gt;infra.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[13]  See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 18 U. S. C. &#167; 3052 (Federal Bureau of Investigation agents authorized to "make arrests without warrant for any offense against the United States committed in their presence"); &#167; 3053 (same, for United States marshals and deputies); &#167; 3056(c)(1)(C) (same, for Secret Service agents); &#167; 3061(a)(2) (same, for postal inspectors); &#167; 3063(a)(3) (same, for Environmental Protection Agency officers); 19 U. S. C. &#167; 1589a(3) (same, for customs officers); 21 U. S. C. &#167; 878(a)(3) (same, for Drug Enforcement Administration agents); 25 U. S. C. &#167; 2803(3)(A) (same, for Bureau of Indian Affairs officers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[14]  And, indeed, the dissent chooses not to deal with history at all. See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 360 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). As is no doubt clear from the text, the historical record is not nearly as murky as the dissent suggests. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 333-335 (parliamentary statutes clearly authorizing warrantless arrests for misdemeanor-level offenses), 337-338 (colonial and founding-era state statutes clearly authorizing same). History, moreover, is not just "one of the tools" relevant to a Fourth Amendment inquiry, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 361. Justice O'Connor herself has observed that courts must be "reluctant . . . to conclude that the Fourth Amendment proscribes a practice that was accepted at the time of adoption of the Bill of Rights and has continued to receive the support of many state legislatures," &lt;i&gt;Tennessee&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Garner,&lt;/i&gt; 471 U. S. 1, 26 (1985) (dissenting opinion), as the practice of making warrantless misdemeanor arrests surely was and has, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt;  at 337-345. Because here the dissent "claim[s] that [a] practic[e] accepted when the Fourth Amendment was adopted [is] now constitutionally impermissible," the dissent bears the "heavy burden" of justifying a departure from the historical understanding. 471 U. S., at 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[15]  Although it is unclear from Atwater's briefs whether the rule she proposes would bar custodial arrests for fine-only offenses even when made pursuant to a warrant, at oral argument Atwater's counsel "concede[d] that if a warrant were obtained, this arrest . . . would . . . be reasonable." Tr. of Oral Arg. 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[16]  &lt;i&gt;Terry&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ohio,&lt;/i&gt; 392 U. S. 1 (1968), upon which the dissent relies, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 366, is not to the contrary. &lt;i&gt;Terry&lt;/i&gt; certainly supports a more finely tuned approach to the Fourth Amendment when police act without the traditional justification that either a warrant (in the case of a search) or probable cause (in the case of arrest) provides; but at least in the absence of "extraordinary" circumstances, &lt;i&gt;Whren&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S. 806, 818 (1996), there is no comparable cause for finicking when police act with such justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[17]  Compare, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Brief for Petitioners 46 ("fine-only") with, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Tr. of Oral Arg. 11 (misdemeanors). Because the difficulties attendant to any major crime-minor crime distinction are largely the same, we treat them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[18]  See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Welsh,&lt;/i&gt; 466 U. S., at 756 (first DUI offense subject to maximum fine of $200; subsequent offense punishable by one year's imprisonment); &lt;i&gt;Carroll&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 267 U. S. 132, 154 (1925) (first offense of smuggling liquor subject to maximum fine of $500; subsequent offense punishable by 90 days' imprisonment); 21 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 844a(a), (c) (first offense for possession of "personal use amount" of controlled substance subject to maximum $10,000 fine; subsequent offense punishable by imprisonment); Tex. Penal Code Ann. &#167;&#167; 42.01, 49.02, 12.23, 12.43 (1994 and Supp. 2001) (first public drunkenness or disorderly conduct offense subject to maximum $500 fine; third offense punishable by 180 days' imprisonment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[19]  See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 21 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 844, 844a (possession of "personal use amount" of a controlled substance subject to maximum $10,000 fine; possession of larger amount punishable by one year's imprisonment); Tex. Health &amp;amp; Safety Code Ann. &#167; 481.121(b) (Supp. 2001) (possession of four ounces or less of marijuana a misdemeanor; possession of more than four ounces a felony). See generally National Survey of State Laws 151-188 (3d R. Leiter ed. 1999) (surveying state laws concerning drug possession).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[20]  For instance, the act of allowing a small child to stand unrestrained in the front seat of a moving vehicle at least arguably constitutes child endangerment, which under Texas law is a state jail felony. Tex. Penal Code Ann. &#167;&#167; 22.041(c), (f) (Supp. 2001). Cf. also 21 Am. Jur. 2d, Criminal Law &#167; 28 (1998) ("[S]ome statutory schemes permit courts in their discretion to term certain offenses as felonies or as misdemeanors").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[21]  See &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v.&lt;i&gt;Watson,&lt;/i&gt; 423 U. S. 411, 423-424 (1976) ("[T]he judgment of the Nation and Congress has . . . long been to authorize warrantless public arrests on probable cause rather than to encumber criminal prosecutions with endless litigation with respect to the existence of exigent circumstances, whether it was practicable to get a warrant, whether the suspect was about to flee, and the like").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[22]  The doctrine of qualified immunity is not the panacea the dissent believes it to be. See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 367-368. As the dissent itself rightly acknowledges, even where personal liability does not ultimately materialize, the mere "specter of liability" may inhibit public officials in the discharge of their duties, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 368, for even those officers with airtight qualified immunity defenses are forced to incur "the expenses of litigation" and to endure the "diversion of [their] official energy from pressing public issues," &lt;i&gt;Harlow&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fitzgerald,&lt;/i&gt; 457 U. S. 800, 814 (1982). Further, and somewhat perversely, the disincentive to arrest produced by Atwater's opaque standard would be most pronounced in the very situations in which police officers can least afford to hesitate: when acting "on the spur (and in the heat) of the moment," &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 347. We could not seriously expect that when events were unfolding fast, an officer would be able to tell with much confidence whether a suspect's conduct qualified, or even "reasonably" qualified, under one of the exceptions to Atwater's general no-arrests rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[23]  He referred to a newspaper account of a girl taken into custody for eating french fries in a Washington, D. C., subway station. Tr. of Oral Arg. 20-21; see also Washington Post, Nov. 16, 2000, p. A1 (describing incident). Not surprisingly, given the practical and political considerations discussed in text, the Washington Metro Transit Police recently revised their "zero-tolerance" policy to provide for citation in lieu of custodial arrest of subway snackers. Washington Post, Feb. 27, 2001, at B1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[24]  One of Atwater's &lt;i&gt;amici&lt;/i&gt; described a handful in its brief. Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as &lt;i&gt;Amici Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 7-8 (reporting arrests for littering, riding a bicycle without a bell or gong, operating a business without a license, and "walking as to create a hazard").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[25]  The dissent insists that a minor traffic infraction "may often serve as an excuse" for harassment, and that fine-only misdemeanor prohibitions "may be enforced" in an arbitrary manner. &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 372. Thus, the dissent warns, the rule that we recognize today "has potentially serious consequences for the everyday lives of Americans" and "carries with it grave potential for abuse." &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 371, 372. But the dissent's own language (&lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; "may," "potentially") betrays the speculative nature of its claims. Noticeably absent from the parade of horribles is any indication that the "potential for abuse" has ever ripened into a reality. In fact, as we have pointed out in text, there simply is no evidence of widespread abuse of minor-offense arrest authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Parts III&#151;B and III&#151;C.&lt;sup&gt;[&#134;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second time this Term, we are faced with the question whether federal postconviction relief is available when a prisoner challenges a current sentence on the ground that it was enhanced based on an allegedly unconstitutional prior conviction for which the petitioner is no longer in custody. In &lt;i&gt;Daniels&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 374, we held that such relief is generally not available to a federal prisoner through a motion to vacate the sentence under 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2255 (1994 ed., Supp. V), but left open the possibility that relief might be appropriate in rare circumstances. We now hold that relief is similarly unavailable to state prisoners through a petition &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*397&lt;/span&gt; for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2254 (1994 ed. and Supp. V).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent Edward R. Coss, Jr., has an extensive criminal record. By the age of 16, he had been adjudged a juvenile delinquent on five separate occasions for offenses including theft, disorderly conduct, assault, and burglary. See Record Doc. No. 101 (Pl. Exh. 5, pp. 4-6). By the time he turned 23, Coss had been convicted in adult court of assault, institutional vandalism, criminal mischief, disorderly conduct, and possession of a controlled substance. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 6-7. His record also reveals arrests for assault, making terroristic threats, delivery of controlled substances, reckless endangerment, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, retail theft, and criminal conspiracy, although each of those charges was later dropped. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; A report generated by the Lackawanna County Adult Probation Office sums up the "one consistent factor in this defendant's life: criminal behavior, much of it being aggressive." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case revolves around two of the many entries on Coss' criminal record. In October 1986, Coss was convicted in Pennsylvania state court of simple assault, institutional vandalism, and criminal mischief. He was then sentenced to two consecutive prison terms of six months to one year. He did not file a direct appeal. See App. 54a; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 1987, Coss filed a petition for relief from the 1986 convictions under the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &#167; 9541 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; (1998), alleging that his trial attorney had been constitutionally ineffective. See App. 50a&#151;53a. The Lackawanna County Court of Common Pleas promptly appointed counsel for Coss, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 57a, and the district attorney filed an answer to the petition, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 59a. The court, however, took no further action on the petition for the remainder of Coss' time in custody. Indeed, it appears that Coss' state postconviction petition has now &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*398&lt;/span&gt; been pending for almost 14 years, and has never been the subject of a judicial ruling. Neither petitioners nor respondent is able to explain this lapse. Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, 29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1990, after he had served the full sentences for his 1986 convictions, Coss was again convicted in Pennsylvania state court, this time of aggravated assault. He was sentenced to 6 to 12 years in prison, but successfully challenged this sentence on direct appeal because of a possible inaccuracy in the presentence report. App. 62a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On remand, the court's first task was to determine the range of sentences for which Coss was eligible. In calculating Coss' "prior record score"&#151;one of two determinants of the applicable sentencing range, see 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &#167; 9721 (1998) (reproducing 204 Pa. Code &#167; 303.9(a) (1998))&#151;the new presentence report took account of Coss' most serious juvenile adjudication and Coss' 1986 misdemeanor convictions, counting the latter as separate offenses. See Record Doc. No. 101 (Pl. Exh. 3, at 10). Coss objected, claiming that his 1986 convictions should be counted as one misdemeanor offense because they arose from the same transaction. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; (Pl. Exh. 5, at 3-4). The trial court sustained Coss' objection, finding that the convictions should be "view[ed] . . . as being one transaction, one incident, one conviction." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 5. Under the Pennsylvania Sentencing Guidelines, one prior misdemeanor does not affect the prior record score. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 10 (displaying grid for calculating prior record score). Thus, the practical effect of the court's decision was to eliminate the 1986 convictions from Coss' prior record score entirely. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.;&lt;/i&gt; see also 204 F. 3d 453, 467-468 (CA3 2000) (en banc) (Nygaard, J., dissenting). Consequently, Coss' 1986 convictions played no part in determining the range of sentences to which Coss was exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court's next task was to choose a sentence within that range. In doing so, the trial court considered a number of factors, including "the seriousness and nature of the crime involved here, the well being and protection of the people &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*399&lt;/span&gt; who live in our community, your criminal disposition, your prior criminal record, the possibility of your rehabilitation, and the testimony that I've heard." Record Doc. No. 101 (Pl. Exh. 3, at 26). The court concluded that "it's indicative that from your actions that you will continue to break the law unless given a period of incarceration." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; The court then reimposed a 6 to 12 year sentence. Because Coss' 1986 convictions are a part of his prior criminal record, the Court of Appeals concluded that the state court took those convictions "into consideration" in sentencing Coss. See 204 F. 3d, at 459.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 1994, Coss filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2254 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. That provision, a postconviction remedy in federal court for state prisoners, provides that a writ of habeas corpus is available to "a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court" if that person "is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States." &#167; 2254(a). In his petition, Coss contended that his 1986 assault conviction was the product of ineffective assistance of counsel. App. 73a&#151;74a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In answer to Coss' &#167; 2254 petition, the Lackawanna County District Attorney argued that the District Court could not review the constitutionality of Coss' 1986 convictions because Coss was no longer in custody on those convictions. Record Doc. No. 55, p. 2. The district attorney, however, indicated his understanding that the crux of Coss' claim was that his 1986 convictions "may have impact &lt;i&gt;[sic]&lt;/i&gt; upon the sentences which have been imposed . . . upon [Coss] for criminal convictions rendered against him" for his 1990 convictions. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; See also Brief for Petitioners 4 ("[R]espondent argues that the sentence for his 1990 conviction was adversely and unconstitutionally affected by the 1986 simple assault conviction").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*400&lt;/span&gt; The District Court stated that Coss was arguing "that his current sentence [for the 1990 conviction] was adversely affected by the 1986 convictions because the sentencing judge considered these allegedly unconstitutional convictions in computing Coss's present sentence." App. to Pet. for Cert. 105a&#151;106a. Finding that "the sentencing judge . . . did make reference to the 1986 convictions in sentencing Coss," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 107a, the court held that it could properly exercise jurisdiction under &#167; 2254, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 108a; see also Record Doc. No. 87, p. 3, n. 2. After an evidentiary hearing, the court denied the petition, holding that Coss' 1986 trial counsel had been ineffective, but that Coss had not been prejudiced by the ineffectiveness. App. to Pet. for Cert. 113a, 116a, 120a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, sitting en banc, agreed that "the sentencing court for the 1990 conviction took into consideration [Coss' 1986] conviction[s]," and therefore that the District Court had jurisdiction over Coss' &#167; 2254 petition. 204 F. 3d, at 459. Citing Circuit precedent and our decisions in &lt;i&gt;Maleng&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cook,&lt;/i&gt; 490 U. S. 488 (1989) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tucker,&lt;/i&gt; 404 U. S. 443 (1972), the court concluded that &#167; 2254 provided a remedy for "an allegedly unconstitutional conviction, even if [the &#167; 2254 petitioner] has served in entirety the sentence resulting from the conviction, if that conviction had an effect on a present sentence." 204 F. 3d, at 459-460.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court then found that Coss had received ineffective assistance during his 1986 trial, and that there was "a reasonable probability" that but for the ineffective assistance, Coss "would not have been found guilty of assau[lt]." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 462. The court remanded the case to the District Court, ordering that the Commonwealth be allowed either to retry Coss for the 1986 assault or to resentence him for the 1990 assault without consideration of the 1986 conviction. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 467.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We granted certiorari to consider the threshold question that the District Court and Court of Appeals both resolved &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*401&lt;/span&gt; in Coss' favor: whether &#167; 2254 provides a remedy where a current sentence was enhanced on the basis of an allegedly unconstitutional prior conviction for which the sentence has fully expired. 531 U. S. 923 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first showing a &#167; 2254 petitioner must make is that he is "in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court." 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2254(a). In &lt;i&gt;Maleng&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cook, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; we considered a situation quite similar to the one presented here. In that case, the respondent had filed a &#167; 2254 petition listing as the "`conviction under attack' " a 1958 state conviction for which he had already served the entirety of his sentence. 490 U. S.&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; at 489-490. He also alleged that the 1958 conviction had been "used illegally to enhance his 1978 state sentences" which he had not yet begun to serve because he was at that time in federal custody on an unrelated matter. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt;  We determined that the respondent was "in custody" on his 1978 sentences because the State had lodged a detainer against him with the federal authorities. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 493.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We held that the respondent was not "in custody" on his 1958 conviction merely because that conviction had been used to enhance a subsequent sentence. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 492. We acknowledged, however, that because his &#167; 2254 petition "[could] be read as asserting a challenge to the 1978 sentences, as enhanced by the allegedly invalid prior conviction,. . . respondent . . . satisfied the `in custody' requirement for federal habeas jurisdiction." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 493-494.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Coss is no longer serving the sentences imposed pursuant to his 1986 convictions, and therefore cannot bring a federal habeas petition directed solely at those convictions. Coss is, however, currently serving the sentence for his 1990 conviction. Like the respondent in &lt;i&gt;Maleng,&lt;/i&gt; Coss' &#167; 2254 petition can be (and has been) construed as "asserting a challenge to the [1990] senten[ce], as enhanced by the allegedly &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*402&lt;/span&gt; invalid prior [1986] conviction." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 493. See also &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 399-400. Accordingly, Coss satisfies &#167; 2254's "in custody" requirement. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Daniels, ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 383, 384, n. 2 (stating that the text of &#167; 2255, which also contains an "in custody" requirement, is broad enough to cover a claim that a current sentence enhanced by an allegedly unconstitutional prior conviction violates due process).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More important for our purposes here is the question we explicitly left unanswered in &lt;i&gt;Maleng:&lt;/i&gt; "the extent to which the [prior expired] conviction itself may be subject to challenge in the attack upon the [current] senten[ce] which it was used to enhance." 490 U. S., at 494. We encountered this same question in the &#167; 2255 context in &lt;i&gt;Daniels&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 374. We held there that "[i]f .. . a prior conviction used to enhance a federal sentence is no longer open to direct or collateral attack in its own right because the defendant failed to pursue those remedies while they were available (or because the defendant did so unsuccessfully), then that defendant . . . may not collaterally attack his prior conviction through a motion under &#167; 2255." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 382. We now extend this holding to cover &#167; 2254 petitions directed at enhanced state sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We grounded our holding in &lt;i&gt;Daniels&lt;/i&gt; on considerations relating to the need for finality of convictions and ease of administration. Those concerns are equally present in the &#167; 2254 context. The first and most compelling interest is in the finality of convictions. Once a judgment of conviction is entered in state court, it is subject to review in multiple forums. Specifically, each State has created mechanisms for both direct appeal and state postconviction review, see L. Yackle, Postconviction Remedies &#167;&#167; 1, 13 (1981 and Supp. 2000), even though there is no constitutional mandate that they do so, see &lt;i&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Finley,&lt;/i&gt; 481 U. S. 551, 557 (1987) (no constitutional right to state postconviction &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*403&lt;/span&gt; review); &lt;i&gt;Abney&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 431 U. S. 651, 656 (1977) (no constitutional right to direct appeal). Moreover, &#167; 2254 makes federal courts available to review state criminal proceedings for compliance with federal constitutional mandates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we said in &lt;i&gt;Daniels,&lt;/i&gt; "[t]hese vehicles for review . . . are not available indefinitely and without limitation." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 381. A defendant may choose not to seek review of his conviction within the prescribed time. Or he may seek review and not prevail, either because he did not comply with procedural rules or because he failed to prove a constitutional violation. In each of these situations, the defendant's conviction becomes final and the State that secured the conviction obtains a strong interest in preserving the integrity of the judgment. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 379-380. Other jurisdictions acquire an interest as well, as they may then use that conviction for their own recidivist sentencing purposes, relying on "the `presumption of regularity' that attaches to final judgments." &lt;i&gt;Parke&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Raley,&lt;/i&gt; 506 U. S. 20, 29 (1992); see also &lt;i&gt;Daniels, ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 380.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional concern is ease of administration of challenges to expired state convictions. Federal courts sitting in habeas jurisdiction must consult state court records and transcripts to ensure that challenged convictions were obtained in a manner consistent with constitutional demands. As time passes, and certainly once a state sentence has been served to completion, the likelihood that trial records will be retained by the local courts and will be accessible for review diminishes substantially. See &lt;i&gt;Daniels, ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 379.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, as in &lt;i&gt;Daniels,&lt;/i&gt; we hold that once a state conviction is no longer open to direct or collateral attack in its own right because the defendant failed to pursue those remedies while they were available (or because the defendant did so unsuccessfully), the conviction may be regarded as conclusively valid. See &lt;i&gt;Daniels, ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 382. If that conviction is later used to enhance a criminal sentence, the defendant &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*404&lt;/span&gt; generally may not challenge the enhanced sentence through a petition under &#167; 2254 on the ground that the prior conviction was unconstitutionally obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in &lt;i&gt;Daniels,&lt;/i&gt; we recognize an exception to the general rule for &#167; 2254 petitions that challenge an enhanced sentence on the basis that the prior conviction used to enhance the sentence was obtained where there was a failure to appoint counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment, as set forth in &lt;i&gt;Gideon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wainwright,&lt;/i&gt; 372 U. S. 335 (1963). The special status of &lt;i&gt;Gideon&lt;/i&gt; claims in this context is well established in our case law. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S. 485, 496-497 (1994); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tucker,&lt;/i&gt; 404 U. S., at 449; &lt;i&gt;Burgett&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Texas,&lt;/i&gt; 389 U. S. 109, 115 (1967). Cf. &lt;i&gt;Daniels, ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 382.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we recognized in &lt;i&gt;Custis,&lt;/i&gt; the "failure to appoint counsel for an indigent [is] a unique constitutional defect . . . ris[ing] to the level of a jurisdictional defect," which therefore warrants special treatment among alleged constitutional violations. See 511 U. S., at 496. Moreover, allowing an exception for &lt;i&gt;Gideon&lt;/i&gt; challenges does not implicate our concern about administrative ease, as the "failure to appoint counsel . . . will generally appear from the judgment roll itself, or from an accompanying minute order." 511 U. S., at 496.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any &#167; 2254 petition, the petitioner must satisfy the procedural prerequisites for relief including, for example, exhaustion of remedies. See 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2254(b) (1994 ed., Supp. V). When an otherwise qualified &#167; 2254 petitioner can demonstrate that his current sentence was enhanced on the basis of a prior conviction that was obtained where there was a failure to appoint counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment, the current sentence cannot stand and habeas relief is appropriate. Cf. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tucker, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*405&lt;/span&gt; 449 (affirming vacatur of sentence that was based in part on prior uncounseled state convictions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stated in &lt;i&gt;Daniels&lt;/i&gt; that another exception to the general rule precluding habeas relief might be available, although the circumstances of that case did not require us to resolve the issue. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 383-384. We note a similar situation here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general rule we have adopted here and in &lt;i&gt;Daniels&lt;/i&gt;  reflects the notion that a defendant properly bears the consequences of either forgoing otherwise available review of a conviction or failing to successfully demonstrate constitutional error. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 403-404; &lt;i&gt;Daniels, ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 381&#151; 383. It is not always the case, however, that a defendant can be faulted for failing to obtain timely review of a constitutional claim. For example, a state court may, without justification, refuse to rule on a constitutional claim that has been properly presented to it. Cf. 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2244(d)(1)(B) (1994 ed., Supp. V) (tolling 1-year limitations period while petitioner is prevented from filing application by an "impediment . . . created by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States"). Alternatively, after the time for direct or collateral review has expired, a defendant may obtain compelling evidence that he is actually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted, and which he could not have uncovered in a timely manner. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Brady&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maryland,&lt;/i&gt; 373 U. S. 83 (1963); 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2244(b)(2)(B) (1994 ed., Supp. V) (allowing a second or successive habeas corpus application if "the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence; and . . . the facts underlying the claim, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable fact finder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*406&lt;/span&gt; In such situations, a habeas petition directed at the enhanced sentence may effectively be the first and only forum available for review of the prior conviction. As in &lt;i&gt;Daniels,&lt;/i&gt;  this case does not require us to determine whether, or under what precise circumstances, a petitioner might be able to use a &#167; 2254 petition in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever such a petitioner must show to be eligible for review, the challenged prior conviction must have adversely affected the sentence that is the subject of the habeas petition. This question was adequately raised and considered below. As the District Court stated, Coss contended "that his current sentence [for the 1990 conviction] was &lt;i&gt;adversely affected&lt;/i&gt; by the 1986 convictions because the sentencing judge considered these allegedly unconstitutional convictions in computing Coss's present sentence." App. to Pet. for Cert. 105a&#151;106a (emphasis added). The District Court and majority of the Court of Appeals agreed with Coss on this point. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 107a; 204 F. 3d, at 459. Judge Nygaard, joined by Judge Roth, dissented to dispute the conclusion that the 1986 convictions had any effect whatsoever on Coss' sentence for the 1990 conviction. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 467-469.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;C&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a careful examination of the record here, we are satisfied that the findings of the lower courts on this threshold factual point are clearly erroneous. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Neil&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Biggers,&lt;/i&gt; 409 U. S. 188, 193, n.3 (1972). We therefore conclude that respondent Coss does not qualify to have his &#167; 2254 petition reviewed, even assuming the existence of a limited exception to the general rule barring review of an expired prior conviction. Specifically, it is clear that any "consideration" the trial court may have given to Coss' 1986 convictions in reimposing sentence for his 1990 conviction did not actually affect that sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we explain above, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 398-399, when Coss was resentenced on his 1990 conviction, he objected to the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*407&lt;/span&gt; presentence report's calculation of his prior record score. The court sustained that objection and, in effect, eliminated Coss' 1986 convictions from the prior record score entirely. Because the prior record score is one of two determinants of the applicable sentencing range, see 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &#167; 9721 (1998) (reproducing 204 Pa. Code &#167; 303.9(a) (1998)), it is clear that Coss' 1986 convictions had no role in determining the range of sentences to which Coss was exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In choosing a sentence for Coss within that range, the trial court considered several factors, including "the seriousness and nature of the crime involved here, the well being and protection of the people who live in our community, your criminal disposition, your prior criminal record, the possibility of your rehabilitation, and the testimony that I've heard." Record Doc. No. 101 (Pl. Exh. 3, at 26). Coss' 1986 convictions are, of course, a portion of his criminal record. Thus, it is technically correct to say that the court "considered" those convictions before sentencing Coss. Cf. 204 F. 3d, at 459.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is a different thing entirely to say that the 1986 convictions actually increased the length of the sentence the court ultimately imposed. As the sentencing court told Coss, "I think that it's indicative that from your actions that you will continue to break the law unless given a period of incarceration." Record Doc. No. 101 (Pl. Exh. 3, at 26). The "actions" to which the judge referred were obviously not limited to Coss' criminal conduct in 1986, but Coss' extensive and violent criminal record as a whole. We conclude, as Judge Nygaard did below, that the 1986 convictions are "such a minor component of [Coss'] record that there is no question that the sentencing court, given its concerns, would have imposed exactly the same sentence" had those convictions been omitted from Coss' record. 204 F. 3d, at 468 (dissenting opinion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We note that the record does not explain why Coss' ineffective assistance claim did not receive a timely adjudication &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*408&lt;/span&gt; in the Pennsylvania courts. While the reason might have been that Coss' petition "slipped through the cracks," due to no fault of his own, Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, it might also have been that Coss was responsible for "request[ing] that the matter be brought up for a hearing," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 5. But even if Coss cannot be faulted for that lapse, he would not qualify to have his current &#167; 2254 petition reviewed because the 1990 sentence he is challenging was not actually affected by the 1986 convictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error of&lt;i&gt;Daniels&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 374, is repeated once more, and I respectfully dissent for reasons set out in my dissenting opinion in that case. There is a further reason to disagree with the majority here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although state law theoretically provided a procedure for respondent Coss to challenge his 1986 convictions, the provision has proven to be a mirage; Coss's challenge was filed and answered by the district attorney, only to disappear in the state-court system for almost 14 years, so far. This failure of state process leads the plurality to qualify its general rule against attacking predicates to enhanced sentences, by raising the possibility of such a challenge when the opportunity for attack under provisions of state law, timely invoked, has proven to be imaginary. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 405. The plurality then goes on to deny Coss the benefit of this exception on the ground that he cannot demonstrate that "the challenged prior conviction . . . adversely affected the sentence that is &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*409&lt;/span&gt; the subject of the habeas petition." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 406. This conclusion is premature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of adverse effect was by no means adequately raised and considered by the Court of Appeals. The earlier convictions could have affected the later sentence in either of two ways: by subjecting Coss to a higher sentencing range or by being considered as a reason to give him a higher sentence than he would otherwise have received within a given range. It appears that the sentencing court did not treat the convictions as subjecting Coss to a higher range of potential sentence, but the District Court expressly found that the sentencing court considered the challenged convictions in sentencing Coss to the maximum sentence within the applicable range. App. to Pet. for Cert. 107a ("The sentencing judge, however, did make reference to the 1986 convictions in sentencing Coss to the top of the standard range for his 1990 aggravated assault conviction"). This finding was never challenged in the Court of Appeals,&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; which appeared to accept the District Court's finding as a matter of course. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 11a ("We are satisfied that the sentencing judge . .. took into consideration [Coss's 1986 conviction]").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In holding the District Court's finding to be clearly erroneous, the majority is thus ruling on a matter in the first instance in derogation of this Court's proper role as a court of review. &lt;i&gt;E. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Glover&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 531 U. S. 198 (2001); &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*410&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;National Collegiate Athletic Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Smith,&lt;/i&gt; 525 U. S. 459 (1999); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bestfoods,&lt;/i&gt; 524 U. S. 51, 72-73 (1998). The only responsible course for the majority would be to remand to the Court of Appeals, which could determine whether the district attorney may challenge the District Court's finding of a causal link between the unconstitutional convictions and the later, maximum sentence, or whether this issue has already been waived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Breyer, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the Commonwealth has failed to argue in this Court that the trial court's consideration of respondent's 1986 convictions was harmless, and consequently, the issue has not been briefed, I would not overturn the Court of Appeals' finding that respondent's sentence was enhanced based on the purportedly defective 1986 convictions. The Court of Appeals, however, operated under the belief that the Constitution generally requires 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2254 (1994 ed., Supp. V) petitioners to be able to attack prior convictions that enhanced their sentences. It did not focus on whether the &#167; 2254 proceeding was "the first and only forum available for review of [respondent's] prior conviction[s]." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 406. Accordingly, I would vacate the decision below and remand for consideration of that issue. As respondent has not yet shown that he was denied a forum in which to raise his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, any discussion of a constitutionally based exception is premature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   &lt;i&gt;Edward M. Chikofsky&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;David M. Porter&lt;/i&gt; filed a brief for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging affirmance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&#134;]   Justice Scalia joins all but Parts III&#151;B and III&#151;C of this opinion. Justice Thomas joins all but Part III&#151;B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   The district attorney made no mention of the causal connection between the 1986 conviction and the 1990 sentence either in his brief before the Third Circuit panel, or in his petition for rehearing. That petition claimed only that the panel had improperly applied the principle of &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tucker,&lt;/i&gt; 404 U. S. 443 (1972), to the facts of this case.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the so-called "Epilogue" included in the district attorney's brief before the en banc Court of Appeals argued only that the 1986 conviction did not subject Coss to a higher sentencing range in 1990. Supplemental Brief [on Rehearing] for Appellee in No. 98-7416 (CA3), pp. 15-18. It did not challenge the District Court's finding that the 1990 sentencing court considered the challenged convictions in sentencing Coss to the maximum sentence within the applicable range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;CLARK COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT&lt;br&gt;
v.&lt;br&gt;
BREEDEN&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;No. 00-866.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;United States Supreme Court.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided April 23, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*270&lt;/span&gt; Per Curiam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 255, as amended, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000e&#151;3(a), it is unlawful "for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees . . . because [the employee] has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by [Title VII], or because [the employee] has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under [Title VII]." In 1997, respondent filed a &#167; 2000e&#151;3(a) retaliation claim against petitioner Clark County School District. The claim as eventually amended alleged that petitioner had taken two separate adverse employment actions against her in response to two different protected activities in which she had engaged. The District Court granted summary judgment to petitioner, No. CV&#151;S-97-365&#151;DWH(RJJ) (D. Nev., Feb. 9, 1999), but a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed over the dissent of Judge Fernandez, No. 99-15522, 2000 WL 991821 (July 19, 2000) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; (unpublished), judgt. order reported at 232 F. 3d 893. We grant the writ of certiorari and reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 21, 1994, respondent's male supervisor met with respondent and another male employee to review the psychological evaluation reports of four job applicants. The report for one of the applicants disclosed that the applicant had once commented to a co-worker, "I hear making love to you is like making love to the Grand Canyon." Brief in Opposition 3. At the meeting respondent's supervisor read the comment aloud, looked at respondent and stated, "I don't know what that means." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; The other employee then said, "Well, I'll tell you later," and both men chuckled. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt;  Respondent later complained about the comment to the offending employee, to Assistant Superintendent George Ann Rice, the employee's supervisor, and to another assistant &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*270&lt;/span&gt; superintendent of petitioner. Her first claim of retaliation asserts that she was punished for these complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has applied &#167; 2000e&#151;3(a) to protect employee "oppos[ition]" not just to practices that are actually "made . . . unlawful" by Title VII, but also to practices that the employee could reasonably believe were unlawful. 2000 WL 991821, at *1 (stating that respondent's opposition was protected "if she had a reasonable, good faith belief that the incident involving the sexually explicit remark constituted unlawful sexual harassment"); &lt;i&gt;Trent&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Valley Electric Assn. Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 41 F. 3d 524, 526 (CA9 1994). We have no occasion to rule on the propriety of this interpretation, because even assuming it is correct, no one could reasonably believe that the incident recounted above violated Title VII.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title VII forbids actions taken on the basis of sex that "discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000e&#151;2(a)(1). Just three Terms ago, we reiterated, what was plain from our previous decisions, that sexual harassment is actionable under Title VII only if it is "so `severe or pervasive' as to `alter the conditions of [the victim's] employment and create an abusive working environment.' " &lt;i&gt;Faragher&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Boca Raton,&lt;/i&gt; 524 U. S. 775, 786 (1998) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Meritor Savings Bank, FSB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Vinson,&lt;/i&gt; 477 U. S. 57, 67 (1986) (some internal quotation marks omitted)). See also &lt;i&gt;Burlington Industries, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ellerth,&lt;/i&gt; 524 U. S. 742, 752 (1998) (Only harassing conduct that is "severe or pervasive" can produce a "constructive alteratio[n] in the terms or conditions of employment"); &lt;i&gt;Oncale&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 523 U. S. 75, 81 (1998) (Title VII "forbids only behavior so objectively offensive as to alter the `conditions' of the victim's employment"). Workplace conduct is not measured in isolation; instead, "whether an environment is sufficiently hostile or abusive" must be judged "by `looking at all the circumstances,' including the `frequency of the discriminatory &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*271&lt;/span&gt; conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.' " &lt;i&gt;Faragher&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Boca Raton, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 787-788 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Harris&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Forklift Systems, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 510 U. S. 17, 23 (1993)). Hence, "[a] recurring point in [our] opinions is that simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the `terms and conditions of employment.' " &lt;i&gt;Faragher&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Boca Raton, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 788 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No reasonable person could have believed that the single incident recounted above violated Title VII's standard. The ordinary terms and conditions of respondent's job required her to review the sexually explicit statement in the course of screening job applicants. Her co-workers who participated in the hiring process were subject to the same requirement, and indeed, in the District Court respondent "conceded that it did not bother or upset her" to read the statement in the file. App. to Pet. for Cert. 15 (District Court opinion). Her supervisor's comment, made at a meeting to review the application, that he did not know what the statement meant; her co-worker's responding comment; and the chuckling of both are at worst an "isolated inciden[t]" that cannot remotely be considered "extremely serious," as our cases require, &lt;i&gt;Faragher&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Boca Raton, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 788. The holding of the Court of Appeals to the contrary must be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides claiming that she was punished for complaining to petitioner's personnel about the alleged sexual harassment, respondent also claimed that she was punished for filing charges against petitioner with the Nevada Equal Rights Commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and for filing the present suit. Respondent filed her lawsuit on April 1, 1997; on April 10, 1997, respondent's supervisor, Assistant Superintendent Rice, "mentioned &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*272&lt;/span&gt; to Allin Chandler, Executive Director of plaintiff's union, that she was contemplating transferring plaintiff to the position of Director of Professional Development Education," App. to Pet. for Cert. 11-12 (District Court opinion); and this transfer was "carried through" in May, Brief in Opposition 8. In order to show, as her defense against summary judgment required, the existence of a causal connection between her protected activities and the transfer, respondent "relie[d] wholly on the temporal proximity of the filing of her complaint on April 1, 1997 and Rice's statement to plaintiff's union representative on April 10, 1997 that she was considering transferring plaintiff to the [new] position." App. to Pet. for Cert. 21-22 (District Court opinion). The District Court, however, found that respondent did not serve petitioner with the summons and complaint until April 11, 1997, one day &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; Rice had made the statement, and Rice filed an affidavit stating that she did not become aware of the lawsuit until after April 11, a claim that respondent did not challenge. Hence, the court concluded, respondent "ha[d] not shown that any causal connection exists between her protected activities and the adverse employment decision." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals reversed, relying on two facts: The EEOC had issued a right-to-sue letter to respondent three months before Rice announced she was contemplating the transfer, and the actual transfer occurred one month after Rice learned of respondent's suit. 2000 WL 991821, at *3. The latter fact is immaterial in light of the fact that petitioner concededly was contemplating the transfer before it learned of the suit. Employers need not suspend previously planned transfers upon discovering that a Title VII suit has been filed, and their proceeding along lines previously contemplated, though not yet definitively determined, is no evidence whatever of causality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the right-to-sue letter: Respondent did not rely on that letter in the District Court and did not mention it in &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*273&lt;/span&gt; her opening brief on appeal. Her demonstration of causality all along had rested upon the connection between the transfer and the filing of her lawsuit&#151;to which connection the letter was irrelevant. When, however, petitioner's answering brief in the Court of Appeals demonstrated conclusively the lack of causation between the filing of respondent's lawsuit and Rice's decision, respondent mentioned the letter for the first time in her reply brief, Reply Brief in No. 99-15522 (CA9) pp. 9-10. The Ninth Circuit's opinion did not adopt respondent's utterly implausible suggestion that the &lt;i&gt;EEOC's&lt;/i&gt;  issuance of a right-to-sue letter&#151;an action in which the employee takes no part&#151;is a protected activity of the employee, see 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000e&#151;3(a). Rather, the opinion suggests that the letter provided petitioner with its first notice of respondent's charge before the EEOC, and hence allowed the inference that the transfer proposal made three months later was petitioner's reaction to the charge. See 2000 WL 991821, at *3. This will not do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there is no indication that Rice even knew about the right-to-sue letter when she proposed transferring respondent. And second, if one presumes she knew about it,one must also presume that she (or her predecessor) knew &lt;i&gt;almost two years earlier&lt;/i&gt; about the protected action (filing of the EEOC complaint) that the letter supposedly disclosed. (The complaint had been filed on August 23, 1995, and both Title VII and its implementing regulations require that an employer be given notice within 10 days of filing, 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 2000e&#151;5(b), (e)(1); 29 CFR &#167; 1601.14 (2000).) The cases that accept mere temporal proximity between an employer's knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima facie case uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be "very close," &lt;i&gt;O'Neal&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ferguson Constr. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 237 F. 3d 1248, 1253 (CA10 2001). See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Richmond&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Oneok, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt;  120 F. 3d 205, 209 (CA10 1997) (3-month period insufficient); &lt;i&gt;Hughes&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Derwinski,&lt;/i&gt; 967 F. 2d 1168, 1174-1175 (CA7 1992) &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*274&lt;/span&gt; (4-month period insufficient). Action taken (as here) 20 months later suggests, by itself, no causality at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, neither the grounds that respondent presented to the District Court, nor the ground she added on appeal, nor even the ground the Court of Appeals developed on its own, sufficed to establish a dispute substantial enough to withstand the motion for summary judgment. The District Court's granting of that motion was correct. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*376&lt;/span&gt; O'Connor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court in part, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., joined, and in which Scalia, J., joined, except for that portion of the opinion recognizing that &#167; 2255 may be available in rare circumstances. Scalia, J., filed an opinion concurring in part, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 385. Souter, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens and Ginsburg, JJ., joined, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 387. Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 392.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;G. Michael Tanaka&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs was &lt;i&gt;Maria E. Stratton.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*376&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Robinson, James A. Feldman,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kathleen A. Felton.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court in part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S. 485 (1994), we addressed whether a defendant sentenced under the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. &#167; 924(e), could collaterally attack the validity of previous state convictions used to enhance his federal sentence. We held that, with the sole exception of convictions obtained in violation of the right to counsel, a defendant has no right to bring such a challenge in his federal sentencing proceeding. 511 U. S., at 487. We now consider whether, after the sentencing proceeding has concluded, the individual who was sentenced may challenge his federal sentence through a motion under 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2255 (1994 ed., Supp. V) on the ground that his prior convictions were unconstitutionally obtained. We hold that, as a general rule, he may not. There may be rare circumstances in which &#167; 2255 would be available, but we need not address the issue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1994, petitioner Earthy D. Daniels, Jr., was tried and convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U. S. C. &#167; 922(g)(1). The Government then sought to enhance his sentence under the ACCA. App. 4-5. The ACCA imposes a mandatory minimum 15-year sentence on anyone who violates &#167; 922(g)(1) and who has three previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense. &#167; 924(e)(1). Petitioner had been convicted in California in 1978 and 1981 for robbery, and in 1977 and 1979 for first degree burglary. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 14. The District Court found petitioner to be an armed career criminal within the meaning of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*377&lt;/span&gt; the ACCA and, after granting a downward departure, the District Court sentenced petitioner to 176 months. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 14, 18. Had petitioner not been adjudged an armed career criminal, he would have received at most a 120-month sentence. 18 U. S. C. &#167; 924(a)(2). On direct appeal, petitioner argued unsuccessfully that his two burglary convictions did not qualify as predicate offenses under the ACCA. See 86 F. 3d 1164 (CA9 1996) (table).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner then filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2255 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Section 2255, a postconviction remedy for federal prisoners, permits "[a] prisoner in custody under sentence of a [federal] court" to "move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence" upon the ground that "the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States." Petitioner asserted that his current federal sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution because it was based in part on his 1978 and 1981 robbery convictions. Those prior convictions, he alleged, were themselves unconstitutional because they both were based on guilty pleas that were not knowing and voluntary, and because the 1981 conviction was also the product of ineffective assistance of counsel. App. 51-52. He did not contend that &#167; 2255 relief was appropriate because his current sentence was imposed in violation of the ACCA. Cf. Brief for Petitioner 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Court denied the &#167; 2255 motion, App. 58-67, and a panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, 195 F. 3d 501 (1999). The court held that our decision in &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; "bar[s] federal habeas review of the validity of a prior conviction used for federal sentencing enhancement unless the petitioner raises a . . . claim [under &lt;i&gt;Gideon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wainwright,&lt;/i&gt; 372 U. S. 335 (1963)]." 195 F. 3d, at 503 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because the Courts of Appeals are divided as to whether &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; bars relief under &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*378&lt;/span&gt; &#167; 2255 as well as in federal sentencing proceedings, we granted certiorari. 530 U. S. 1299 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petitioner in &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; attempted, during his federal sentencing proceeding, to attack prior state convictions used to enhance his sentence under the ACCA. Like petitioner here, Custis challenged his prior convictions as the product of allegedly faulty guilty pleas and ineffective assistance of counsel. 511 U. S., at 488. We held that with the sole exception of convictions obtained in violation of the right to counsel, Custis had no right under the ACCA or the Constitution "to collaterally attack prior convictions" in the course of his federal sentencing proceeding. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 490-497. While the "failure to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant was a unique constitutional defect" that justified the exception for challenges concerning &lt;i&gt;Gideon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wainwright,&lt;/i&gt;  372 U. S. 335 (1963), 511 U. S., at 496, challenges of the type Custis sought to bring did not "ris[e] to the level of a jurisdictional defect," &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two considerations supported our constitutional conclusion in &lt;i&gt;Custis:&lt;/i&gt; ease of administration and the interest in promoting the finality of judgments. With respect to the former, we noted that resolving non-&lt;i&gt;Gideon&lt;/i&gt; -type constitutional attacks on prior convictions "would require sentencing courts to rummage through frequently nonexistent or difficult to obtain state-court transcripts or records." 511 U. S., at 496. With respect to the latter, we observed that allowing collateral attacks would "inevitably delay and impair the orderly administration of justice" and "deprive the statecourt judgment of its normal force and effect." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 497 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner contends that the &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; rule should not extend to &#167; 2255 proceedings because the concerns we articulated &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*379&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; are not present in the &#167; 2255 context. Brief for Petitioner 22-26. We disagree. First, a district court evaluating a &#167; 2255 motion is as unlikely as a district court engaged in sentencing to have the documents necessary to evaluate claims arising from long-past proceedings in a different jurisdiction. While petitioner is quite right that federal district courts are capable of evaluating fact-intensive constitutional claims raised by way of a habeas petition, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 22-23, institutional competence does not make decades-old state court records and transcripts any easier to locate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facts of this case only reinforce our concern. For example, petitioner contends that he entered his 1978 and 1981 guilty pleas without a full understanding of the essential elements of the crimes with which he was charged, and therefore the resulting convictions violated due process. App. 40-42, 50-51. These claims by their nature require close scrutiny of the record below. Yet petitioner has not placed the transcript from either plea colloquy in the record. In fact, he has admitted that the 1978 transcript is missing from the state court file. Cf. &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 38, n. 3. Under these circumstances, it would be an almost futile exercise for a district court to attempt to determine accurately what was communicated to petitioner more than two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to the concern for finality, petitioner argues that because he has served the complete sentences for his 1978 and 1981 convictions, the State would suffer little, if any, prejudice if those convictions were invalidated through a collateral challenge under &#167; 2255. Brief for Petitioner 24&#151; 26. To the contrary, even after a defendant has served the full measure of his sentence, a State retains a strong interest in preserving the convictions it has obtained. States impose a wide range of disabilities on those who have been convicted of crimes, even after their release. For example, in California, where petitioner committed his crimes, persons convicted of a felony may be disqualified from holding public office, subjected to restrictions on professional licensing, and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*380&lt;/span&gt; barred from possessing firearms. See U. S. Dept. of Justice, Office of the Pardon Attorney, Civil Disabilities of Convicted Felons: A State-By-State Survey 29-32 (Oct. 1996). Further, each of the 50 States has a statute authorizing enhanced sentences for recidivist offenders. &lt;i&gt;E. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Cal. Penal Code Ann. &#167; 667 (West 1999). See also &lt;i&gt;Parke&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Raley,&lt;/i&gt; 506 U. S. 20, 26-27 (1992).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At oral argument, petitioner suggested that invalidating a prior conviction on constitutional grounds for purposes of its use under the ACCA would have no effect beyond the federal proceeding. Tr. of Oral Arg. 8-10. Although that question is not squarely presented here, if a state conviction were determined to be sufficiently unreliable that it could not be used to enhance a federal sentence, the State's ability to use that judgment subsequently for its own purposes would be, at the very least, greatly undermined. Thus, the State does have a real and continuing interest in the integrity of its judgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the most fundamental level, petitioner attempts to distinguish &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; as a decision only about the appropriate forum in which a defendant may challenge prior convictions used to enhance a federal sentence. The issue in &lt;i&gt;Custis,&lt;/i&gt; according to petitioner, was "`where, not whether, the defendant could attack a prior conviction for constitutional infirmity.' " Brief for Petitioner 14 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Nichols&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S. 738, 765 (1994) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (original emphasis deleted)). The appropriate forum for such a challenge, petitioner argues, at least where no other forum is available, is a federal proceeding under &#167; 2255. Brief for Petitioner 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise underlying petitioner's argument&#151;that defendants may challenge their convictions for constitutional infirmity&#151;is quite correct. It is beyond dispute that convictions must be obtained in a manner that comports with the Federal Constitution. But it does not necessarily follow &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*381&lt;/span&gt; that a &#167; 2255 motion is an appropriate vehicle for determining whether a conviction later used to enhance a federal sentence was unconstitutionally obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our system affords a defendant convicted in state court numerous opportunities to challenge the constitutionality of his conviction. He may raise constitutional claims on direct appeal, in postconviction proceedings available under state law, and in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus brought pursuant to 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2254 (1994 ed. and Supp. V). See generally 1 J. Liebman &amp;amp; R. Hertz, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure &#167; 5.1.a (3d ed. 1998).&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; These vehicles for review, however, are not available indefinitely and without limitation. Procedural barriers, such as statutes of limitations and rules concerning procedural default and exhaustion of remedies, operate to limit access to review on the merits of a constitutional claim. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Olano,&lt;/i&gt; 507 U. S. 725, 731 (1993) ("`No procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right . . . may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it' " (quoting &lt;i&gt;Yakus&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 321 U. S. 414, 444 (1944))). One of the principles vindicated by these limitations is a "presumption deeply rooted in our jurisprudence: the `presumption of regularity' that attaches to final judgments, even when the question is waiver of constitutional rights." &lt;i&gt;Parke, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*382&lt;/span&gt; Thus, we have held that if, by the time of sentencing under the ACCA, a prior conviction has not been set aside on direct or collateral review, that conviction is presumptively valid and may be used to enhance the federal sentence. See &lt;i&gt;Custis,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S., at 497. This rule is subject to only one exception: If an enhanced federal sentence will be based in part on a prior conviction obtained in violation of the right to counsel, the defendant may challenge the validity of his prior conviction during his federal sentencing proceedings. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 496. No other constitutional challenge to a prior conviction may be raised in the sentencing forum. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 497.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an enhanced federal sentence has been imposed pursuant to the ACCA, the person sentenced may pursue any channels of direct or collateral review still available to challenge his prior conviction. In &lt;i&gt;Custis,&lt;/i&gt; we noted the possibility that the petitioner there, who was still in custody on his prior convictions, could "attack his state sentences [in state court] or through federal habeas review." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; If any such challenge to the underlying conviction is successful, the defendant may then apply for reopening of his federal sentence. As in &lt;i&gt;Custis,&lt;/i&gt; we express no opinion on the appropriate disposition of such an application. Cf. &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, however, a prior conviction used to enhance a federal sentence is no longer open to direct or collateral attack in its own right because the defendant failed to pursue those remedies while they were available (or because the defendant did so unsuccessfully), then that defendant is without recourse. The presumption of validity that attached to the prior conviction at the time of sentencing is conclusive, and the defendant may not collaterally attack his prior conviction through a motion under &#167; 2255. A defendant may challenge a prior conviction as the product of a &lt;i&gt;Gideon&lt;/i&gt; violation in a &#167; 2255 motion, but generally only if he raised that claim at his federal sentencing proceeding. See &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Frady,&lt;/i&gt; 456 U. S. 152, 167-168 (1982) (holding that procedural default rules developed in the habeas corpus context apply &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*383&lt;/span&gt; in &#167; 2255 cases); see also &lt;i&gt;Reed&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Farley,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S. 339, 354&#151; 355 (1994).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Souter says that our holding here "rul[es] out the application of &#167; 2255 when the choice is relief under &#167; 2255 or no relief at all." &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 390 (dissenting opinion). This all-or-nothing characterization of the problem misses the point. As we have said, a defendant generally has ample opportunity to obtain constitutional review of a state conviction. &lt;i&gt;Supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 381. But once the "door" to such review "has been closed," &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 388, by the defendant &lt;i&gt;himself&lt;/i&gt; &#151; either because he failed to pursue otherwise available remedies or because he failed to prove a constitutional violation&#151; the conviction becomes final and the defendant is not entitled to another bite at the apple simply because that conviction is later used to enhance another sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the text of &#167; 2255 is broad enough to cover a claim that an enhanced federal sentence violates due process. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; See also n. 2, &lt;i&gt;infra.&lt;/i&gt; But when such a due process claim is predicated on the consideration at sentencing of a fully expired prior conviction, we think that the goals of easy administration and finality have ample "horsepower" to justify foreclosing relief under &#167; 2255. Were we to allow defendants sentenced under the ACCA to collaterally attack prior convictions through a &#167; 2255 motion, we would effectively permit challenges far too stale to be brought in their own right, and sanction an end run around statutes of limitations and other procedural barriers that would preclude the movant from attacking the prior conviction directly. Nothing in the Constitution or our precedent requires such a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;C&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognize that there may be rare cases in which no channel of review was actually available to a defendant with respect to a prior conviction, due to no fault of his own. The circumstances of this case do not require us to determine whether a defendant could use a motion under &#167; 2255 to challenge &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*384&lt;/span&gt; a federal sentence based on such a conviction.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Cf., &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2255 (1994 ed., Supp. V) (allowing a second or successive &#167; 2255 motion if there is "newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable fact finder would have found the movant guilty of the offense"); &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; (tolling 1-year limitation period while movant is prevented from making a &#167; 2255 motion by an "impediment . . . created by governmental action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No such claim is made here. The sole basis on which petitioner Daniels challenges his current federal sentence is that two of his prior state convictions were the products of inadequate guilty pleas and ineffective assistance of counsel. Petitioner could have pursued his claims while he was in custody on those convictions. As his counsel conceded at oral argument, there is no indication that petitioner did so or that he was prevented from doing so by some external force. Tr. of Oral Arg. 3-4, 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner's federal sentence was properly enhanced pursuant to the ACCA based on his four facially valid prior state convictions. Because petitioner failed to pursue remedies that were otherwise available to him to challenge his 1978 and 1981 convictions, he may not now use a &#167; 2255 motion to collaterally attack those convictions. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is therefore affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*385&lt;/span&gt; Justice Scalia, concurring in part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with the Court that 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2255 (1994 ed., Supp. V) does not (with the &lt;i&gt;Gideon&lt;/i&gt; exception, see &lt;i&gt;Gideon&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Wainwright,&lt;/i&gt; 372 U. S. 335 (1963)) permit inquiry into whether a conviction later used to enhance a federal sentence was unconstitutionally obtained, and I agree with the Court's reasoning so far as it goes. I have another reason for reaching that result, however, and one that prevents me from joining that portion of the Court's opinion which speculates that "[t]here may be rare circumstances in which &#167; 2255 would be available," such as when "no channel of review was actually available to a defendant with respect to a prior conviction, due to no fault of his own," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 376, 383. Simply put, "the text of &#167; 2255 is" &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; "broad enough to cover a claim that an enhanced federal sentence violates due process," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 383, if the enhancement is based on prior convictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the practical reasons Justice O'Connor identifies as counseling against petitioner's interpretation of &#167; 2255, there stands the very text of that provision. "[W]e have long recognized that `the power to award the writ [of habeas corpus] by any of the courts of the United States, must be given by written law,' " &lt;i&gt;Felker&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Turpin,&lt;/i&gt; 518 U. S. 651, 664 (1996), quoting &lt;i&gt;Ex parte Bollman,&lt;/i&gt; 4 Cranch 75, 94 (1807). Section 2255 authorizes a challenge by "[a] prisoner in custody under &lt;i&gt;sentence of a court established by Act of Congress&lt;/i&gt; claiming the right to be released upon the ground that &lt;i&gt;the sentence&lt;/i&gt; was &lt;i&gt;imposed&lt;/i&gt; in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States." (Emphases added.) We have already determined, in &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S. 485 (1994), that a sentencing court does not violate the Due Process Clause by imposing a sentence enhanced by prior, purportedly tainted, convictions, unless the taint is the result of a &lt;i&gt;Gideon&lt;/i&gt; violation.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; It follows ineluctably that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*386&lt;/span&gt; &#167; 2255 does not establish any right to challenge federal sentences based on their enhancement by stale, non-&lt;i&gt;Gideon&lt;/i&gt; tainted, convictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conclusion is reinforced (if reinforcement is possible) by comparing the text of &#167; 2255 with that of &#167; 2254. The latter, governing habeas challenges to state convictions, provides that "[t]he ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during Federal or State collateral postconviction proceedings shall not be a ground for relief in a proceeding arising under &#167; 2254." 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2254(i) (1994 ed., Supp. V). There is no conceivable reason why this bar would be placed upon challenges to state convictions under &#167; 2254, but not upon challenges to state convictions under &#167; 2255. Congress did not expect challenges to state convictions (used to enhance federal convictions) to be brought under &#167; 2255.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps precepts of fundamental fairness inherent in "due process" suggest that a forum to litigate challenges like petitioner's must be made available &lt;i&gt;somewhere&lt;/i&gt; for the odd case in which the challenge could not have been brought earlier. But it would not follow from this that federal sentencing must provide the remedy; much less that federal sentencing need not provide the remedy but &#167; 2255 (which is entirely dependent upon the impropriety of prior federal sentencing) &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*387&lt;/span&gt; must do so. Fundamental fairness could be achieved just as well&#151;indeed, better&#151;by holding that the rendering jurisdiction must provide a means for challenge when enhancement is threatened or has been imposed. Such a constitutional rule, combined with a rule that any sentence already imposed must be adjusted accordingly, would prevent sentencing hearings from being routinely complicated by inquiries into prior convictions, and would locate those inquiries where they can best be conducted: in the rendering jurisdiction. It would also avoid a possible gap in protection that would result from using &#167; 2255 (and in state-court cases, &#167; 2254) for this inappropriate purpose&#151;arising from the fact that, as discussed above, &#167; 2254 &lt;i&gt;cannot&lt;/i&gt; be used to remedy ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel. (We have left open the question whether such ineffective assistance can establish a constitutional violation, see &lt;i&gt;Coleman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Thompson,&lt;/i&gt; 501 U. S. 722, 755 (1991).) But &#167; 2255 cannot possibly be the means of relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, I join the opinion of the Court only in part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S. 485 (1994), we held that a federal defendant facing an enhanced sentence on the basis of prior state convictions under the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. &#167; 924(e), could not, with one exception, challenge the constitutionality of the underlying state convictions at his federal sentencing proceeding. &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; was thus a precursor of the case before us now; &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; is not, however, compelling authority for today's disposition. Although the Court's opinion in &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; struck me as portending more than it strictly held, a reading of the case free of portent was in fact the understanding of one Member of the &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; majority: "&lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; presented a forum question. The issue was &lt;i&gt;where,&lt;/i&gt; not &lt;i&gt;whether,&lt;/i&gt; the defendant could attack &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*388&lt;/span&gt; a prior conviction for constitutional infirmity." &lt;i&gt;Nichols&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S. 738, 765 (1994) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original). The door in &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; remained open to an attack on the prior state convictions, through a state or federal habeas challenge to the underlying convictions themselves. See &lt;i&gt;Custis, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 497 (Custis "was still `in custody' for purposes of his state convictions at the time of his federal sentencing under &#167; 924(e)," and could thus "attack his state sentences in Maryland or through federal habeas review"). This case presents the distinct question of what happens when that door has been closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court's reasons for reading 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2255 (1994 ed., Supp. V) as restrictively as it read the ACCA sentencing provisions have nothing to do either with the text of &#167; 2255 or with any extension of rules governing habeas review of state convictions under 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2254 (1994 ed. and Supp. V). The language of &#167; 2255 providing a federal prisoner with the right to relief because a sentence "was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States" is obviously broad enough to include a claim that a prior conviction used anew to mandate sentence enhancement under the ACCA was obtained unconstitutionally, so that the new sentence itself violates the terms of the ACCA or the Constitution.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Nor does the Court rest its exclusion of such claims &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*389&lt;/span&gt; from &#167; 2255 review on the theory that a &#167; 2255 petitioner who challenges underlying state convictions should be required, like a &#167; 2254 petitioner, to exhaust state remedies and to comply with state procedural rules. Cf. 28 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 2254(b)&#151;(c) (1994 ed. and Supp. V); &lt;i&gt;Rose&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lundy,&lt;/i&gt; 455 U. S. 509 (1982); &lt;i&gt;Coleman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Thompson,&lt;/i&gt; 501 U. S. 722 (1991). It is not clear, after all, that such requirements, premised largely on comity concerns and the State's interest in the finality of its own judgments, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 731-732, 750, should be imported into this context of a federal sentence imposed when a petitioner who has completed his state sentence seeks only to avoid a sentence enhancement under federal law. In any event, the Court does not purport to apply these specific requirements (which in the &#167; 2254 setting can be waived by the State, see 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2254(b)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V); &lt;i&gt;Gray&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Netherland,&lt;/i&gt; 518 U. S. 152, 165-166 (1996), and which are subject to explicit exceptions). Instead it imposes a flat ban on &#167; 2255 relief (subject, maybe, to narrow exceptions).&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having no textual basis or related precedent in habeas law, the Court rules out challenges to ACCA sentencing predicates under &#167; 2255 on the same grounds invoked earlier to bar such challenges under the sentencing provisions of the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*390&lt;/span&gt; ACCA itself: the ACCA ought to be easy to administer and state convictions ought to carry finality, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 378-380. But whatever force these reasons might have if alternative avenues of challenge were open, they do not even come close to the horsepower needed to rule out the application of &#167; 2255 when the choice is relief under &#167; 2255 or no relief at all. Why should it be easy to subject a person to a higher sentencing range and commit him for nearly nine extra years (as here) when the prisoner has a colorable claim that the extended commitment rests on a conviction the Constitution would condemn? If the answer is the value of finality in state convictions, why is finality valuable when state law itself does not demand it, and why is finality a one-way street? Why should a prisoner like Daniels suddenly be barred from returning to challenge the validity of a conviction, when the Government is free to reach back to it to impose extended imprisonment under a sentence enhancement law unheard of at the time of the earlier convictions (1978 and 1981 in this case)? Daniels could not have been expected in 1978 to anticipate the federal enhancement statute enacted in 1984; and even if he had been blessed with statutory clairvoyance, the practice in 1978 would have told him he could challenge the convictions when and if the Government sought to rely on them under the future enhancement statute. The ACCA was enacted against the backdrop of a pervasive federal practice of entertaining constitutional challenges to prior convictions when used anew for sentence enhancement, a practice on which Congress threw no cold water when it enacted the ACCA. See &lt;i&gt;Custis,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S., at 499-501 (Souter, J.,dissenting). Indeed, even the Court seems to find something disquieting in the historical practice, as it shows by recognizing a textually untethered exception to its own rule, one allowing for collateral attacks on prior convictions if based on violations of the right to counsel under &lt;i&gt;Gideon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wainwright,&lt;/i&gt; 372 U. S. 335 (1963). See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 382. I suppose &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*391&lt;/span&gt; I should not begrudge the Court's concession, but the &lt;i&gt;Gideon&lt;/i&gt; exception, first announced in &lt;i&gt;Custis,&lt;/i&gt; is inexplicable here. One might have argued in &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; that a &lt;i&gt;Gideon&lt;/i&gt; violation was egregious enough to excuse the defendant's failure to resort to other forums still open; but there is no excuse for picking and choosing among constitutional violations here, when other forums are closed. The need to address &lt;i&gt;Gideon&lt;/i&gt; is no reason to ignore &lt;i&gt;Moore&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dempsey,&lt;/i&gt; 261 U. S. 86 (1923), or &lt;i&gt;Mooney&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Holohan,&lt;/i&gt; 294 U. S. 103 (1935) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Brown&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mississippi,&lt;/i&gt; 297 U. S. 278 (1936), or &lt;i&gt;Strickland&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Washington,&lt;/i&gt; 466 U. S. 668 (1984), or &lt;i&gt;Miranda&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Arizona,&lt;/i&gt; 384 U. S. 436 (1966), or &lt;i&gt;Brady&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maryland,&lt;/i&gt; 373 U. S. 83 (1963), or any other recognized violations of the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is to say that the Court is wrong to recognize that collateral review of old state convictions can be very cumbersome. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 379. But that is not the only practical consideration in the real world we confront (or ought to confront) here. A defendant under the ACCA has generally paid whatever penalty the old conviction entailed; he may well have forgone direct challenge because the penalty was not practically worth challenging, and may well have passed up collateral attack because he had no counsel to speak for him. But when faced with the ACCA's 15-year mandatory minimum the old conviction is suddenly well worth challenging and counsel may be available under 18 U. S. C. &#167; 3006A(a)(2)(B). In denying him any right to attack convictions later when attacks are worth the trouble, the Court adopts a policy of promoting challenges earlier when they may not justify the effort and perhaps never will. That is a very odd incentive for a court to create, and the eccentricity is hardly softened by the likelihood that most defendants will not notice before it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's decision is devoid of support in either statutory language or congressional intention. I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*392&lt;/span&gt; Justice Breyer, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that Congress intended courts to read the silences in federal sentencing statutes as permitting defendants to challenge the validity of an earlier sentenceenhancing conviction &lt;i&gt;at the time of sentencing.&lt;/i&gt; See &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Paleo,&lt;/i&gt; 967 F. 2d 7, 11-13 (CA1 1992), implicitly overruled by &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S. 485 (1994). That was the practice typically followed in the lower courts before &lt;i&gt;Custis.&lt;/i&gt; See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 498-499, and n. 2, 511 (Souter, J.,dissenting). The courts now follow a comparable practice in respect to other sentence-enhancing factors. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dunnigan,&lt;/i&gt; 507 U. S. 87, 95-97 (1993) (perjured testimony enhancement). And, given appropriate burden of proof rules, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gilbert,&lt;/i&gt; 20 F. 3d 94, 100 (CA3 1994); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wicks,&lt;/i&gt; 995 F. 2d 964, 978 (CA10), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 982 (1993); &lt;i&gt;Paleo, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 13 (citing &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Henry,&lt;/i&gt; 933 F. 2d 553, 559 (CA7 1991), cert. denied, 503 U. S. 997 (1992); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gallman,&lt;/i&gt; 907 F. 2d 639, 643 (CA7 1990), cert. denied, 499 U. S. 908 (1991); and &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Taylor,&lt;/i&gt; 882 F. 2d 1018, 1031 (CA6 1989), cert. denied, 496 U. S. 907 (1990)), that practice need not prove unusually burdensome, see &lt;i&gt;Custis, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 511 (Souter, J., dissenting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having rejected that procedural approach in &lt;i&gt;Custis, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 496-497, the Court now must face the alternative&#151; a later challenge to the earlier convictions in a collateral proceeding that attacks the present conviction or sentence. To resolve that challenge the plurality has devised a broad rule immunizing the earlier conviction with a possible exception for "rare" circumstances. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 383. The rule may well prove unduly "restrictiv[e]," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 388 (Souter, J., dissenting). Or, through exceptions, it may well bring about additional delay, still greater litigation complexity, and (insofar as the plurality ties Congress' hands by resting its exception upon constitutional grounds) legal inflexibility. And, given the restrictions &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; placed on sentencing courts, the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*393&lt;/span&gt; inclination to grant a 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2255 (1994 ed., Supp. V) hearing in the rare circumstances hypothesized by the majority is subject to Justice Scalia's criticism that &#167; 2255 may be an inappropriate forum for such a challenge. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 387 (opinion concurring in part).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal problem lies at the source. While we do not often overturn a recently decided case, in this instance the Court's earlier decision will lead to ever-increasing complexity, for it blocks the simpler procedural approach that Congress intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, I believe this is one of those rare instances in which the Court should reconsider an earlier case, namely, &lt;i&gt;Custis,&lt;/i&gt; and adopt the dissenters' views. For that reason, I dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   &lt;i&gt;Kent S. Scheidegger&lt;/i&gt; filed a brief for the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging affirmance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Justice Souter is concerned that a defendant may forgo "direct challenge because the penalty was not practically worth challenging, and . . . collateral attack because he had no counsel to speak for him." &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 391 (dissenting opinion). Whatever incentives may exist at the time of conviction, the fact remains that avenues of redress are generally available if sought in a timely manner. If a person chooses not to pursue those remedies, he does so with the knowledge that the conviction will stay on his record. This knowledge should serve as an incentive not to commit a subsequent crime and risk having the sentence for that crime enhanced under a recidivist sentencing statute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  After comparing the text of &#167;&#167; 2254 and 2255, Justice Scalia concludes that "Congress did not expect challenges to state convictions (used to enhance federal convictions) to be brought under &#167; 2255." &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 386 (opinion concurring in part). This is, of course, true.But it is also beside the point, as the subject of the &#167; 2255 motion in this circumstance is the enhanced federal sentence, not the prior state conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   Justice Souter asserts that &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; "merely held (with [the] exception [of &lt;i&gt;Gideon&lt;/i&gt; violations]) that neither the ACCA nor the Constitution provides a forum at the sentencing hearing for challenges to the underlying conviction." &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 388, n. 1 (dissenting opinion).But the Constitution &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; "provide a forum" at the sentencing hearing if it were &lt;i&gt;unconstitutional&lt;/i&gt; to sentence on the basis of invalid but nonetheless outstanding prior convictions. (Assuredly the Constitution does not permit unconstitutional acts.) &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; necessarily held, therefore, that it is not unconstitutional (with the &lt;i&gt;Gideon&lt;/i&gt; exception) to sentence on the basis of invalid but nonetheless outstanding prior convictions. Justice Souter apparently understood this at the time &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; was decided. His dissent began: "The Court answers a difficult constitutional question that I believe the underlying statute does notpose," 511 U. S., at 498, which question turns out to be "whether the Constitution permits courts to enhance a defendant's sentence on the basis of a prior conviction the defendant can show was obtained in violation of his right to effective assistance of counsel," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 505.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The Government argues, citing &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S. 485 (1994), that 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2255 (1994 ed., Supp. V) does not provide a remedy here because "the Constitution is not violated when a conviction that is facially valid is used to enhance a sentence for committing another crime." Brief for United States 12. This misstates the holding of &lt;i&gt;Custis,&lt;/i&gt; which merely held (with one exception discussed below) that neither the ACCA nor the Constitution provides a forum at the sentencing hearing for challenges to the underlying conviction. 511 U. S., at 487. The constitutional holding was necessarily limited to the statutory scheme considered. And, in any event, &#167; 2255 provides an explicit remedy for a sentence that violates federal law, not solely the Constitution. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Hill&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt;  368 U. S. 424, 428 (1962) (describing types of fundamental errors that are cognizable under &#167; 2255). Neither the &lt;i&gt;Custis&lt;/i&gt; Court nor today's Court takes the position that the ACCA properly applies, as a statutory matter, to underlying sentences that are infact invalid. See &lt;i&gt;Custis, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 497; &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 382. The language of &#167; 2255 invites a petitioner to establish such a statutory violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The Court continues to leave the door open (but with no promises) to a motion to revise an ACCA sentence if a defendant has first obtained an order vacating the predicate conviction through a state collateral proceeding or federal habeas review of the state judgment under 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2254 (1994 ed. and Supp. V). See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 382; &lt;i&gt;Custis, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 497. The plurality adds the possibility of an exception to today's rule if a petitioner can show newly discovered evidence or legal disability during the period of state custody. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 383-384. These exceptions will not eclipse the rule.&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*277&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*277&lt;/span&gt; Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined. Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 293.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jeffrey S. Sutton&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Bill Pryor,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General of Alabama, and &lt;i&gt;John J. Park, Jr.,&lt;/i&gt; Assistant Attorney General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eric Schnapper&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for private respondents. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;J. Richard Cohen, Rhonda Brownstein, Steven R. Shapiro, Edward Chen,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Christopher Ho.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States as respondent under this Court's Rule 12.6. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Assistant Attorney General Lee, Deputy Solicitor General Underwood, Paul R. Q. Wolfson, Dennis J. Dimsey,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Seth M. Galanter.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*278&lt;/span&gt; Justice Scalia, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case presents the question whether private individuals may sue to enforce disparate-impact regulations promulgated under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Alabama Department of Public Safety (Department), of which petitioner James Alexander is the director, accepted grants of financial assistance from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of Transportation (DOT) and so subjected itself to the restrictions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, as amended, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000d &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; Section 601 of that Title provides that no person shall, "on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity" covered by Title VI. 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000d. Section 602 authorizes federal agencies "to effectuate the provisions of [&#167; 601] . . . by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability," 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000d&#151;1, and the DOJ in an exercise of this authority promulgated a regulation forbidding funding recipients to "utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin . . . ." 28 CFR &#167; 42.104(b)(2) (2000). See also 49 CFR &#167; 21.5(b)(2) (2000) (similar DOT regulation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State of Alabama amended its Constitution in 1990 to declare English "the official language of the state of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*279&lt;/span&gt; Alabama." Amdt. 509. Pursuant to this provision and, petitioners have argued, to advance public safety, the Department decided to administer state driver's license examinations only in English. Respondent Sandoval, as representative of a class, brought suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama to enjoin the English-only policy, arguing that it violated the DOJ regulation because it had the effect of subjecting non-English speakers to discrimination based on their national origin. The District Court agreed. It enjoined the policy and ordered the Department to accommodate non-English speakers. &lt;i&gt;Sandoval&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hagan,&lt;/i&gt; 7 F. Supp. 2d 1234 (1998). Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which affirmed. &lt;i&gt;Sandoval&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hagan,&lt;/i&gt; 197 F. 3d 484 (1999). Both courts rejected petitioners' argument that Title VI did not provide respondents a cause of action to enforce the regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not inquire here whether the DOJ regulation was authorized by &#167; 602, or whether the courts below were correct to hold that the English-only policy had the effect of discriminating on the basis of national origin. The petition for writ of certiorari raised, and we agreed to review, only the question posed in the first paragraph of this opinion: whether there is a private cause of action to enforce the regulation. 530 U. S. 1305 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Title VI has often come to this Court, it is fair to say (indeed, perhaps an understatement) that our opinions have not eliminated all uncertainty regarding its commands. For purposes of the present case, however, it is clear from our decisions, from Congress's amendments of Title VI, and from the parties' concessions that three aspects of Title VI must be taken as given. First, private individuals may sue to enforce &#167; 601 of Title VI and obtain both injunctive relief and damages. In &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;University of Chicago,&lt;/i&gt; 441 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*280&lt;/span&gt; U. S. 677 (1979), the Court held that a private right of action existed to enforce Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, as amended, 20 U. S. C. &#167; 1681 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; The reasoning of that decision embraced the existence of a private right to enforce Title VI as well. "Title IX," the Court noted, "was patterned after Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964." 441 U. S., at 694. And, "[i]n 1972 when Title IX was enacted, the [parallel] language in Title VI had already been construed as creating a private remedy." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 696. That meant, the Court reasoned, that Congress had intended Title IX, like Title VI, to provide a private cause of action. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 699, 703, 710-711. Congress has since ratified &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; `s holding. Section 1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 100 Stat. 1845, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000d&#151;7, expressly abrogated States' sovereign immunity against suits brought in federal court to enforce Title VI and provided that in a suit against a State "remedies (including remedies both at law and in equity) are available . . . to the same extent as such remedies are available . . . in the suit against any public or private entity other than a State," &#167; 2000d&#151;7(a)(2). We recognized in &lt;i&gt;Franklin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gwinnett County Public Schools,&lt;/i&gt; 503 U. S. 60 (1992), that &#167; 2000d&#151;7 "cannot be read except as a validation of &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; `s holding." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 72; see also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 78 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (same). It is thus beyond dispute that private individuals may sue to enforce &#167; 601.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it is similarly beyond dispute&#151;and no party disagrees&#151;that &#167; 601 prohibits only intentional discrimination. In &lt;i&gt;Regents of Univ. of Cal.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bakke,&lt;/i&gt; 438 U. S. 265 (1978), the Court reviewed a decision of the California Supreme Court that had enjoined the University of California Medical School from "according any consideration to race in its admissions process." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 272. Essential to the Court's holding reversing that aspect of the California court's decision was the determination that &#167; 601 "proscribe[s] only those racial classifications that would violate the Equal Protection &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*281&lt;/span&gt; Clause or the Fifth Amendment." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 287 (opinion of Powell, J.); see also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 325, 328, 352 (opinion of Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.). In &lt;i&gt;Guardians Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S. 582 (1983), the Court made clear that under &lt;i&gt;Bakke&lt;/i&gt; only intentional discrimination was forbidden by &#167; 601. 463 U. S., at 610-611 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 612 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 642 (Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting). What we said in &lt;i&gt;Alexander&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Choate,&lt;/i&gt; 469 U. S. 287, 293 (1985), is true today: "Title VI itself directly reach[es] only instances of intentional discrimination."&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, we must assume for purposes of deciding this case that regulations promulgated under &#167; 602 of Title VI may validly proscribe activities that have a disparate impact on racial groups, even though such activities are permissible under &#167; 601. Though no opinion of this Court has held that, five Justices in &lt;i&gt;Guardians&lt;/i&gt; voiced that view of the law at &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*282&lt;/span&gt; least as alternative grounds for their decisions, see 463 U. S., at 591-592 (opinion of White, J.); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 623, n. 15 (Marshall, J., dissenting); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 643-645 (Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting), and dictum in &lt;i&gt;Alexander&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Choate&lt;/i&gt; is to the same effect, see 469 U. S., at 293, 295, n. 11. These statements are in considerable tension with the rule of &lt;i&gt;Bakke&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Guardians&lt;/i&gt; that &#167; 601 forbids only intentional discrimination, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Guardians Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 612-613 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment), but petitioners have not challenged the regulations here. We therefore assume for the purposes of deciding this case that the DOJ and DOT regulations proscribing activities that have a disparate impact on the basis of race are valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondents assert that the issue in this case, like the first two described above, has been resolved by our cases. To reject a private cause of action to enforce the disparateimpact regulations, they say, we would "[have] to ignore the actual language of &lt;i&gt;Guardians&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cannon.&lt;/i&gt; " Brief for Respondents 13. The language in &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; to which respondents refer does not in fact support their position, as we shall discuss at length below, see &lt;i&gt;infra,&lt;/i&gt; at 288-290. But in any event, this Court is bound by holdings, not language. &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; was decided on the assumption that the University of Chicago had intentionally discriminated against petitioner. See 441 U. S., at 680 (noting that respondents "admitted &lt;i&gt;arguendo&lt;/i&gt; " that petitioner's "applications for admission to medical school were denied by the respondents because she is a woman"). It therefore &lt;i&gt;held&lt;/i&gt; that Title IX created a private right of action to enforce its ban on intentional discrimination, but had no occasion to consider whether the right reached regulations barring disparate-impact discrimination.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Guardians,&lt;/i&gt; the Court &lt;i&gt;held&lt;/i&gt; that private individuals &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*283&lt;/span&gt; could not recover compensatory damages under Title VI except for intentional discrimination. Five Justices in addition voted to uphold the disparate-impact regulations (four would have declared them invalid, see 463 U. S., at 611, n. 5 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 612-614 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)), but of those five, three expressly reserved the question of a direct private right of action to enforce the regulations, saying that "[w]hether a cause of action against private parties exists directly under the regulations . . .[is a] questio[n] that [is] not presented by this case." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 645, n. 18 (Stevens, J., dissenting).&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Thus, only two Justices had cause to reach the issue &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*284&lt;/span&gt; that respondents say the "actual language" of &lt;i&gt;Guardians&lt;/i&gt;  resolves. Neither that case,&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; nor any other in this Court, has held that the private right of action exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor does it follow straightaway from the three points we have taken as given that Congress must have intended a private right of action to enforce disparate-impact regulations. We do not doubt that regulations applying &#167; 601's ban on intentional discrimination are covered by the cause of action to enforce that section. Such regulations, if valid and reasonable, authoritatively construe the statute itself, see &lt;i&gt;Nations Bank of N. C., N. A.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 513 U. S. 251, 257 (1995); &lt;i&gt;Chevron U. S. A. Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 837, 843-844 (1984), and it is therefore meaningless to talk about a separate cause of action to enforce the regulations apart from the statute. A Congress that intends the statute to be enforced through a private cause of action intends the authoritative interpretation of the statute to be so enforced as well. The many cases that respondents say have "assumed" that a cause of action to enforce a statute includes one to enforce its regulations illustrate (to the extent that cases in which an issue was not presented can illustrate anything) only this point; each involved regulations of the type we have just described, as respondents conceded at oral argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. See &lt;i&gt;National Collegiate Athletic Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Smith,&lt;/i&gt; 525 U. S. 459, 468 (1999) (regulation defining who is a "recipient" under Title IX); &lt;i&gt;School Bd. of Nassau Cty.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Arline,&lt;/i&gt; 480 U. S. 273, 279-281 (1987) (regulations defining the terms "physical impairment" and "major life activities" in &#167; 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973); &lt;i&gt;Bazemore&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Friday,&lt;/i&gt;  478 U. S. 385, 408-409 (1986) (White, J., joined by four other &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*285&lt;/span&gt; Justices, concurring) (regulation interpreting Title VI to require "affirmative action" remedying effects of intentional discrimination); &lt;i&gt;Alexander&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Choate,&lt;/i&gt; 469 U. S., at 299, 309 (regulations clarifying what sorts of disparate impacts upon the handicapped were covered by &#167; 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which the Court assumed included some such impacts). Our decision in &lt;i&gt;Lau&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Nichols,&lt;/i&gt; 414 U. S. 563 (1974), falls within the same category. The Title VI regulations at issue in &lt;i&gt;Lau,&lt;/i&gt; similar to the ones at issue here, forbade funding recipients to take actions which had the effect of discriminating on the basis of race, color, or national origin. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 568. Unlike our later cases, however, the Court in &lt;i&gt;Lau&lt;/i&gt; interpreted &#167; 601 itself to proscribe disparate-impact discrimination, saying that it "rel[ied] solely on &#167; 601 . . . to reverse the Court of Appeals," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 566, and that the disparate-impact regulations simply "[made] sure that recipients of federal aid . . . conduct[ed] any federally financed projects consistently with &#167; 601," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 567.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must face now the question avoided by &lt;i&gt;Lau,&lt;/i&gt; because we have since rejected &lt;i&gt;Lau&lt;/i&gt; `s interpretation of &#167; 601 as reaching beyond intentional discrimination. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 280&#151; 281. It is clear now that the disparate-impact regulations do not simply apply &#167; 601&#151;since they indeed forbid conduct that &#167; 601 permits&#151;and therefore clear that the private right of action to enforce &#167; 601 does not include a private right to enforce these regulations. See &lt;i&gt;Central Bank of Denver,&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*286&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;N. A.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A.,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S. 164, 173 (1994) (a "private plaintiff may not bring a [suit based on a regulation] against a defendant for acts not prohibited by the text of [the statute]"). That right must come, if at all, from the independent force of &#167; 602. As stated earlier, we assume for purposes of this decision that &#167; 602 confers the authority to promulgate disparate-impact regulations;&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; the question remains whether it confers a private right of action to enforce them. If not, we must conclude that a failure to comply with regulations promulgated under &#167; 602 that is not also a failure to comply with &#167; 601 is not actionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implicit in our discussion thus far has been a particular understanding of the genesis of private causes of action. Like substantive federal law itself, private rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by Congress. &lt;i&gt;Touche Ross &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Redington,&lt;/i&gt; 442 U. S. 560, 578 (1979) (remedies available are those "that Congress enacted into law"). The judicial task is to interpret the statute Congress has passed to determine whether it displays an intent to create not just a private right but also a private remedy. &lt;i&gt;Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lewis,&lt;/i&gt; 444 U. S. 11, 15 (1979). Statutory intent on this latter point is determinative. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Virginia Bankshares, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sandberg,&lt;/i&gt; 501 U. S. 1083, 1102 (1991); &lt;i&gt;Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Thompson,&lt;/i&gt; 478 U. S. 804, 812, n. 9 (1986) (collecting cases). Without it, a cause of action does not exist and courts may not &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*287&lt;/span&gt; create one, no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter, or how compatible with the statute. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Russell,&lt;/i&gt; 473 U. S. 134, 145, 148 (1985); &lt;i&gt;Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lewis, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 23; &lt;i&gt;Touche Ross &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Redington, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 575-576. "Raising up causes of action where a statute has not created them may be a proper function for commonlaw courts, but not for federal tribunals." &lt;i&gt;Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp;amp; Petigrow&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gilbertson,&lt;/i&gt; 501 U. S. 350, 365 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondents would have us revert in this case to the understanding of private causes of action that held sway 40 years ago when Title VI was enacted. That understanding is captured by the Court's statement in &lt;i&gt;J. I. Case Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Borak,&lt;/i&gt; 377 U. S. 426, 433 (1964), that "it is the duty of the courts to be alert to provide such remedies as are necessary to make effective the congressional purpose" expressed by a statute. We abandoned that understanding in &lt;i&gt;Cort&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ash,&lt;/i&gt;  422 U. S. 66, 78 (1975)&#151;which itself interpreted a statute enacted under the &lt;i&gt;ancien regime&lt;/i&gt; &#151;and have not returned to it since. Not even when interpreting the same Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that was at issue in &lt;i&gt;Borak&lt;/i&gt; have we applied &lt;i&gt;Borak&lt;/i&gt; `s method for discerning and defining causes of action. See &lt;i&gt;Central Bank of Denver, N. A.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 188; &lt;i&gt;Musick, Peeler &amp;amp; Garrett&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Employers Ins. of Wausau,&lt;/i&gt; 508 U. S. 286, 291-293 (1993); &lt;i&gt;Virginia Bankshares, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sandberg, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 1102-1103; &lt;i&gt;Touche Ross &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Redington, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 576&#151; 578. Having sworn off the habit of venturing beyond Congress's intent, we will not accept respondents' invitation to have one last drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor do we agree with the Government that our cases interpreting statutes enacted prior to &lt;i&gt;Cort&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ash&lt;/i&gt; have given "dispositive weight" to the "expectations" that the enacting Congress had formed "in light of the `contemporary legal &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*288&lt;/span&gt; context.' " Brief for United States 14. Only three of our legion implied-right-of-action cases have found this sort of "contemporary legal context" relevant, and two of those involved Congress's enactment (or reenactment) of the verbatim statutory text that courts had previously interpreted to create a private right of action. See &lt;i&gt;Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp;amp; Smith, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Curran,&lt;/i&gt; 456 U. S. 353, 378&#151; 379 (1982); &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;University of Chicago,&lt;/i&gt; 441 U. S., at 698-699. In the third case, this sort of "contemporary legal context" simply buttressed a conclusion independently supported by the text of the statute. See &lt;i&gt;Thompson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Thompson,&lt;/i&gt; 484 U. S. 174 (1988). We have never accorded dispositive weight to context shorn of text. In determining whether statutes create private rights of action, as in interpreting statutes generally, see &lt;i&gt;Blatchford&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Native Village of Noatak,&lt;/i&gt; 501 U. S. 775, 784 (1991), legal context matters only to the extent it clarifies text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We therefore begin (and find that we can end) our search for Congress's intent with the text and structure of Title VI.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; Section 602 authorizes federal agencies "to effectuate the provisions of [&#167; 601] . . . by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000d&#151;1. It is immediately clear that the "rights-creating" language so critical to the Court's analysis in &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; of &#167; 601, see 441 U. S., at 690, n. 13, is completely absent from &#167; 602. Whereas &#167; 601 decrees that "[n]o person . . . shall . . . be subjected to discrimination," 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000d, the text of &#167; 602 provides that "[e]ach Federal department and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*289&lt;/span&gt; agency . . . is authorized and directed to effectuate the provisions of [&#167; 601]," 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000d&#151;1. Far from displaying congressional intent to create new rights, &#167; 602 limits agencies to "effectuat[ing]" rights already created by &#167; 601. And the focus of &#167; 602 is twice removed from the individuals who will ultimately benefit from Title VI's protection. Statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than the individuals protected create "no implication of an intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons." &lt;i&gt;California&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sierra Club,&lt;/i&gt; 451 U. S. 287, 294 (1981). Section 602 is yet a step further removed: It focuses neither on the individuals protected nor even on the funding recipients being regulated, but on the agencies that will do the regulating. Like the statute found not to create a right of action in &lt;i&gt;Universities Research Assn., Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Coutu,&lt;/i&gt; 450 U. S. 754 (1981), &#167; 602 is "phrased as a directive to federal agencies engaged in the distribution of public funds," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 772. When this is true, "[t]here [is] far less reason to infer a private remedy in favor of individual persons," &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;University of Chicago, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 690-691. So far as we can tell, this authorizing portion of &#167; 602 reveals no congressional intent to create a private right of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor do the methods that &#167; 602 goes on to provide for enforcing its authorized regulations manifest an intent to create a private remedy; if anything, they suggest the opposite. Section 602 empowers agencies to enforce their regulations either by terminating funding to the "particular program, or part thereof," that has violated the regulation or "by any other means authorized by law," 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000d&#151;1. No enforcement action may be taken, however, "until the department or agency concerned has advised the appropriate person or persons of the failure to comply with the requirement and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; And every agency enforcement action is subject to judicial review. &#167; 2000d&#151;2. If an agency attempts to terminate program funding, still &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*290&lt;/span&gt; more restrictions apply. The agency head must "file with the committees of the House and Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action." &#167; 2000d&#151;1. And the termination of funding does not "become effective until thirty days have elapsed after the filing of such report." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Whatever these elaborate restrictions on agency enforcement may imply for the private enforcement of rights created &lt;i&gt;outside&lt;/i&gt; of &#167; 602, compare &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;University of Chicago, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 706, n. 41, 712, n. 49; &lt;i&gt;Regents of Univ. of Cal.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bakke,&lt;/i&gt; 438 U. S., at 419, n. 26 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), with &lt;i&gt;Guardians Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S., at 609-610 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment); &lt;i&gt;Regents of Univ. of Cal.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bakke, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 382-383 (opinion of White, J.), they tend to contradict a congressional intent to create privately enforceable rights through &#167; 602 itself. The express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that Congress intended to preclude others. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Karahalios&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Federal Employees,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 527, 533 (1989); &lt;i&gt;Northwest Airlines, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Transport Workers,&lt;/i&gt; 451 U. S. 77, 93-94 (1981); &lt;i&gt;Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lewis,&lt;/i&gt; 444 U. S., at 19-20. Sometimes the suggestion is so strong that it precludes a finding of congressional intent to create a private right of action, even though other aspects of the statute (such as language making the would-be plaintiff "a member of the class for whose benefit the statute was enacted") suggest the contrary. &lt;i&gt;Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Russell,&lt;/i&gt; 473 U. S., at 145; see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 146-147. And as our Rev. Stat. &#167; 1979, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1983, cases show, some remedial schemes foreclose a private cause of action to enforce even those statutes that admittedly create substantive private rights. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Middlesex County Sewerage Authority&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;National Sea Clammers Assn.,&lt;/i&gt; 453 U. S. 1, 19-20 (1981). In the present case, the claim of exclusivity for the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*291&lt;/span&gt; express remedial scheme does not even have to overcome such obstacles. The question whether &#167; 602's remedial scheme can overbear other evidence of congressional intent is simply not presented, since we have found no evidence anywhere in the text to suggest that Congress intended to create a private right to enforce regulations promulgated under &#167; 602.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Government and respondents argue that the &lt;i&gt;regulations&lt;/i&gt; contain rights-creating language and so must be privately enforceable, see Brief for United States 19-20; Brief for Respondents 31, but that argument skips an analytical step. Language in a regulation may invoke a private right of action that Congress through statutory text created, but it may not create a right that Congress has not. &lt;i&gt;Touche Ross &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Redington,&lt;/i&gt; 442 U. S., at 577, n. 18 ("[T]he language of the statute and not the rules must control"). Thus, when a statute has provided a general authorization for private enforcement of regulations, it may perhaps be correct that the intent displayed in each regulation can determine whether or not it is privately enforceable. But it is most certainly incorrect to say that language in a regulation can conjure up a private cause of action that has not been authorized by Congress. Agencies may play the sorcerer's apprentice but not the sorcerer himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last string to respondents' and the Government's bow is their argument that two amendments to Title VI "ratified" this Court's decisions finding an implied private right of action to enforce the disparate-impact regulations. See Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, &#167; 1003, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000d&#151;7; Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, &#167; 6, 102 Stat. 31, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000d&#151;4a. One problem with this argument is that, as explained above, none of our decisions establishes (or even assumes) the private right of action at issue here, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 282-285, which is why in &lt;i&gt;Guardians&lt;/i&gt; three Justices were able expressly to reserve the question. See 463 U. S., at 645, n. 18 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Incorporating &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*292&lt;/span&gt; our cases in the amendments would thus not help respondents. Another problem is that the incorporation claim itself is flawed. Section 1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, on which only respondents rely, by its terms applies only to suits "for a violation of a &lt;i&gt;statute,&lt;/i&gt; " 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000d&#151;7(a)(2) (emphasis added). It therefore does not speak to suits for violations of regulations that go beyond the statutory proscription of &#167; 601. Section 6 of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 is even less on point. That provision amends Title VI to make the term "program or activity" cover larger portions of the institutions receiving federal financial aid than it had previously covered, see &lt;i&gt;Grove City College&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bell,&lt;/i&gt; 465 U. S. 555 (1984). It is impossible to understand what this has to do with implied causes of action&#151;which is why we declared in &lt;i&gt;Franklin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gwinnett County Public Schools,&lt;/i&gt; 503 U. S., at 73, that &#167; 6 did not "in any way alte[r] the existing rights of action and the corresponding remedies permissible under . . . Title VI." Respondents point to &lt;i&gt;Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp;amp; Smith, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Curran,&lt;/i&gt; 456 U. S., at 381-382, which inferred congressional intent to ratify lower court decisions regarding a particular statutory provision when Congress comprehensively revised the statutory scheme but did not amend that provision. But we recently criticized &lt;i&gt;Curran&lt;/i&gt; `s reliance on congressional inaction, saying that "[a]s a general matter . . . [the] argumen[t] deserve[s] little weight in the interpretive process." &lt;i&gt;Central Bank of Denver, N. A.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A.,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S., at 187. And when, as here, Congress has not comprehensively revised a statutory scheme but has made only isolated amendments, we have spoken more bluntly: "It is `impossible to assert with any degree of assurance that congressional failure to act represents' affirmative congressional approval of the Court's statutory interpretation." &lt;i&gt;Patterson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McLean Credit Union,&lt;/i&gt; 491 U. S. 164, 175, n. 1 (1989) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Johnson&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*293&lt;/span&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Transportation Agency, Santa Clara Cty.,&lt;/i&gt; 480 U. S. 616, 671-672 (1987) (Scalia, J., dissenting)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither as originally enacted nor as later amended does Title VI display an intent to create a freestanding private right of action to enforce regulations promulgated under &#167; 602.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; We therefore hold that no such right of action exists. Since we reach this conclusion applying our standard test for discerning private causes of action, we do not address petitioners' additional argument that implied causes of action against States (and perhaps nonfederal state actors generally) are inconsistent with the clear statement rule of &lt;i&gt;Pennhurst State School and Hospital&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Halderman,&lt;/i&gt; 451 U. S. 1 (1981). See &lt;i&gt;Davis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Monroe County Bd. of Ed.,&lt;/i&gt; 526 U. S. 629, 656-657, 684-685 (1999) (Kennedy, J., dissenting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1964, as part of a ground breaking and comprehensive civil rights Act, Congress prohibited recipients of federal funds from discriminating on the basis of race, ethnicity, or national origin. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 2000d to 2000d&#151;7. Pursuant to powers &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*294&lt;/span&gt; expressly delegated by that Act, the federal agencies and departments responsible for awarding and administering federal contracts immediately adopted regulations prohibiting federal contractees from adopting policies that have the "effect" of discriminating on those bases. At the time of the promulgation of these regulations, prevailing principles of statutory construction assumed that Congress intended a private right of action whenever such a cause of action was necessary to protect individual rights granted by valid federal law. Relying both on this presumption and on independent analysis of Title VI, this Court has repeatedly and consistently affirmed the right of private individuals to bring civil suits to enforce rights guaranteed by Title VI. A fair reading of those cases, and coherent implementation of the statutory scheme, requires the same result under Title VI's implementing regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In separate lawsuits spanning several decades, we have endorsed an action identical in substance to the one brought in this case, see &lt;i&gt;Lau&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Nichols,&lt;/i&gt; 414 U. S. 563 (1974); demonstrated that Congress intended a private right of action to protect the rights guaranteed by Title VI, see &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;University of Chicago,&lt;/i&gt; 441 U. S. 677 (1979); and concluded that private individuals may seek declaratory and injunctive relief against state officials for violations of regulations promulgated pursuant to Title VI, see &lt;i&gt;Guardians Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S. 582 (1983). Giving fair import to our language and our holdings, every Court of Appeals to address the question has concluded that a private right of action exists to enforce the rights guaranteed both by the text of Title VI and by any regulations validly promulgated pursuant to that Title, and Congress has adopted several statutes that appear to ratify the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, in a decision unfounded in our precedent and hostile to decades of settled expectations, a majority of this Court carves out an important exception to the right of private action long recognized under Title VI. In so doing, the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*295&lt;/span&gt; Court makes three distinct, albeit interrelated, errors. First, the Court provides a muddled account of both the reasoning and the breadth of our prior decisions endorsing a private right of action under Title VI, thereby obscuring the conflict between those opinions and today's decision. Second, the Court offers a flawed and unconvincing analysis of the relationship between &#167;&#167; 601 and 602 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, ignoring more plausible and persuasive explanations detailed in our prior opinions. Finally, the Court badly misconstrues the theoretical linchpin of our decision in &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;University of Chicago,&lt;/i&gt; 441 U. S. 677 (1979), mistaking that decision's careful contextual analysis for judicial fiat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority is undoubtedly correct that this Court has never said in so many words that a private right of action exists to enforce the disparate-impact regulations promulgated under &#167; 602. However, the failure of our cases to state this conclusion explicitly does not absolve the Court of the responsibility to canvass our prior opinions for guidance. Reviewing these opinions with the care they deserve, I reach the same conclusion as the Courts of Appeals: This Court has already considered the question presented today and concluded that a private right of action exists.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*296&lt;/span&gt; When this Court faced an identical case 27 years ago, all the Justices believed that private parties could bring lawsuits under Title VI and its implementing regulations to enjoin the provision of governmental services in a manner that discriminated against non-English speakers. See &lt;i&gt;Lau&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Nichols,&lt;/i&gt; 414 U. S. 563 (1974). While five Justices saw no need to go beyond the command of &#167; 601, Chief Justice Burger, Justice Stewart, and Justice Blackmun relied specifically and exclusively on the regulations to support the private action, see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 569 (Stewart, J., concurring in result) (citing &lt;i&gt;Mourning&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Family Publications Service, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt;  411 U. S. 356, 369 (1973); &lt;i&gt;Thorpe&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Housing Authority of Durham,&lt;/i&gt; 393 U. S. 268, 280-281 (1969)). There is nothing in the majority's opinion in &lt;i&gt;Lau,&lt;/i&gt; or in earlier opinions of the Court, that is not fully consistent with the analysis of the concurring Justices or that would have differentiated between private actions to enforce the text of &#167; 601 and private actions to enforce the regulations promulgated pursuant to &#167; 602. See &lt;i&gt;Guardians,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S., at 591 (principal opinion of White, J.) (describing this history and noting that, up to that point, no Justice had ever expressed disagreement with Justice Stewart's analysis in &lt;i&gt;Lau&lt;/i&gt; ).&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*297&lt;/span&gt; Five years later, we more explicitly considered whether a private right of action exists to enforce the guarantees of Title VI and its gender-based twin, Title IX. See &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;University of Chicago,&lt;/i&gt; 441 U. S. 677 (1979). In that case&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt;  we examined the text of the statutes, analyzed the purpose of the laws, and canvassed the relevant legislative history. Our conclusion was unequivocal: "We have no doubt that Congress intended to create Title IX remedies comparable to those available under Title VI and that it understood Title VI as authorizing an implied private cause of action for victims of the prohibited discrimination." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 703.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority acknowledges that &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; is binding precedent with regard to both Title VI and Title IX, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 279-280, but seeks to limit the scope of its holding to cases involving allegations of intentional discrimination. The distinction the majority attempts to impose is wholly foreign to &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; `s text and reasoning. The opinion in &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt;  consistently treats the question presented in that case as whether a private right of action exists to enforce "Title IX" (and by extension "Title VI"),&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; and does not draw any distinctions between the various types of discrimination outlawed by the operation of those statutes. Though the opinion did not reach out to affirmatively preclude the drawing of every conceivable distinction, it could hardly have been more clear as to the scope of its holding: A private right of action exists for "victims of &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; prohibited discrimination." 441 U. S., at 703 (emphasis added). Not some of the prohibited discrimination, but all of it.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*298&lt;/span&gt; Moreover, &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; was itself a disparate-impact case. In that case, the plaintiff brought suit against two private universities challenging medical school admissions policies that set age limits for applicants. Plaintiff, a 39-year-old woman, alleged that these rules had the effect of discriminating against women because the incidence of interrupted higher education is higher among women than among men. In providing a shorthand description of her claim in the text of the opinion, we ambiguously stated that she had alleged that she was denied admission "because she is a woman," but we appended a lengthy footnote setting forth the details of her disparate-impact claim. Other than the shorthand description of her claim, there is not a word in the text of the opinion even suggesting that she had made the improbable allegation that the University of Chicago and Northwestern University had intentionally discriminated against women. In the context of the entire opinion (including both its analysis and its uncontested description of the facts of the case), that single ambiguous phrase provides no basis for limiting the case's holding to incidents of intentional discrimination. If anything, the fact that the phrase "because she is a woman" encompasses both intentional and disparate-impact claims should have made it clear that the reasoning in the opinion was equally applicable to both types of claims. In any event, the &lt;i&gt;holding&lt;/i&gt; of the case certainly applied to the disparate-impact claim that was described in detail in footnote 1 of the opinion, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 680.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our fractured decision in &lt;i&gt;Guardians Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S. 582 (1983), reinforces the conclusion that this issue is effectively settled. While &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*299&lt;/span&gt; the various opinions in that case took different views as to the spectrum of relief available to plaintiffs in Title VI cases, a clear majority of the Court expressly stated that private parties may seek injunctive relief against governmental practices that have the effect of discriminating against racial and ethnic minorities. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 594-595, 607 (White, J.); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 634 (Marshall, J., dissenting); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 638 (Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting). As this case involves just such an action, its result ought to follow naturally from &lt;i&gt;Guardians.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read today's opinion, the majority declines to accord precedential value to &lt;i&gt;Guardians&lt;/i&gt; because the five Justices in the majority were arguably divided over the mechanism through which private parties might seek such injunctive relief.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; This argument inspires two responses. First, to the extent that the majority denies relief to the respondents merely because they neglected to mention 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1983 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*300&lt;/span&gt; in framing their Title VI claim, this case is something of a sport. Litigants who in the future wish to enforce the Title VI regulations against state actors in all likelihood must only reference &#167; 1983 to obtain relief; indeed, the plaintiffs in this case (or other similarly situated individuals) presumably retain the option of rechallenging Alabama's English-only policy in a complaint that invokes &#167; 1983 even after today's decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the majority's reading of &lt;i&gt;Guardians&lt;/i&gt; is strained even in reference to the broader question whether injunctive relief is available to remedy violations of the Title VI regulations by nongovernmental grantees. As &lt;i&gt;Guardians&lt;/i&gt; involved an action against a governmental entity, making &#167; 1983 relief available, the Court might have discussed the availability of judicial relief without addressing the scope of the implied private right of action available directly under Title VI. See 463 U. S., at 638 (Stevens, J.) ("Even if it were not settled by now that Title VI authorizes appropriate relief, both prospective and retroactive, to victims of racial discrimination at the hands of recipients of federal funds, the same result would follow in this case because the petitioners have sought relief under 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1983" (emphasis deleted)). However, the analysis in each of the relevant opinions did not do so.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; Rather than focusing on considerations &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*301&lt;/span&gt; specific to &#167; 1983, each of these opinions looked instead to our opinion in &lt;i&gt;Cannon,&lt;/i&gt; to the intent of the Congress that adopted Title VI and the contemporaneous executive decisionmakers who crafted the disparate-impact regulations, and to general principles of remediation.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, there is clear precedent of this Court for the proposition that the plaintiffs in this case can seek injunctive relief either through an implied right of action or through &#167; 1983. Though the holding in &lt;i&gt;Guardians&lt;/i&gt; does not compel the conclusion that a private right of action exists to enforce the Title VI regulations against private parties, the rationales of the relevant opinions strongly imply that result. When that fact is coupled with our holding in &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; and our unanimous decision in &lt;i&gt;Lau,&lt;/i&gt; the answer to the question presented in this case is overdetermined.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; Even absent my &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*302&lt;/span&gt; continued belief that Congress intended a private right of action to enforce both Title VI and its implementing regulations, I would answer the question presented in the affirmative and affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals as a matter of &lt;i&gt;stare decisis.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*303&lt;/span&gt; II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underlying the majority's dismissive treatment of our prior cases is a flawed understanding of the structure of Title VI and, more particularly, of the relationship between &#167;&#167; 601 and 602. To some extent, confusion as to the relationship between the provisions is understandable, as Title VI is a deceptively simple statute. Section 601 of the Act lays out its straightforward commitment: "No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000d. Section 602 "authorize[s] and direct[s]" all federal departments and agencies empowered to extend federal financial assistance to issue "rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability" in order to "effectuate" &#167; 601's antidiscrimination mandate. 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000d&#151;1.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, the relationship between &#167;&#167; 601 and 602 is unproblematic&#151;&#167; 601 states a basic principle, &#167; 602 authorizes agencies to develop detailed plans for defining the contours of the principle and ensuring its enforcement. In the context of federal civil rights law, however, nothing is ever so simple. As actions to enforce &#167; 601's antidiscrimination principle have worked their way through the courts, we have developed a body of law giving content to &#167; 601's broadly worded commitment. &lt;i&gt;E. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fordice,&lt;/i&gt; 505 U. S. 717, 732, n. 7 (1992); &lt;i&gt;Guardians Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Civil Serv.&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*304&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Comm'n of New York City,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S. 582 (1983); &lt;i&gt;Regents of Univ. of Cal.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bakke,&lt;/i&gt; 438 U. S. 265 (1978). As the majority emphasizes today, the Judiciary's understanding of what conduct may be remedied in actions brought directly under &#167; 601 is, in certain ways, more circumscribed than the conduct prohibited by the regulations. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 280-281.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that seeming peculiarity, it is necessary to examine closely the relationship between &#167;&#167; 601 and 602, in order to understand the purpose and import of the regulations at issue in this case. For the most part, however, the majority ignores this task, assuming that the judicial decisions interpreting &#167; 601 provide an authoritative interpretation of its true meaning and treating the regulations promulgated by the agencies charged with administering the statute as poor stepcousins&#151;either parroting the text of &#167; 601 (in the case of regulations that prohibit intentional discrimination) or forwarding an agenda untethered to &#167; 601's mandate (in the case of disparate-impact regulations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority's statutory analysis does violence to both the text and the structure of Title VI. Section 601 does not stand in isolation, but rather as part of an integrated remedial scheme. Section 602 exists for the sole purpose of forwarding the antidiscrimination ideals laid out in &#167; 601.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; The majority's persistent belief that the two sections somehow forward different agendas finds no support in the statute. Nor does Title VI anywhere suggest, let alone state, that for the purpose of determining their legal effect, the "rules, regulations, [and] orders of general applicability" adopted by the agencies are to be bifurcated by the Judiciary into two categories based on how closely the courts believe the regulations track the text of &#167; 601.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*305&lt;/span&gt; What makes the Court's analysis even more troubling is that our cases have already adopted a simpler and more sensible model for understanding the relationship between the two sections. For three decades, we have treated &#167; 602 as granting the responsible agencies the power to issue broad prophylactic rules aimed at realizing the vision laid out in &#167; 601, even if the conduct captured by these rules is at times broader than that which would otherwise be prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Lau,&lt;/i&gt; our first Title VI case, the only three Justices whose understanding of &#167; 601 required them to reach the question explicitly endorsed the power of the agencies to adopt broad prophylactic rules to enforce the aims of the statute. As Justice Stewart explained, regulations promulgated pursuant to &#167; 602 may "go beyond . . . &#167; 601" as long as they are "reasonably related" to its antidiscrimination mandate. 414 U. S., at 571 (Stewart, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Blackmun, J., concurring in result). In &lt;i&gt;Guardians,&lt;/i&gt; at least three Members of the Court adopted a similar understanding of the statute. See 463 U. S., at 643 (Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting). Finally, just 16 years ago, our unanimous opinion in &lt;i&gt;Alexander&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Choate,&lt;/i&gt; 469 U. S. 287 (1985), treated this understanding of Title VI's structure as settled law. Writing for the Court, Justice Marshall aptly explained the interpretation of &#167; 602's grant of regulatory power that necessarily underlies our prior case law: "In essence, then, we [have] held that Title VI [has] delegated to the agencies in the first instance the complex determination of what sorts of disparate impacts upon minorities constituted sufficiently significant social problems, and [are] readily enough remediable, to warrant altering the practices of the federal grantees that [have] produced those impacts." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 293-294.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This understanding is firmly rooted in the text of Title VI. As &#167; 602 explicitly states, the agencies are authorized to adopt regulations to "effectuate" &#167; 601's antidiscrimination mandate. 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000d&#151;1. The plain meaning of the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*306&lt;/span&gt; text reveals Congress' intent to provide the relevant agencies with sufficient authority to transform the statute's broad aspiration into social reality. So too does a lengthy, consistent, and impassioned legislative history.&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This legislative design reflects a reasonable&#151;indeed inspired&#151;model for attacking the often-intractable problem of racial and ethnic discrimination. On its own terms, the statute supports an action challenging policies of federal grantees that explicitly or unambiguously violate antidiscrimination norms (such as policies that on their face limit benefits or services to certain races). With regard to more subtle forms of discrimination (such as schemes that limit benefits or services on ostensibly race-neutral grounds but have the predictable and perhaps intended consequence of materially benefiting some races at the expense of others), the statute does not establish a static approach but instead empowers the relevant agencies to evaluate social circumstances to determine whether there is a need for stronger measures.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*307&lt;/span&gt; Such an approach builds into the law flexibility, an ability to make nuanced assessments of complex social realities, and an admirable willingness to credit the possibility of progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "effects" regulations at issue in this case represent the considered judgment of the relevant agencies that discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, and national origin by federal contractees are significant social problems that might be remedied, or at least ameliorated, by the application of a broad prophylactic rule. Given the judgment underlying them, the regulations are inspired by, at the service of, and inseparably intertwined with &#167; 601's antidiscrimination mandate. Contrary to the majority's suggestion, they "appl[y]" &#167; 601's prohibition on discrimination just as surely as the intentional discrimination regulations the majority concedes are privately enforceable. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 284.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the extent that our prior cases mischaracterize the relationship between &#167;&#167; 601 and 602, they err on the side of underestimating, not overestimating, the connection between the two provisions. While our cases have explicitly adopted an understanding of &#167; 601's scope that is somewhat narrower than the reach of the regulations,&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; they have done so in an unorthodox and somewhat haphazard fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our conclusion that the legislation only encompasses intentional discrimination was never the subject of thorough consideration by a Court focused on that question. In &lt;i&gt;Bakke,&lt;/i&gt;  five Members of this Court concluded that &#167; 601 only prohibits race-based affirmative-action programs in situations where the Equal Protection Clause would impose a similar ban. 438 U. S., at 287 (principal opinion of Powell, J.); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*308&lt;/span&gt; 325, 328, 352 (Brennan, J., joined by White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Guardians,&lt;/i&gt; the majority of the Court held that the analysis of those five Justices in &lt;i&gt;Bakke&lt;/i&gt; compelled &lt;i&gt;as a matter of stare decisis&lt;/i&gt; the conclusion that &#167; 601 does not on its own terms reach disparate-impact cases. 463 U. S., at 610-611 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment); &lt;i&gt;id.&lt;/i&gt; , at 612 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 642 (Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting). However, the opinions adopting that conclusion did not engage in any independent analysis of the reach of &#167; 601. Indeed, the only writing on this subject came from two of the five Members of the &lt;i&gt;Bakke&lt;/i&gt; "majority," each of whom wrote separately to reject the remaining Justices' understanding of their opinions in &lt;i&gt;Bakke&lt;/i&gt; and to insist that &#167; 601 does in fact reach some instances of unintentional discrimination. 463 U. S., at 589-590 (White, J.); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 623-624 (Marshall, J., dissenting).&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt; The Court's occasional rote invocation of this &lt;i&gt;Guardians&lt;/i&gt; majority in later cases ought not obscure the fact that the question whether &#167; 601 applies to disparate-impact claims has never been analyzed by this Court on the merits.&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*309&lt;/span&gt; In addition, these Title VI cases seemingly ignore the well-established principle of administrative law that is now most often described as the "&lt;i&gt;Chevron&lt;/i&gt; doctrine." See &lt;i&gt;Chevron U. S. A. Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt;  467 U. S. 837 (1984). In most other contexts, when the agencies charged with administering a broadly worded statute offer regulations interpreting that statute or giving concrete guidance as to its implementation, we treat their interpretation of the statute's breadth as controlling unless it presents an unreasonable construction of the statutory text. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; While there may be some dispute as to the boundaries of &lt;i&gt;Chevron&lt;/i&gt; deference, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Christensen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Harris County,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S. 576 (2000), it is paradigmatically appropriate when Congress has clearly delegated agencies the power to issue regulations with the force of law and established formal procedures for the promulgation of such regulations.&lt;sup&gt;[18]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were writing on ablank slate, we might very well conclude that &lt;i&gt;Chevron&lt;/i&gt; and similar cases decided both before and after &lt;i&gt;Guardians&lt;/i&gt; provide the proper framework for understanding the structure of Title VI. Under such a reading there would be no incongruity between &#167;&#167; 601 and 602. Instead, we would read &#167; 602 as granting the federal agencies responsible for distributing federal funds the authority &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*310&lt;/span&gt; to issue regulations interpreting &#167; 601 on the assumption that their construction will&#151;if reasonable&#151;be incorporated into our understanding of &#167; 601's meaning.&lt;sup&gt;[19]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resolve this case, however, it is unnecessary to answer the question whether our cases interpreting the reach of &#167; 601 should be reinterpreted in light of &lt;i&gt;Chevron.&lt;/i&gt; If one understands the relationship between &#167;&#167; 601 and 602 through the prism of &lt;i&gt;either Chevron&lt;/i&gt; or our prior Title VI cases, the question presented all but answers itself. If the regulations promulgated pursuant to &#167; 602 are either an authoritative construction of &#167; 601's meaning or prophylactic rules necessary to actualize the goals enunciated in &#167; 601, then it makes no sense to differentiate between private actions to enforce &#167; 601 and private actions to enforce &#167; 602. There is but one private action to enforce Title VI, and we already know that such an action exists.&lt;sup&gt;[20]&lt;/sup&gt; See &lt;i&gt;Cannon,&lt;/i&gt; 441 U. S., at 703.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*311&lt;/span&gt; III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority couples its flawed analysis of the structure of Title VI with an uncharitable understanding of the substance of the divide between those on this Court who are reluctant to interpret statutes to allow for private rights of action and those who are willing to do so if the claim of right survives a rigorous application of the criteria set forth in &lt;i&gt;Cort&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ash,&lt;/i&gt; 422 U. S. 66 (1975). As the majority narrates our implied right of action jurisprudence, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 286-287, the Court's shift to a more skeptical approach represents the rejection of a common-law judicial activism in favor of a principled recognition of the limited role of a contemporary "federal tribuna[l]." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 287. According to its analysis, the recognition of an implied right of action when the text and structure of the statute do not absolutely compel such a conclusion is an act of judicial self-indulgence. As much as we would like to help those disadvantaged by discrimination, we must resist the temptation to pour ourselves "one last drink." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; To do otherwise would be to "ventur[e] beyond Congress's intent." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overwrought imagery aside, it is the majority's approach that blinds itself to congressional intent. While it remains true that, if Congress intends a private right of action to support statutory rights, "the far better course is for it to specify as much when it creates those rights," &lt;i&gt;Cannon,&lt;/i&gt; 441 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*312&lt;/span&gt; U. S., at 717, its failure to do so does not absolve us of the responsibility to endeavor to discern its intent. In a series of cases since &lt;i&gt;Cort&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ash&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; we have laid out rules and developed strategies for this task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very existence of these rules and strategies assumes that we will sometimes find manifestations of an implicit intent to create such a right. Our decision in &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; represents one such occasion. As the &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; opinion iterated and reiterated, the question whether the plaintiff had a right of action that could be asserted in federal court was a "question of statutory construction," 441 U. S., at 688; see also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 717 (Rehnquist, J., concurring), not a question of policy for the Court to decide. Applying the &lt;i&gt;Cort&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ash&lt;/i&gt; factors, we examined the nature of the rights at issue, the text and structure of the statute, and the relevant legislative history.&lt;sup&gt;[21]&lt;/sup&gt; Our conclusion was that Congress unmistakably intended a private right of action to enforce both Title IX and Title VI. Our reasoning&#151;and, as I have demonstrated, our holding&#151;was equally applicable to intentional discrimination and disparate-impact claims.&lt;sup&gt;[22]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underlying today's opinion is the conviction that &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt;  must be cabined because it exemplifies an "expansive rightscreating &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*313&lt;/span&gt; approach." &lt;i&gt;Franklin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gwinnett County Public Schools,&lt;/i&gt; 503 U. S. 60, 77 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). But, as I have taken pains to explain, it was Congress, not the Court, that created the cause of action, and it was the Congress that later ratified the &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; holding in 1986 and again in 1988. See 503 U. S., at 72-73.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to impose its own preferences as to the availability of judicial remedies, the Court today adopts a methodology that blinds itself to important evidence of congressional intent. It is one thing for the Court to ignore the import of our holding in &lt;i&gt;Cannon,&lt;/i&gt; as the breadth of that precedent is a matter upon which reasonable jurists may differ. It is entirely another thing for the majority to ignore the reasoning of that opinion and the evidence contained therein, as those arguments and that evidence speak directly to the question at issue today. As I stated above, see n. 21, &lt;i&gt;supra, Cannon&lt;/i&gt;  carefully explained that both Title VI and Title IX were intended to benefit a particular class of individuals, that the purposes of the statutes would be furthered rather than frustrated by the implication of a private right of action, and that the legislative histories of the statutes support the conclusion that Congress intended such a right. See also Part IV, &lt;i&gt;infra.&lt;/i&gt; Those conclusions and the evidence supporting them continue to have force today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if the majority is genuinely committed to deciphering congressional intent, its unwillingness to even consider evidence as to the context in which Congress legislated is perplexing. Congress does not legislate in a vacuum. As the respondents and the Government suggest, and as we have held several times, the objective manifestations of congressional intent to create a private right of action must be measured in light of the enacting Congress' expectations as to how the judiciary might evaluate the question. See &lt;i&gt;Thompson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Thompson,&lt;/i&gt; 484 U. S. 174 (1988); &lt;i&gt;Merrill Lynch,&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*314&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Pierce, Fenner &amp;amp; Smith, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Curran,&lt;/i&gt; 456 U. S. 353, 378&#151; 379 (1982); &lt;i&gt;Cannon,&lt;/i&gt; 441 U. S., at 698-699.&lt;sup&gt;[23]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time Congress was considering Title VI, it was normal practice for the courts to infer that Congress intended a private right of action whenever it passed a statute designed to protect a particular class that did not contain enforcement mechanisms which would be thwarted by a private remedy. See &lt;i&gt;Merrill Lynch,&lt;/i&gt; 456 U. S., at 374-375 (discussing this history). Indeed, the very year Congress adopted Title VI, this Court specifically stated that "it is the duty of the courts to be alert to provide such remedies as are necessary to make effective the congressional purpose." &lt;i&gt;J. I. Case Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Borak,&lt;/i&gt; 377 U. S. 426, 433 (1964). Assuming, as we must, that Congress was fully informed as to the state of the law, the contemporary context presents important evidence as to Congress' intent&#151;evidence the majority declines to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, respect for Congress' prerogatives is measured in deeds, not words. Today, the Court coins a new rule, holding that a private cause of action to enforce a statute does not encompass a substantive regulation issued to effectuate that statute unless the regulation does nothing more than "authoritatively construe the statute itself." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 284.&lt;sup&gt;[24]&lt;/sup&gt; This rule might be proper if we were the kind of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*315&lt;/span&gt; "common-law court" the majority decries, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 287, inventing private rights of action never intended by Congress. For if we are not construing a statute, we certainly may refuse to create a remedy for violations of federal regulations. But if we are faithful to the commitment to discerning congressional intent that all Members of this Court profess, the distinction is untenable. There is simply no reason to assume that Congress contemplated, desired, or adopted a distinction between regulations that merely parrot statutory text and broader regulations that are authorized by statutory text.&lt;sup&gt;[25]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond its flawed structural analysis of Title VI and an evident antipathy toward implied rights of action, the majority offers little affirmative support for its conclusion that Congress did not intend to create a private remedy for violations of the Title VI regulations.&lt;sup&gt;[26]&lt;/sup&gt; The Court offers essentially &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*316&lt;/span&gt; two reasons for its position. First, it attaches significance to the fact that the "rights-creating" language in &#167; 601 that defines the classes protected by the statute is not repeated in &#167; 602. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 288-289. But, of course, there was no reason to put that language in &#167; 602 because it is perfectly obvious that the regulations authorized by &#167; 602 must be designed to protect precisely the same people protected by &#167; 601. Moreover, it is self-evident that, linguistic niceties notwithstanding, any statutory provision whose stated purpose is to "effectuate" the eradication of racial and ethnic discrimination has as its "focus" those individuals who, absent such legislation, would be subject to discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the Court repeats the argument advanced and rejected in &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; that the express provision of a fund cutoff remedy "suggests that Congress intended to preclude others." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 290. In &lt;i&gt;Cannon,&lt;/i&gt; 441 U. S., at 704-708, we carefully explained why the presence of an explicit mechanism to achieve one of the statute's objectives (ensuring that federal funds are not used "to support discriminatory practices") does not preclude a conclusion that a private right of action was intended to achieve the statute's other principal objective ("to provide individual citizens effective protection against those practices"). In support of our analysis, we offered policy arguments, cited evidence from the legislative history, and noted the active support of the relevant agencies. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; In today's decision, the Court does not grapple &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*317&lt;/span&gt; with&#151;indeed, barely acknowledges&#151;our rejection of this argument in &lt;i&gt;Cannon.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like much else in its opinion, the present majority's unwillingness to explain its refusal to find the reasoning in &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; persuasive suggests that today's decision is the unconscious product of the majority's profound distaste for implied causes of action rather than an attempt to discern the intent of the Congress that enacted Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Its colorful disclaimer of any interest in "venturing beyond Congress's intent," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 287, has a hollow ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;V&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question the Court answers today was only an open question in the most technical sense. Given the prevailing consensus in the Courts of Appeals, the Court should have declined to take this case. Having granted certiorari, the Court should have answered the question differently by simply according respect to our prior decisions. But most importantly, even if it were to ignore all of our post-1964 writing, the Court should have answered the question differently on the merits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1]  Since the parties do not dispute this point, it is puzzling to see Justice Stevens go out of his way to disparage the decisions in &lt;i&gt;Regents of Univ. of Cal.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bakke,&lt;/i&gt; 438 U. S. 265 (1978), and &lt;i&gt;Guardians Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S. 582 (1983), as "somewhat haphazard," &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 307 (dissenting opinion), particularly since he had already accorded &lt;i&gt;stare decisis&lt;/i&gt; effect to the former 18 years ago, see &lt;i&gt;Guardians,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S., at 639-642 (dissenting opinion), and since he participated in creating the latter, see &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Nor does Justice Stevens's reliance on &lt;i&gt;Chevron U. S. A. Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 837 (1984), see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 309-310, explain his about-face, since he expressly reaffirms, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 309, n. 18, the settled principle that decisions of this Court declaring the meaning of statutes prior to &lt;i&gt;Chevron&lt;/i&gt; need not be reconsidered after &lt;i&gt;Chevron&lt;/i&gt; in light of agency regulations that were already in force when our decisions were issued, &lt;i&gt;Lechmere, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;NLRB,&lt;/i&gt;  502 U. S. 527, 536-537 (1992); &lt;i&gt;Maislin Industries, U. S., Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Primary Steel, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 497 U. S. 116, 131 (1990); see also &lt;i&gt;Sullivan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Everhart,&lt;/i&gt; 494 U. S. 83, 103-104, n. 6 (1990) (Stevens, J., dissenting) ("It is, of course, of no importance that [an opinion] predates &lt;i&gt;Chevron&lt;/i&gt; . . . . As we made clear in &lt;i&gt;Chevron,&lt;/i&gt; the interpretive maxims summarized therein were `wellsettled principles' ").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Although the dissent acknowledges that "the breadth of [&lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; `s] precedent is a matter upon which reasonable jurists may differ," &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 313, it disagrees with our reading of &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; `s holding because it thinks the distinction we draw between disparate-impact and intentional discrimination was "wholly foreign" to that opinion, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 297. &lt;i&gt;Cannon,&lt;/i&gt;  however, was decided less than one year after the Court in &lt;i&gt;Bakke&lt;/i&gt; had drawn precisely that distinction &lt;i&gt;with respect to Title VI,&lt;/i&gt; see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 280-281, and it is absurd to think that &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; meant, without discussion, to ban under Title IX the very disparate-impact discrimination that &lt;i&gt;Bakke&lt;/i&gt;  said Title VI permitted. The &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; discussion in &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; of Title IX's scope is found in Justice Powell's dissenting opinion, which simply assumed that the conclusion that Title IX would be limited to intentional discrimination was "forgone in light of our holding" in &lt;i&gt;Bakke. Cannon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;University of Chicago,&lt;/i&gt; 441 U. S.677, 748, n. 19 (1979). The dissent's additional claim that &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; provided a private right of action for "all the discrimination prohibited by the &lt;i&gt;regulatory scheme&lt;/i&gt; contained in Title IX," &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt;  at 297-298, n. 4 (emphasis added), simply begs the question at the heart of this case, which is whether a right of action to enforce disparate-impact regulations must be independently identified, see &lt;i&gt;infra,&lt;/i&gt; at 284-286.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  We of course accept the statement by the author of the dissent that he "thought" at the time of &lt;i&gt;Guardians&lt;/i&gt; that disparate-impact regulations could be enforced "in an implied action against private parties," &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 301, n. 6. But we have the better interpretation of what our colleague &lt;i&gt;wrote&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Guardians.&lt;/i&gt; In the closing section of his opinion, Justice Stevens concluded that because respondents in that case had "violated the petitioners' rights under [the] regulations . . . [t]he petitioners were therefore entitled to the compensation they sought under 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1983 and were awarded by the District Court." 463 U. S., at 645. The passage omits any mention of a direct private right of action to enforce the regulations, and the footnote we have quoted in text&#151;which appears immediately after this concluding sentence, see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 645, n. 18&#151;makes clear that the omission was not accidental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Ultimately, the dissent agrees that "the holding in &lt;i&gt;Guardians&lt;/i&gt; does not compel the conclusion that a private right of action exists to enforce the Title VI regulations against private parties . . . ."&lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 301.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  It is true, as the dissent points out, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 296, that three Justices who concurred in the result in &lt;i&gt;Lau&lt;/i&gt; relied on regulations promulgated under &#167; 602 to support their position, see 414 U. S., at 570-571 (Stewart, J., concurring in result). But the five Justices who made up the majority did not, and their holding is not made coextensive with the concurrence because their opinion does not expressly preclude (is "consistent with," see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 296) the concurrence's approach. The Court would be in an odd predicament if a concurring minority of the Justices could force the majority to address a point they found it unnecessary (and did not wish) to address, under compulsion of Justice Stevens's new principle that silence implies agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  For this reason, the dissent's extended discussion of the scope of agencies' regulatory authority under &#167; 602, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 305-307, is beside the point. We cannot help observing, however, how strange it is to say that disparate-impact regulations are "inspired by, at the service of, and inseparably intertwined with" &#167; 601, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 307, when &#167; 601 permits the very behavior that the regulations forbid. See &lt;i&gt;Guardians,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S., at 613 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) ("If, as five Members of the Court concluded in &lt;i&gt;Bakke,&lt;/i&gt; the purpose of Title VI is to proscribe &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt;  purposeful discrimination . . . , regulations that would proscribe conduct by the recipient having only a discriminatory &lt;i&gt;effect&lt;/i&gt; . . . do not simply `further' the purpose of Title VI; they go well &lt;i&gt;beyond&lt;/i&gt; that purpose").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  Although the dissent claims that we "adop[t] a methodology that blinds itself to important evidence of congressional intent," see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 313, our methodology is not novel, but well established in earlier decisions (including one authored by Justice Stevens, see &lt;i&gt;Northwest Airlines, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Transport Workers,&lt;/i&gt; 451 U. S. 77, 94, n. 31 (1981)), which explain that the interpretive inquiry begins with the text and structure of the statute, see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 91, and ends once it has become clear that Congress did not provide a cause of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  The dissent complains that we "offe[r] little affirmative support" for this conclusion. &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 315. But as Justice Stevens has previously recognized in an opinion for the Court, "affirmative" evidence of congressional intent must be provided &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; an implied remedy, not against it, for without such intent "the essential predicate for implication of a private remedy simply does not exist," &lt;i&gt;Northwest Airlines, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 451 U. S., at 94. The dissent's assertion that "respondents &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; marshaled substantial affirmative evidence that a private right of action exists to enforce Title VI &lt;i&gt;and the regulations validly promulgated thereunder," post,&lt;/i&gt; at 316, n. 26 (second emphasis added), once again begs the question whether authorization of a private right of action to enforce a statute constitutes authorization of a private right of action to enforce regulations that go beyond what the statute itself requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Just about every Court of Appeals has either explicitly or implicitly held that a private right of action exists to enforce all of the regulations issued pursuant to Title VI, including the disparate-impact regulations. For decisions holding so most explicitly, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Powell&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ridge,&lt;/i&gt; 189 F. 3d 387, 400 (CA3 1999); &lt;i&gt;Chester Residents Concerned for Quality Living&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Seif,&lt;/i&gt; 132 F. 3d 925, 936-937 (CA3 1997), summarily vacated and remanded, 524 U. S. 974 (1998); &lt;i&gt;David K.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lane,&lt;/i&gt; 839 F. 2d 1265, 1274 (CA7 1988); &lt;i&gt;Sandoval&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hagan,&lt;/i&gt; 197 F. 3d 484 (CA11 1999) (case below). See also &lt;i&gt;Latinos Unidos De Chelsea&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,&lt;/i&gt; 799 F. 2d 774, 785, n. 20 (CA1 1986); &lt;i&gt;New York Urban League, Inc.&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;New York,&lt;/i&gt; 71 F. 3d 1031, 1036 (CA2 1995); &lt;i&gt;Ferguson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Charleston,&lt;/i&gt; 186 F. 3d 469 (CA4 1999), rev'd on other grounds, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 67; &lt;i&gt;Castaneda&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Pickard,&lt;/i&gt; 781 F. 2d 456, 465, n. 11 (CA5 1986); &lt;i&gt;Buchanan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bolivar,&lt;/i&gt; 99 F. 3d 1352, 1356, n. 5 (CA6 1996); &lt;i&gt;Larry P.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Riles,&lt;/i&gt; 793 F. 2d 969, 981-982 (CA9 1986); &lt;i&gt;Villanueva&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Carere,&lt;/i&gt; 85 F. 3d 481, 486 (CA10 1996). No Court of Appeals has ever reached a contrary conclusion. But cf. &lt;i&gt;New York City Environmental Justice Alliance&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Giuliani,&lt;/i&gt; 214 F. 3d 65, 72 (CA2 2000) (suggesting that the question may be open).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Indeed, it would have been remarkable if the majority had offered any disagreement with the concurring analysis as the concurring Justices grounded their argument in well-established principles for determining the availability of remedies under regulations, principles that all but one Member of the Court had endorsed the previous Term. See &lt;i&gt;Mourning&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Family Publications Service, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 411 U. S. 356, 369 (1973); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 378 (Douglas, J., joined by Stewart and Rehnquist, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (agreeing with the majority's analysis of the regulation in question); but see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 383, n. 1 (Powell, J., dissenting) (reserving analysis of the regulation's validity). The other decision the concurring Justices cited for this well-established principle was unanimous and only five years old. See &lt;i&gt;Thorpe&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Housing Authority of Durham,&lt;/i&gt; 393 U. S. 268 (1969).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  See &lt;i&gt;Cannon,&lt;/i&gt; 441 U. S., at 687, 699, 702, n. 33, 703, 706, n. 40, 709.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  The majority is undoubtedly correct that &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; was not a case about the substance of Title IX but rather about the remedies available under that statute. Therefore, &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; cannot stand as a precedent for the proposition either that Title IX and its implementing regulations reach intentional discrimination or that they do not do so. What &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; did hold is that all the discrimination prohibited by the regulatory scheme contained in Title IX may be the subject of a private lawsuit. As the Court today concedes that &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; `s holding applies to Title VI claims as well as Title IX claims, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 279-280, and assumes that the regulations promulgated pursuant to &#167; 602 are validly promulgated anti discrimination measures, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 281-282, it is clear that today's opinion is in substantial tension with &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; `s reasoning and holding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  None of the relevant opinions was absolutely clear as to whether it envisioned such suits as being brought directly under the statute or under 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1983. However, a close reading of the opinions leaves little doubt that all of the Justices making up the &lt;i&gt;Guardians&lt;/i&gt; majority contemplated the availability of private actions brought directly under the statute. Justice White fairly explicitly rested his conclusion on &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; `s holding that an implied right of action exists to enforce the terms of both Title VI and Title IX. &lt;i&gt;Guardians,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S., at 594-595. Given that fact and the added consideration that his opinion appears to have equally contemplated suits against private and public parties, it is clear that he envisioned the availability of injunctive relief directly under the statute. Justice Marshall's opinion never mentions &#167; 1983 and refers simply to "Title VI actions." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 625. In addition, his opinion can only be read as contemplating suits on equal terms against both public and private grantees, thus also suggesting that he assumed such suits could be brought directly under the statute. That leaves my opinion. Like Justice White, I made it quite clear that I believed the right to sue to enforce the disparate-impact regulations followed directly from &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; and, hence, was built directly into the statute. 463 U. S., at 635-636, and n. 1. However, I did also note that, in the alternative, relief would be available in that particular case under &#167; 1983.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  The Court today cites one sentence in my final footnote in &lt;i&gt;Guardians&lt;/i&gt;  that it suggests is to the contrary. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 283 (citing 463 U. S., at 645, n. 18). However, the Court misreads that sentence. In his opinion in &lt;i&gt;Guardians,&lt;/i&gt; Justice Powell had stated that he would affirm the judgment for the reasons stated in his dissent in &lt;i&gt;Cannon,&lt;/i&gt; see 463 U. S.&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; at 609-610 (opinion concurring in judgment), and that he would also hold that private actions asserting violations of Title VI could not be brought under &#167; 1983, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 610, and n. 3. One reason that he advanced in support of these conclusions was his view that the standard of proof in a &#167; 1983 action against public officials would differ from the standard in an action against private defendants. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 608, n. 1. In a footnote at the end of my opinion, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 645, n. 18, I responded (perhaps inartfully) to Justice Powell. I noted that the fact that &#167; 1983 authorizes a lawsuit against the police department based on its violation of the governing administrative regulations did not mean, as Justice Powell had suggested, "that a similar action would be unavailable against a similarly situated private party." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; I added the sentence that the Court quotes today, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 283, not to reserve a question, but rather to explain that the record did not support Justice Powell's hypothesis regarding the standard of proof. I thought then, as I do now, that a violation of regulations adopted pursuant to Title VI may be established by proof of discriminatory impact in a &#167; 1983 action against state actors and also in an implied action against private parties. See n. 5, &lt;i&gt;supra.&lt;/i&gt; Contrary to the Court's partial quotation of my opinion, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 283-284, n. 3, what I wrote amply reflected what I thought. See 463 U. S., at 635 ("a private action against recipients of federal funds"); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 636 ("implied caus[e] of action"); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 638 ("Title VI authorizes appropriate relief").
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Powell was quite correct in noting that it would be anomalous to assume that Congress would have intended to make it easier to recover from public officials than from private parties. That anomaly, however, does not seem to trouble the majority today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  See n. 5, &lt;i&gt;supra.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  See also &lt;i&gt;Bazemore&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Friday,&lt;/i&gt; 478 U. S. 385 (1986) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; (adjudicating on the merits a claim brought under Title VI regulations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9]  The settled expectations the Court undercuts today derive not only from judicial decisions, but also from the consistent statements and actions of Congress. Congress' actions over the last two decades reflect a clear understanding of the existence of a private right of action to enforce Title VI and its implementing regulations. In addition to numerous other small-scale amendments, Congress has twice adopted legislation expanding the reach of Title VI. See Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, &#167; 6, 102 Stat. 31 (codified at 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000d&#151;4a) (expanding definition of "program"); Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, &#167; 1003, 100 Stat. 1845 (codified at 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000d&#151;7) (explicitly abrogating States' Eleventh Amendment immunity in suits under Title VI).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these bills were adopted after this Court's decisions in &lt;i&gt;Lau, Cannon,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Guardians,&lt;/i&gt; and after most of the Courts of Appeals had affirmatively acknowledged an implied private right of action to enforce the disparate-impact regulations. Their legislative histories explicitly reflect the fact that both proponents and opponents of the bills assumed that the full breadth of Title VI (including the disparate-impact regulations promulgated pursuant to it) would be enforceable in private actions. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Civil Rights Act of 1984: Hearings on S. 2658 before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., 530 (1984) (memo from the Office of Management and Budget objecting to the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 because it would bring more entities within the scope of Title VI, thereby subjecting them to "private lawsuits" to enforce the disparate-impact regulations); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 532 (same memo warning of a proliferation of "discriminatory effects" suits by "members of the bar" acting as "private Attorneys General"); 134 Cong. Rec. 4257 (1988) (statement of Sen. Hatch) (arguing that the disparate-impact regulations go too far and noting that that is a particular problem because, "[o]f course, advocacy groups will be able to bring private lawsuits making the same allegations before federal judges"); see also Brief for United States 24, n. 16 (collecting testimony of academics advising Congress that private lawsuits were available to enforce the disparate-impact regulations under existing precedent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, this case goes well beyond the normal situation in which, "after a comprehensive reexamination and significant amendment," Congress "left intact the statutory provisions under which the federal courts had implied a private cause of action." &lt;i&gt;Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp;amp; Smith, Inc.&lt;/i&gt;  v.&lt;i&gt;Curran,&lt;/i&gt; 456 U. S. 353, 381-382 (1982). Here, there is no need to rest on presumptions of knowledge and ratification, because the direct evidence of Congress' understanding is plentiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[10]  The remainder of Title VI provides for judicial and administrative review of agency actions taken pursuant to the statute, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000d&#151;2; imposes certain limitations not at issue in this case, &#167;&#167; 2000d&#151;3 to 2000d&#151;4; and defines some of the terms found in the other provisions of the statute, &#167; 2000d&#151;4a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[11]  See 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000d&#151;1 (&#167; 602) ("Each Federal department and agency which is empowered to extend Federal financial assistance . . . is authorized and directed to effectuate the provisions of [&#167; 601] . . . by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[12]  See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 110 Cong. Rec. 6543 (1964) (statement of Sen. Humphrey) ("Simple justice requires that public funds, to which all taxpayers of all races contribute, not be spent in any fashion which encourages, entrenches, subsidizes, or results in racial discrimination"); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1520 (statement of Rep. Celler) (describing &#167; 602 as requiring federal agencies to "reexamine" their programs "to make sure that adequate action has been taken to preclude . . . discrimination").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[13]  It is important, in this context, to note that regulations prohibiting policies that have a disparate impact are not necessarily aimed only&#151; or even primarily&#151;at unintentional discrimination. Many policies whose very intent is to discriminate are framed in a race-neutral manner. It is often difficult to obtain direct evidence of this motivating animus. Therefore, an agency decision to adopt disparate-impact regulations may very well reflect a determination by that agency that substantial intentional discrimination pervades the industry it is charged with regulating but that such discrimination is difficult to prove directly. As I have stated before: "Frequently the most probative evidence of intent will be objective evidence of what actually happened rather than evidence describing the subjective state of mind of the actor." &lt;i&gt;Washington&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Davis,&lt;/i&gt;  426 U. S. 229, 253 (1976) (concurring opinion). On this reading, Title VI simply accords the agencies the power to decide whether or not to credit such evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[14]  See,&lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alexander&lt;/i&gt; v.&lt;i&gt;Choate,&lt;/i&gt; 469 U. S. 287,293 (1985) (stating,in dicta,"Title VI itself directly reach[es] only instances of intentional discrimination"); &lt;i&gt;Guardians Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City,&lt;/i&gt;  463 U. S. 582 (1983) (in separate opinions, seven Justices indicate that &#167; 601 on its face bars only intentional discrimination).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[15]  Of course, those five Justices divided over the application of the Equal Protection Clause&#151;and by extension Title VI&#151;to affirmative action cases. Therefore, it is somewhat strange to treat the opinions of those five Justices in &lt;i&gt;Bakke&lt;/i&gt; as constituting a majority for any particular substantive interpretation of Title VI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[16]  The fact that Justices Marshall and White both felt that the opinion they coauthored in &lt;i&gt;Bakke&lt;/i&gt; did not resolve the question whether Title VI on its face reaches disparate-impact claims belies the majority's assertion that &lt;i&gt;Bakke&lt;/i&gt; "had drawn precisely that distinction," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 283, n. 2, much less its implication that it would have been "absurd" to think otherwise, &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[17]  In this context, it is worth noting that in a variety of other settings the Court has interpreted similarly ambiguous civil rights provisions to prohibit some policies based on their disparate impact on a protected group. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Griggs&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Duke Power Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 401 U. S. 424, 432 (1971) (Title VII); &lt;i&gt;City of Rome&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 446 U. S. 156, 172-173 (1980) (&#167; 5 of the Voting Rights Act); cf. &lt;i&gt;Alexander&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Choate,&lt;/i&gt; 469 U. S., at 292-296 (explaining why the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which was modeled after &#167; 601, might be considered to reach some instances of disparate impact and then assuming that it does for purposes of deciding the case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[18]  In relying on the &lt;i&gt;Chevron&lt;/i&gt; doctrine,I do not mean to suggest that our decision in&lt;i&gt;Chevron&lt;/i&gt; stated a new rule that requires the wholesale reconsideration of our statutory interpretation precedents. Instead, I continue to adhere to my position in &lt;i&gt;Sullivan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Everhart,&lt;/i&gt; 494 U. S. 83, 103-104, n. 6 (1990) (stating that &lt;i&gt;Chevron&lt;/i&gt; merely summarized "wellsettled principles").In suggesting that,with regard to Title VI, we might reconsider whether our prior decisions gave sufficient deference to the agencies' interpretation of the statute,I do no more than question whether in this particular instance we paid sufficient consideration to those "well-settled principles."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[19]  The legislative history strongly indicates that the Congress that adopted Title VI and the administration that proposed the statute intended that the agencies and departments would utilize the authority granted under &#167; 602 to shape the substantive contours of &#167; 601. For example, during the hearings that preceded the passage of the statute, Attorney General Kennedy agreed that the administrators of the various agencies would have the power to define "what constitutes discrimination" under Title VI and "what acts or omissions are to be forbidden." Civil Rights&#151;The President's Program, 1963: Hearings before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 399-400 (1963); see also Civil Rights: Hearings before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 4, p. 2740 (1963) (remarks of Attorney General Kennedy) (only after the agencies "establish the rules" will recipients "understand what they can and cannot do"). It was, in fact, concern for this broad delegation that inspired Congress to amend the pending bill to ensure that all regulations issued pursuant to Title VI would have to be approved by the President. See 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000d&#151;1 (laying out the requirement); 110 Cong. Rec. 2499 (1964) (remarks of Rep. Lindsay introducing the amendment). For further discussion of this legislative history, see &lt;i&gt;Guardians,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S., at 615-624 (Marshall, J., dissenting); Abernathy, Title VI and the Constitution: A Regulatory Model for Defining "Discrimination," 70 Geo. L. J. 1 (1981).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[20]  The majority twice suggests that I "be[g] the question" whether a private right of action to enforce Title VI necessarily encompasses a right of action to enforce the regulations validly promulgated pursuant to the statute. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 283, n. 2, 293, n. 8. As the above analysis demonstrates, I do no such thing. On the contrary, I demonstrate that the disparate-impact regulations promulgated pursuant to &#167; 602 are&#151;and have always been considered to be&#151;an important part of an integrated remedial scheme intended to promote the statute's antidiscrimination goals. Given that fact, there is simply no logical or legal justification for differentiating between actions to enforce the regulations and actions to enforce the statutory text. Furthermore, as my integrated approach reflects the longstanding practice of this Court, see n. 2, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; it is the majority's largely unexplained assumption that a private right of action to enforce the disparate-impact regulations must be independently established that "begs the question."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[21]  The text of the statute contained "an unmistakable focus on the benefited class," 441 U. S., at 691; its legislative history "rather plainly indicates that Congress intended to create such a remedy," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 694; the legislators' repeated references to private enforcement of Title VI reflected "their intent with respect to Title IX," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 696-698; and the absence of legislative action to change the prevailing view with respect to Title VI left us with "no doubt that Congress intended to create Title IX remedies comparable to those available under Title VI and that it understood Title VI as authorizing an implied private cause of action for victims of prohibited discrimination," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 703.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[22]  We should not overlook the fact that &lt;i&gt;Cannon&lt;/i&gt; was decided after the &lt;i&gt;Bakke&lt;/i&gt; majority had concluded that the coverage of Title VI was coextensive with the coverage of the Equal Protection Clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[23]  Like any other type of evidence, contextual evidence may be trumped by other more persuasive evidence. Thus, the fact that, when evaluating older statutes, we have at times reached the conclusion that Congress did not imply a private right of action does not have the significance the majority suggests. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 287-288.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[24]  Only one of this Court's myriad private right of action cases even hints at such a rule. See &lt;i&gt;Central Bank of Denver, N. A.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A.,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S. 164, 173 (1994). Even that decision, however, does not fully support the majority's position for two important reasons. First, it is not at all clear that the majority opinion in that case simply held that the regulation in question could not be enforced by private action; the opinion also permits the reading, assumed by the dissent, that the majority was in effect invalidating the regulation in question. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 200 (Stevens, J., dissenting) ("The majority leaves little doubt that the Exchange Act does not even permit the SEC to pursue aiders and abettors in civil enforcement actions under &#167; 10(b) and Rule 10b&#151;5"). Second, that case involved a right of action that the Court has forthrightly acknowledged was judicially created in exactly the way the majority now condemns. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blue Chip Stamps&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Manor Drug Stores,&lt;/i&gt; 421 U. S. 723, 737 (1975) (describing private actions under Rule 10b&#151;5 as "a judicial oak which has grown from little more than a legislative acorn"). As the action in question was in effect a common-law right, the Court was more within its rights to limit that remedy than it would be in a case, such as this one, where we have held that Congress clearly intended such a right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[25]  See &lt;i&gt;Guardians,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S., at 636 (Stevens, J., dissenting) ("It is one thing to conclude, as the Court did in &lt;i&gt;Cannon,&lt;/i&gt; that the 1964 Congress, legislating when implied causes of action were the rule rather than the exception, reasonably assumed that the intended beneficiaries of Title VI would be able to vindicate their rights in court. It is quite another thing to believe that the 1964 Congress substantially qualified that assumption but thought it unnecessary to tell the Judiciary about the qualification").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[26]  The majority suggests that its failure to offer such support is irrelevant, because the burden is on the party seeking to establish the existence of an implied right of action. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 293, n. 8. That response confuses apples and oranges. Undoubtedly, anyone seeking to bring a lawsuit has the burden of establishing that private individuals have the right to bring such a suit. However, once the courts have examined the statutory scheme under which the individual seeks to bring a suit and determined that a private right of action does exist, judges who seek to impose heretofore unrecognized limits on that right have a responsibility to offer reasoned arguments drawn from the text, structure, or history of that statute in order to justify such limitations. Moreover, in this case, the respondents &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; marshaled substantial affirmative evidence that a private right of action exists to enforce Title VI and the regulations validly promulgated thereunder. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 313. It strikes me that it aids rather than hinders their case that this evidence is already summarized in an opinion of this Court. See &lt;i&gt;Cannon,&lt;/i&gt; 441 U. S., at 691-703.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Syllabus&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After this Court found that North Carolina's legislature violated the Constitution by using race as the predominant factor in drawing its Twelfth Congressional District's 1992 boundaries, Shaw v. Hunt, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;517&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;899&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the State redrew those boundaries. A three-judge District Court subsequently granted appellees summary judgment, finding that the new 1997 boundaries had also been created with racial considerations dominating all others. This Court reversed, finding that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the evidence was consistent with a race-based objective or the constitutional political objective of creating a safe Democratic seat. Hunt v. Cromartie, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/6zki/hunt-v-cromartie/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;526&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;541&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Among other things, this Court relied on evidence proposed to be submitted by appellants to conclude that, because the State's African-American voters overwhelmingly voted Democratic, one could not easily distinguish a legislative effort to create a majority-minority district from a legislative effort to create a safely Democratic one; that data showing voter registration did not indicate how voters would actually vote; and that data about actual behavior could affect the litigation's outcome. Id., at 547-551. On remand, the District Court again held, after a 3-day trial, that the legislature had used race driven criteria in drawing the 1997 boundaries. It based that conclusion on three findings-the district's shape, its splitting of towns and counties, and its heavily African-American voting population-that this Court had considered when it found summary judgment inappropriate, and on the new finding that the legislature had drawn the boundaries to collect precincts with a high racial, rather than political, identification.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Held: The District Court's conclusion that the State violated the Equal Protection Clause in drawing the 1997 boundaries is based on clearly erroneous findings. Pp. 5-23.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(a) The issue here is evidentiary: whether there is adequate support for the District Court's finding that race, rather than politics, drove the legislature's districting decision. Those attacking the district have the demanding burden of proof to show that a facially neutral law is unexplainable on grounds other than race. Cromartie, supra, at 546. Because the underlying districting decision falls within a legislature's sphere of competence, Miller v. Johnson, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B4W/miller-v-johnson/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;515&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;900&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 915, courts must exercise extraordinary caution in adjudicating claims such as this one, id., at 916, especially where, as here, the State has articulated a legitimate political explanation for its districting decision and the voting population is one in which race and political affiliation are highly coordinated, see Cromartie, supra, at 551-552. This Court will review the District Court's findings only for "clear error," asking whether "on the entire evidence" the Court is "left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed." United States v. United States Gypsum Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x58/united-states-v-united-states-gypsum-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;333&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;364&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 395. An extensive review of the District Court's findings is warranted here because there was no intermediate court review, the trial was not lengthy, the key evidence consisted primarily of documents and expert testimony, and credibility evaluations played a minor role. Pp. 5-7.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(b) The critical District Court determination that "race, not politics," predominantly explains the 1997 boundaries rests upon the three findings that this Court found insufficient to support summary judgment, and which cannot in and of themselves, as a matter of law, support the District Court's judgment here. See Bush v. Vera, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B6b/george-w-bush-governor-of-texas-et-al/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;517&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;952&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 968. Its determination also rests upon five new subsidiary findings, which this Court also cannot accept as adequate. First, the District Court primarily relied on evidence of voting registration, not voting behavior, which is precisely the kind of evidence that this Court found inadequate the last time the case was here. White registered Democrats "cross-over" to vote Republican more often than do African-Americans, who register and vote Democratic between 95% and 97% of the time. Thus, a legislature trying to secure a safe Democratic seat by placing reliable Democratic precincts within a district may end up with a district containing more heavily African-American precincts for political, not racial, reasons. Second, the evidence to which appellees' expert, Dr. Weber, pointed-that a reliably Democratic voting population of 60% is necessary to create a safe Democratic seat, but this district was 63% reliable; that certain white-Democratic precincts were excluded while African-American-Democratic precincts were included; that one precinct was split between Districts 9 and 12; and that other plans would have created a safely Democratic district with fewer African-American precincts-simply does not provide significant additional support for the District Court's conclusion. Also, portions of Dr. Weber's testimony not cited by the District Court undercut his conclusions. Third, the District Court, while not accepting the contrary conclusion of appellants' expert, Dr. Peterson, did not (and as far as the record reveals, could not) reject much of the significant supporting factual information he provided, which showed that African-American Democratic voters were more reliably Democratic and that District 12's boundaries were drawn to include reliable Democrats. Fourth, a statement about racial balance made by Senator Cooper, the legislative redistricting leader, shows that the legislature considered race along with other partisan and geographic considerations, but says little about whether race played a predominant role. And an e-mail sent by Gerry Cohen, a legislative staff member responsible for drafting districting plans, offers some support for the District Court's conclusion, but is less persuasive than the kinds of direct evidence that this Court has found significant in other redistricting cases. Fifth, appellees' maps summarizing voting behavior evidence tend to refute the District Court's "race, not politics," conclusion. Pp. 7-22.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(c) The modicum of evidence supporting the District Court's conclusion-the Cohen e-mail, Senator Cooper's statement, and some aspects of Dr. Weber's testimony-taken together, does not show that racial considerations predominated in the boundaries' drawing, because race in this case correlates closely with political behavior. Where majority-minority districts are at issue and racial identification correlates highly with political affiliation, the party attacking the boundaries must show at the least that the legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are comparably consistent with traditional districting principles and that those alternatives would have brought about significantly greater racial balance. Because appellees failed to make any such showing here, the District Court's contrary findings are clearly erroneous. Pp. 22-23.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Reversed.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In this appeal, we review a three-judge District Court's determination that North Carolina's legislature used race as the "predominant factor" in drawing its 12th Congressional District's 1997 boundaries. The court's findings, in our view, are clearly erroneous. We therefore reverse its conclusion that the State violated the Equal Protection Clause. U.S. Const., Amdt. 14, 1.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;* In Shaw I, the Court considered whether plaintiffs' factual allegation-that the legislature had drawn the former district's boundaries for race-based reasons-if true, could underlie a legal holding that the legislature had violated the Equal Protection Clause. The Court held that it could. It wrote that a violation may exist where the legislature's boundary drawing, though "race neutral on its face," nonetheless can be understood only as an effort to "separate voters into different districts on the basis of race," and where the "separation lacks sufficient justification." 509 U.S., at 649.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p4"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In Shaw II, the Court reversed a subsequent three-judge District Court's holding that the boundary-drawing law in question did not violate the Constitution. This Court found that the district's "unconventional," snakelike shape, the way in which its boundaries split towns and counties, its predominately African-American racial make-up, and its history, together demonstrated a deliberate effort to create a "majority-black" district in which race "could not be compromised," not simply a district designed to "protec[t] Democratic incumbents." 517 U.S., at 902-903, 905-907. And the Court concluded that the legislature's use of racial criteria was not justified. Id., at 909-918.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;B&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p5"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our third holding focused on a new District 12, the boundaries of which the legislature had redrawn in 1997. Hunt v. Cromartie, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/6zki/hunt-v-cromartie/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;526&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;541&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1999). A three-judge District Court, with one judge dissenting, had granted summary judgment in favor of those challenging the district's boundaries. The court found that the legislature again had "used criteria . . . that are facially race driven," in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. App. to Juris. Statement 262a. It based this conclusion upon "uncontroverted material facts" showing that the boundaries created an unusually shaped district, split counties and cities, and in particular placed almost all heavily Democratic-registered, predominantly African-American voting precincts, inside the district while locating some heavily Democratic-registered, predominantly white precincts, outside the district. This latter circumstance, said the court, showed that the legislature was trying to maximize new District 12's African-American voting strength, not the district's Democratic voting strength. Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p6"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This Court reversed. We agreed with the District Court that the new district's shape, the way in which it split towns and counties, and its heavily African-American voting population all helped the plaintiffs' case. 526 U.S., at 547-549. But neither that evidence by itself, nor when coupled with the evidence of Democratic registration, was sufficient to show, on summary judgment, the unconstitutional race-based objective that plaintiffs claimed. That is because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the evidence also was consistent with a constitutional political objective, namely, the creation of a safe Democratic seat. Id., at 549-551.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p7"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We pointed to the affidavit of an expert witness for defendants, Dr. David W. Peterson. Dr. Peterson offered to show that, because North Carolina's African-American voters are overwhelmingly Democratic voters, one cannot easily distinguish a legislative effort to create a majority-African-American district from a legislative effort to create a safely Democratic district. Id., at 550. And he also provided data showing that registration did not indicate how voters would actually vote. Id., at 550-551. We agreed that data showing how voters actually behave, not data showing only how those voters are registered, could affect the outcome of this litigation. Ibid. We concluded that the case was "not suited for summary disposition" and we reversed the District Court. Id., at 554.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p8"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;On remand, the parties undertook additional discovery. The three-judge District Court held a 3-day trial. And the court again held (over a dissent) that the legislature had unconstitutionally drawn District 12's new 1997 boundaries. It found that the legislature had tried "(1) [to] cur[e] the [previous district's] constitutional defects" while also "(2) drawing the plan to maintain the existing partisan balance in the State's congressional delegation." App. to Juris. Statement 11a. It added that to "achieve the second goal," the legislature "drew the new plan (1) to avoid placing two incumbents in the same district and (2) to preserve the partisan core of the existing districts." Ibid. The court concluded that the "plan as enacted largely reflects these directives." Ibid. But the court also found "as a matter of fact that the General Assembly . . . used criteria . . . that are facially race driven" without any compelling justification for doing so. Id., at 28a.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p9"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The court based its latter, constitutionally critical, conclusion in part upon the district's snakelike shape, the way in which it split cities and towns, and its heavily African-American (47%) voting population, id., at 11a-17a-all matters that this Court had considered when it found summary judgment inappropriate, Cromartie, supra, at 544. The court also based this conclusion upon a specific finding-absent when we previously considered this litigation-that the legislature had drawn the boundaries in order "to collect precincts with high racial identification rather than political identification." App. to Juris. Statement 28a-29a (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p10"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This last-mentioned finding rested in turn upon five subsidiary determinations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p11"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(1) that "the legislators excluded many heavily-Democratic precincts from District 12, even when those precincts immediately border the Twelfth and would have established a far more compact district," id., at 25a; see also id., at 29a ("more heavily Democratic precincts ... were bypassed ... in favor of precincts with a higher African-American population");&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p12"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(2) that "[a]dditionally, Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Weber, showed time and again how race trumped party affiliation in the construction of the 12th District and how political explanations utterly failed to explain the composition of the district," id., at 26a;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p13"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(3) that Dr. Peterson's testimony was " 'unreliable' and not relevant," id., at 27a (citing testimony of Dr. Weber);&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p14"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(4) that a legislative redistricting leader, Senator Roy Cooper, had alluded at the time of redistricting "to a need for 'racial and partisan' balance," ibid.; and&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p15"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(5) that the Senate's redistricting coordinator, Gerry Cohen, had sent Senator Cooper an e-mail reporting that Cooper had "moved Greensboro Black community into the 12th, and now need[ed] to take [about] 60,000 out of the 12th," App. 369; App. to Juris. Statement 27a-28a.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p16"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The State and intervenors filed a notice of appeal. 28 U.S.C.  1253. We noted probable jurisdiction. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;530&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1260&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (2000). And we now reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;II&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p17"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The issue in this case is evidentiary. We must determine whether there is adequate support for the District Court's key findings, particularly the ultimate finding that the legislature's motive was predominantly racial, not political. In making this determination, we are aware that, under Shaw I and later cases, the burden of proof on the plaintiffs (who attack the district) is a "demanding one." Miller v. Johnson, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B4W/miller-v-johnson/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;515&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;900&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 928 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurring). The Court has specified that those who claim that a legislature has improperly used race as a criterion, in order, for example, to create a majority-minority district, must show at a minimum that the "legislature subordinated traditional race-neutral districting principles . . . to racial considerations." Id., at 916 (majority opinion). Race must not simply have been "a motivation for the drawing of a majority minority district," Bush v. Vera, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B6b/george-w-bush-governor-of-texas-et-al/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;517&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;952&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 959 (1996) (O'Connor, J., principal opinion) (emphasis in original), but "the 'predominant factor' motivating the legislature's districting decision," Cromartie, 526 U.S., at 547 (quoting Miller, supra, at 916) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs must show that a facially neutral law " 'is "unexplainable on grounds other than race." ' " Cromartie, supra, at 546 (quoting Shaw I, 509 U.S., at 644, in turn quoting Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yzc/arlington-heights-v-metropolitan-housing-developme/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;429&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;252&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 266 (1977)).   The Court also has made clear that the underlying districting decision is one that ordinarily falls within a legislature's sphere of competence. Miller, 515 U.S., at 915. Hence, the legislature "must have discretion to exercise the political judgment necessary to balance competing interests," ibid., and courts must "exercise extraordinary caution in adjudicating claims that a State has drawn district lines on the basis of race," id., at 916 (emphasis added). Caution is especially appropriate in this case, where the State has articulated a legitimate political explanation for its districting decision, and the voting population is one in which race and political affiliation are highly correlated. See Cromartie, supra, at 551-552 (noting that "[e]vidence that blacks constitute even a supermajority in one congressional district while amounting to less than a plurality in a neighboring district will not, by itself, suffice to prove that a jurisdiction was motivated by race in drawing its district lines when the evidence also shows a high correlation between race and party preference").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p18"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We also are aware that we review the District Court's findings only for "clear error." In applying this standard, we, like any reviewing court, will not reverse a lower court's finding of fact simply because we "would have decided the case differently." Anderson v. Bessemer City, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z7e/anderson-v-bessemer-city/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;470&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;564&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 573 (1985). Rather, a reviewing court must ask whether "on the entire evidence," it is "left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed." United States v. United States Gypsum Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x58/united-states-v-united-states-gypsum-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;333&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;364&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 395 (1948).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p19"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Where an intermediate court reviews, and affirms, a trial court's factual findings, this Court will not "lightly overturn" the concurrent findings of the two lower courts. E.g., Neil v. Biggers, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yi6/neil-v-biggers/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;409&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;188&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 193, n. 3 (1972). But in this instance there is no intermediate court, and we are the only court of review. Moreover, the trial here at issue was not lengthy and the key evidence consisted primarily of documents and expert testimony. Credibility evaluations played a minor role. Accordingly, we find that an extensive review of the District Court's findings, for clear error, is warranted. See Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z3C/bose-corp-v-consumers-union-of-united-states-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;466&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;485&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 500-501 (1984). That review leaves us "with the definite and firm conviction," United States Gypsum Co., supra, at 395, that the District Court's key findings are mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;III&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p20"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The critical District Court determination-the matter for which we remanded this litigation-consists of the finding that race rather than politics predominantly explains District 12's 1997 boundaries. That determination rests upon three findings (the district's shape, its splitting of towns and counties, and its high African-American voting population) that we previously found insufficient to support summary judgment. Cromartie, supra, at 547-549. Given the undisputed evidence that racial identification is highly correlated with political affiliation in North Carolina, these facts in and of themselves cannot, as a matter of law, support the District Court's judgment. See Vera, 517 U.S., at 968 (O'Connor, J., principal opinion) ("If district lines merely correlate with race because they are drawn on the basis of political affiliation, which correlates with race, there is no racial classification to justify"). The District Court rested, however, upon five new subsidiary findings to conclude that District 12's lines are the product of no "mer[e] correlat[ion]," ibid., but are instead a result of the predominance of race in the legislature's line-drawing process. See supra, at 5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p21"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In considering each subsidiary finding, we have given weight to the fact that the District Court was familiar with this litigation, heard the testimony of each witness, and considered all the evidence with care. Nonetheless, we cannot accept the District Court's findings as adequate for reasons which we shall spell out in detail and which we can summarize as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p22"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;First, the primary evidence upon which the District Court relied for its "race, not politics," conclusion is evidence of voting registration, not voting behavior; and that is precisely the kind of evidence that we said was inadequate the last time this case was before us. See infra, at 9-10. Second, the additional evidence to which appellees' expert, Dr. Weber, pointed, and the statements made by Senator Cooper and Gerry Cohen, simply do not provide significant additional support for the District Court's conclusion. See infra, at 10-15, 17-19. Third, the District Court, while not accepting the contrary conclusion of appellants' expert, Dr. Peterson, did not (and as far as the record reveals, could not) reject much of the significant supporting factual information he provided. See infra, at 15-17. Fourth, in any event, appellees themselves have provided us with charts summarizing evidence of voting behavior and those charts tend to refute the court's "race not politics" conclusion. See infra, at 19-21; Appendixes, infra.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p23"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;* The District Court primarily based its "race, not politics," conclusion upon its finding that "the legislators excluded many heavily-Democratic precincts from District 12, even when those precincts immediately border the Twelfth and would have established a far more compact district." App. to Juris. Statement 25a; see also id., at 29a ("[M]ore heavily Democratic precincts ... were bypassed ... in favor of precincts with a higher African-American population"). This finding, however-insofar as it differs from the remaining four-rests solely upon evidence that the legislature excluded heavily white precincts with high Democratic Party registration, while including heavily African-American precincts with equivalent, or lower, Democratic Party registration. See id., at 13a-14a, 17a. Indeed, the District Court cites at length figures showing that the legislature included "several precincts with racial compositions of 40 to 100 percent African-American," while excluding certain adjacent precincts "with less than 35 percent African-American population" but which contain between 54% and 76% registered Democrats. Id., at 13a-14a.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p24"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As we said before, the problem with this evidence is that it focuses upon party registration, not upon voting behavior. And we previously found the same evidence, compare ibid. (District Court's opinion after trial) with id., at 249a-250a (District Court's summary judgment opinion), inadequate because registration figures do not accurately predict preference at the polls. See id., at 174a; see also Cromartie, 526 U.S., at 550-551 (describing Dr. Peterson's analysis as "more thorough" because in North Carolina, "party registration and party preference do not always correspond"). In part this is because white voters registered as Democrats "cross-over" to vote for a Republican candidate more often than do African-Americans, who register and vote Democratic between 95% and 97% of the time. See Record, Deposition of Gerry Cohen 37-42 (discussing data); App. 304 (stating that white voters cast about 60% to 70% of their votes for Republican candidates); id., at 139 (Dr. Weber's testimony that 95% to 97% of African-Americans register and vote as Democrats); see also id., at 118 (testimony by Dr. Weber that registration data were the least reliable information upon which to predict voter behavior). A legislature trying to secure a safe Democratic seat is interested in Democratic voting behavior. Hence, a legislature may, by placing reliable Democratic precincts within a district without regard to race, end up with a district containing more heavily African-American precincts, but the reasons would be political rather than racial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p25"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Insofar as the District Court relied upon voting registration data, particularly data that were previously before us, it tells us nothing new; and the data do not help answer the question posed when we previously remanded this litigation. Cromartie, supra, at 551.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;B&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p26"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The District Court wrote that "[a]dditionally, [p]laintiffs' expert, Dr. Weber, showed time and again how race trumped party affiliation in the construction of the 12th District and how political explanations utterly failed to explain the composition of the district." App. to Juris. Statement 26a. In support of this conclusion, the court relied upon six different citations to Dr. Weber's trial testimony. We have examined each reference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p27"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;* At the first cited pages of the trial transcript, Dr. Weber says that a reliably Democratic voting population of 60% is sufficient to create a safe Democratic seat. App. 91. Yet, he adds, the legislature created a more-than-60% reliable Democratic voting population in District 12. Hence (we read Dr. Weber to infer), the legislature likely was driven by race, not politics. Tr. 163; App. 314-315.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p28"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The record indicates, however, that, although Dr. Weber is right that District 12 is more than 60% reliably Democratic, it exceeds that figure by very little. Nor did Dr. Weber ask whether other districts, unchallenged by appellees, were significantly less "safe" than was District 12. Id., at 148. In fact the figures the legislature used showed that District 12 would be 63% reliably Democratic. App. to Juris. Statement 80a (Democratic vote over three representative elections averaged 63%). By the same measures, at least two Republican districts (Districts 6 and 10) are 61% reliably Republican. Ibid. And, as Dr. Weber conceded, incumbents might have urged legislators (trying to maintain a six/six Democrat/Republican delegation split) to make their seats, not 60% safe, but as safe as possible. App. 149. In a field such as voting behavior, where figures are inherently uncertain, Dr. Weber's tiny calculated percentage differences are simply too small to carry significant evidentiary weight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p29"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The District Court cited two parts of the transcript where Dr. Weber testified about a table he had prepared listing all precincts in the six counties, portions of which make up District 12. Tr. 204-205, 262. Dr. Weber said that District 12 contains between 39% and 56% of the precincts (depending on the county) that are more-than-40% reliably Democratic, but it contains almost every precinct with more-than-40% African-American voters. Id., at 204-205. Why, he essentially asks, if the legislature had had politics primarily in mind, would its effort to place reliably Democratic precincts within District 12 not have produced a greater racial mixture?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p30"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Dr. Weber's own testimony provides an answer to this question. As Dr. Weber agreed, the precincts listed in the table were at least 40% reliably Democratic, but virtually all the African-American precincts included in District 12 were more than 40% reliably Democratic. Moreover, none of the excluded white precincts were as reliably Democratic as the African-American precincts that were included in the district. App. 140. Yet the legislature sought precincts that were reliably Democratic, not precincts that were 40%-reliably Democratic, for obvious political reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p31"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Neither does the table specify whether the excluded white-reliably-Democratic precincts were located near enough to District 12's boundaries or each other for the legislature as a practical matter to have drawn District 12's boundaries to have included them, without sacrificing other important political goals. The contrary is suggested by the fact that Dr. Weber's own proposed alternative plan, see id., at 106-107, would have pitted two incumbents against each other (Sue Myrick, a Republican from former District 9 and Mel Watt, a Democrat from former District 12). Dr. Weber testified that such a result-"a very competitive race with one of them losing their seat"-was desirable. Id., at 153. But the legislature, for political, not racial, reasons, believed the opposite. And it drew its plan to protect incumbents-a legitimate political goal recognized by the District Court. App. to Juris. Statement 11a.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p32"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For these reasons, Dr. Weber's table offers little insight into the legislature's true motive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p33"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The next part of the transcript the District Court cited contains Dr. Weber's testimony about a Mecklenburg County precinct (precinct 77) which the legislature split between Districts 9 and 12. Tr. 221. Dr. Weber apparently thought that the legislature did not have to split this precinct, placing the more heavily African-American segment within District 12-unless, of course, its motive was racial rather than political. But Dr. Weber simultaneously conceded that he had not considered whether District 9's incumbent Republican would have wanted the whole of precinct 77 left in her own district where it would have burdened her with a significant additional number of reliably Democratic voters. App. 156-157. Nor had Dr. Weber "test[ed]" his conclusion that this split helped to show a racial (rather than political) motive, say, by adjusting other boundary lines and determining the political, or other nonracial, consequences of such adjustments. Id., at 132.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p34"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The maps in evidence indicate that to have placed all of precinct 77 within District 12 would have created a District 12 peninsula that invaded District 9, neatly dividing that latter district in two, see id., at 496-a conclusive nonracial reason for the legislature's decision not to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p35"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The District Court cited Dr. Weber's conclusion that "race is the predominant factor." Tr. 251. But this statement of the conclusion is no stronger than the evidence that underlies it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p36"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;36&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The District Court's final citation is to Dr. Weber's assertion that there are other ways in which the legislature could have created a safely Democratic district without placing so many primarily African-American districts within District 12. Id., at 288. And we recognize that some such other ways may exist. But, unless the evidence also shows that these hypothetical alternative districts would have better satisfied the legislature's other nonracial political goals as well as traditional nonracial districting principles, this fact alone cannot show an improper legislative motive. After all, the Constitution does not place an affirmative obligation upon the legislature to avoid creating districts that turn out to be heavily, even majority, minority. It simply imposes an obligation not to create such districts for predominantly racial, as opposed to political or traditional, districting motivations. And Dr. Weber's testimony does not, at the pages cited, provide evidence of a politically practical alternative plan that the legislature failed to adopt predominantly for racial reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p37"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;37&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In addition, we have read the whole of Dr. Weber's testimony, including portions not cited by the District Court. Some of those portions further undercut Dr. Weber's conclusions. Dr. Weber said, for example, that he had developed those conclusions while under the erroneous impression that the legislature's computer-based districting program provided information about racial, but not political, balance. App. 137-138; see also id., at 302 (reflecting Dr. Weber's erroneous impression in the declaration he submitted to the District Court). He also said he was not aware of "anything about political dynamics going on in the [l]egislature involving" District 12, id., at 135, sometimes expressing disdain for a process that we have cautioned courts to respect, id., at 150-151; Miller, 515 U.S., at 915-916.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p38"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;38&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Other portions support Dr. Weber's conclusions. Dr. Weber testified, for example, about a different alternative plan that, in his view, would have provided both greater racial balance and political security, namely, a plan that the legislature did enact in 1998, and which has been in effect during the time the courts have been reviewing the constitutionality of the 1997 plan. App. 156-157. The existence of this alternative plan, however, cannot help appellees significantly. Although it created a somewhat more compact district, it still divides many communities along racial lines, while providing fewer reliably Democratic District 12 voters and transferring a group of highly Democratic precincts into two safely Republican districts, namely, the 5th and 6th Districts, which political result the 1997 plan sought to avoid. See Tr. 352, 355. Furthermore, the 1997 plan before this Court, unlike the 1998 plan, joined three major cities in a manner legislators regarded as reflecting "a real commonality of urban interests, with inner city schools, urban health care ... problems, public housing problems." App. 430 (statement of Sen. Winner); see also id., at 421 (statement of Sen. Martin). Consequently, we cannot tell whether the existence of the 1998 plan shows that the 1997 plan was drawn with racial considerations predominant. And, in any event, the District Court did not rely upon the existence of the 1998 plan to support its ultimate conclusion. See Kelley v. Everglades Drainage Dist., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wSu/kelley-v-everglades-drainage-dist/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;319&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;415&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 420-422 (1943) (per curiam).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p39"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;39&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We do not see how Dr. Weber's testimony, taken as a whole, could have provided more than minimal support for the District Court's conclusion that race predominantly underlay the legislature's districting decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p40"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The District Court found that the testimony of the State's primary expert, Dr. Peterson, was " 'unreliable' and not relevant." App. to Juris. Statement 27a (quoting Dr. Weber and citing Tr. 222-224, 232). Dr. Peterson's testimony was designed to show that African-American Democratic voters were more reliably Democratic and that District 12's boundaries were drawn to include reliable Democrats. Specifically, Dr. Peterson compared precincts immediately within District 12 and those immediately without to determine whether the boundaries of the district corresponded better with race than with politics. The principle underlying Dr. Peterson's analysis is that if the district were drawn with race predominantly in mind, one would expect the boundaries of the district to correlate with race more than with politics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p41"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;41&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The pages cited in support of the District Court's rejection of Dr. Peterson's conclusions contain testimony by Dr. Weber, who says that Dr. Peterson's analysis is unreliable because (1) it "ignor[es] the core" of the district, id., at 223, and (2) it fails to take account of the fact that different precincts have different populations, id., at 223-224. The first matter-ignoring the "core"-apparently reflects Dr. Weber's view that in context the fact that District 12's heart or "core" is heavily African-American by itself shows that the legislature's motive was predominantly racial, not political. The District Court did not argue that the racial makeup of a district's "core" is critical. Nor do we see why "core" makeup alone could help the court discern the relevant legislative motive. Nothing here suggests that only "core" makeup could answer the "political/racial" question that this Court previously found critical. Cromartie, 526 U.S., at 551-552.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p42"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The second matter-that Dr. Peterson's boundary segment analysis did not account for differences in population between precincts-relates to one aspect of Dr. Peterson's testimony. Appellants presented Dr. Peterson's testimony and data in support of four propositions: first, that registration figures do not accurately reflect actual voting behavior, see App. to Juris. Statement 173a-174a; second, that African-Americans are more reliable Democrats than whites, see id., at 159a-160a; third, that political affiliation explains splitting cities and counties as well as does race, see id., at 189a, 191a-192a, 182a-185a; and fourth, that differences in the racial and political makeup of the precincts just inside and outside the boundaries of District 12 show that politics is as good an explanation as is race for the district's boundaries, see id., at 161a-167a; 181a-182a. The District Court's criticism of Dr. Peterson's testimony at most affects the reliability of the fourth element of Dr. Peterson's testimony, his special boundary segment analysis. The District Court's criticism of Dr. Peterson's boundary segment analysis does not undermine the data related to the split communities. The criticism does not undercut Dr. Peterson's presentation of statistical evidence showing that registration was a poor indicator of party preference and that African-Americans are much more reliably Democratic voters, nor have we found in the record any significant evidence refuting that data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p43"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;43&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At the same time, appellees themselves have used the information available in the record to create maps comparing the district's boundaries with Democrat/Republican voting behavior. See Appendixes A, B, and C, infra. Because no one challenges the accuracy of these maps, we assume that they are reliable; and we can assume that Dr. Peterson's testimony is reliable insofar as it confirms what the maps themselves contain and appellees themselves concede. Those maps, with certain exceptions discussed below, see infra, at 19-21, further indicate that the legislature drew boundaries that, in general, placed more-reliably Democratic voters inside the district, while placing less-reliably Democratic voters outside the district. And that fact, in turn, supports the State's answers to the questions we previously found critical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;D&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p44"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;44&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The District Court also relied on two pieces of "direct" evidence of discriminatory intent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p45"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;45&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;* The court found that a legislative redistricting leader, Senator Roy Cooper, when testifying before a legislative committee in 1997, had said that the 1997 plan satisfies a "need for 'racial and partisan' balance." App. to Juris. Statement 27a. The court concluded that the words "racial balance" referred to a 10-to-2 Caucasian/African-American balance in the State's 12-member congressional delegation. Ibid. Hence, Senator Cooper had admitted that the legislature had drawn the plan with race in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p46"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;46&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Senator Cooper's full statement reads as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p47"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;47&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Those of you who dealt with Redistricting before realize that you cannot solve each problem that you encounter and everyone can find a problem with this Plan. However, I think that overall it provides for a fair, geographic, racial and partisan balance throughout the State of North Carolina. I think in order to come to an agreement all sides had to give a little bit, but I think we've reached an agreement that we can live with." App. 460.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p48"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;48&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We agree that one can read the statement about "racial ... balance" as the District Court read it-to refer to the current congressional delegation's racial balance. But even as so read, the phrase shows that the legislature considered race, along with other partisan and geographic considerations; and as so read it says little or nothing about whether race played a predominant role comparatively speaking. See Vera, 517 U.S., at 958 (O'Connor, J., principal opinion) ("Strict scrutiny does not apply merely because redistricting is performed with consciousness of race"); see also Miller, 515 U.S., at 916 (legislatures "will ... almost always be aware of racial demographics"); Shaw I, 509 U.S., at 646 (same).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p49"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;49&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The second piece of "direct" evidence relied upon by the District Court is a February 10, 1997, e-mail sent from Gerry Cohen, a legislative staff member responsible for drafting districting plans, to Senator Cooper and Senator Leslie Winner. Cohen wrote: "I have moved Greensboro Black community into the 12th, and now need to take [about] 60,000 out of the 12th. I await your direction on this." App. 369.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p50"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The reference to race-i.e., "Black community"-is obvious. But the e-mail does not discuss the point of the reference. It does not discuss why Greensboro's African-American voters were placed in the 12th District; it does not discuss the political consequences of failing to do so; it is addressed only to two members of the legislature; and it suggests that the legislature paid less attention to race in respect to the 12th District than in respect to the 1st District, where the e-mail provides a far more extensive, detailed discussion of racial percentages. It is less persuasive than the kinds of direct evidence we have found significant in other redistricting cases. See Vera, supra, at 959 (O'Connor, J., principal opinion) (State conceded that one of its goals was to create a majority-minority district); Miller, supra, at 907 (State set out to create majority-minority district); Shaw II, 517 U.S., at 906 (recounting testimony by Cohen that creating a majority-minority district was the "principal reason" for the 1992 version of District 12). Nonetheless, the e-mail offers some support for the District Court's conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;E&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p51"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;51&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As we have said, we assume that the maps appended to appellees' brief reflect the record insofar as that record describes the relation between District 12's boundaries and reliably Democratic voting behavior. Consequently we shall consider appellees' related claims, made on appeal, that the maps provide significant support for the District Court, in that they show how the legislature might have "swapped" several more heavily African-American District 12 precincts for other less heavily African-American adjacent precincts-without harming its basic "safely Democratic" political objective. Cf. supra, at 10-11.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p52"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;52&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;First, appellees suggest, without identifying any specific swap, that the legislature could have brought within District 12 several reliably Democratic, primarily white, precincts in Forsyth County. See Brief for Appellees 30. None of these precincts, however, is more reliably Democratic than the precincts immediately adjacent and within District 12. See Appendix A, infra (showing Demo-cratic strength reflected by Republican victories in each precinct); App. 484 (showing Democratic strength re-flected by Democratic registration). One of them, the Brown/Douglas Recreation Precinct, is heavily African-American. See ibid. And the remainder form a buffer between the home precinct of Fifth District Representative Richard Burr and the District 12 border, such that their removal from District 5 would deprive Representative Burr of a large portion of his own hometown, making him more vulnerable to a challenge from elsewhere within his district. App. to Juris. Statement 209a; App. 623. Consequently the Forsyth County precincts do not significantly help appellees' "race not politics" thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p53"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Second, appellees say that the legislature might have swapped two District 12 Davidson County precincts (Thomasville 1 and Lexington 3) for a District 6 Guilford County precinct (Greensboro 17). See Brief for Appellees 30, n. 25. Whatever the virtues of such a swap, however, it would have diminished the size of District 12, geographically producing an unusually narrow isthmus linking District 12's north with its south and demographically producing the State's smallest district, deviating by about 1,300 below the legislatively endorsed ideal mean of 552,386 population. Traditional districting considerations consequently militated against any such swap. See Record, Deposition of Linwood Lee Jones 122 (stating that legislature's goal was to keep deviations from ideal population to less than 1,000); App. 199 (testimony of Sen. Cooper to same effect).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p54"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;54&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Third, appellees suggest that, in Mecklenburg County, two District 12 precincts (Charlotte 81 and LCI-South) be swapped with two District 9 precincts (Charlotte 10 and 21). See Brief for Appellees 30, n. 25. This suggestion is difficult to evaluate, as the parties provide no map that specifically identifies each precinct in Mecklenburg County by name. Nonetheless, from what we can tell, such a swap would make the district marginally more white (decreasing the African-American population by about 300 persons) while making the shape more questionable, leaving the precinct immediately to the south of Charlotte 81 jutting out into District 9. We are not convinced that this proposal materially advances appellees' claim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p55"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;55&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Fourth, appellees argue that the legislature could have swapped two reliably Democratic Greensboro precincts outside District 12 (11 and 14) for four reliably Republican High Point precincts (1, 13, 15, and 19) placed within District 12. See ibid. The swap would not have improved racial balance significantly, however, for each of the six precincts have an African-American population of less than 35%. Additionally, it too would have altered the shape of District 12 for the worse. See Appendix D, infra; see also App. 622 (testimony of Gerry Cohen). And, in any event, the decision to exclude the two Greensboro precincts seems to reflect the legislature's decision to draw boundaries that follow main thoroughfares in Guilford County. App. to Juris. Statement 205a; App. 575.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p56"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;56&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Even if our judgments in respect to a few of these precincts are wrong, a showing that the legislature might have "swapped" a handful of precincts out of a total of 154 precincts, involving a population of a few hundred out of a total population of about half a million, cannot significantly strengthen appellees' case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IV&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p57"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;57&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We concede the record contains a modicum of evidence offering support for the District Court's conclusion. That evidence includes the Cohen e-mail, Senator Cooper's reference to "racial balance," and to a minor degree, some aspects of Dr. Weber's testimony. The evidence taken together, however, does not show that racial considerations predominated in the drawing of District 12's boundaries. That is because race in this case correlates closely with political behavior. The basic question is whether the legislature drew District 12's boundaries because of race rather than because of political behavior (coupled with traditional, nonracial districting considerations). It is not, as the dissent contends, see post, at 9, whether a legislature may defend its districting decisions based on a "stereotype" about African-American voting behavior. And given the fact that the party attacking the legislature's decision bears the burden of proving that racial considerations are "dominant and controlling," Miller, 515 U.S., at 913, given the "demanding" nature of that burden of proof, id., at 929 (O'Connor, J., concurring), and given the sensitivity, the "extraordinary caution," that district courts must show to avoid treading upon legislative prerogatives, id., at 916 (majority opinion), the attacking party has not successfully shown that race, rather than politics, predominantly accounts for the result. The record leaves us with the "definite and firm conviction," United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S., at 395, that the District Court erred in finding to the contrary. And we do not believe that providing appellees a further opportunity to make their "precinct swapping" arguments in the District Court could change this result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p58"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;58&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We can put the matter more generally as follows: In a case such as this one where majority-minority districts (or the approximate equivalent) are at issue and where racial identification correlates highly with political affiliation, the party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries must show at the least that the legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are comparably consistent with traditional districting principles. That party must also show that those districting alternatives would have brought about significantly greater racial balance. Appellees failed to make any such showing here. We conclude that the District Court's contrary findings are clearly erroneous. Because of this disposition, we need not address appellants' alternative grounds for reversal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p59"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;59&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The judgment of the District Court is Reversed.       Thomas, J., dissenting&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p60"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p61"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;61&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The issue for the District Court was whether racial considerations were predominant in the design of North Carolina's Congressional District 12. The issue for this Court is simply whether the District Court's factual finding-that racial considerations did predominate-was clearly erroneous. Because I do not believe the court below committed clear error, I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p62"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;62&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;* The District Court's conclusion that race was the predominant factor motivating the North Carolina Legislature is a factual finding. See Hunt v. Cromartie, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/6zki/hunt-v-cromartie/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;526&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;541&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 549 (1999); Lawyer v.

Johnson, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B4W/miller-v-johnson/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;515&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;900&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 910 (1995). See also Anderson v. Bessemer City, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z7e/anderson-v-bessemer-city/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;470&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;564&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 573 (1985) ("[I]ntentional discrimination is a finding of fact ..."). Accordingly, we should not overturn the District Court's determination unless it is clearly erroneous. See Lawyer, supra, at 580; Shaw, supra, at 910; Miller, supra, at 917. We are not permitted to reverse the court's finding "simply because [we are] convinced that [we] would have decided the case differently." Anderson, supra, at 573. "Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous." 470 U.S., at 574. We should upset the District Court's finding only if we are " 'left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.' " Id., at 573 (quoting United States v. United States Gypsum Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x58/united-states-v-united-states-gypsum-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;333&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;364&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 395 (1948)).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p63"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;63&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Court does cite cases that address the correct standard of review, see ante, at 7, and does couch its conclusion in "clearly erroneous" terms, see ante, at 22-23. But these incantations of the correct standard are empty gestures, contradicted by the Court's conclusion that it must engage in "extensive review." See ante, at 7. In several ways, the Court ignores its role as a reviewing court and engages in its own factfinding enterprise.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; First, the Court suggests that there is some significance to the absence of an intermediate court in this action. See ibid. This cannot be a legitimate consideration. If it were legitimate, we would have mentioned it in prior redistricting cases. After all, in Miller and Shaw, we also did not have the benefit of intermediate appellate review. See also United States v. Oregon State Medical Soc., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xdp/united-states-v-oregon-state-medical-soc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;343&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;326&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 330, 332 (1952) (engaging in clear error review of factual findings in a Sherman Act case where there was no intermediate appellate review). In these cases, we stated that the standard was simply "clearly erroneous." Moreover, the implication of the Court's argument is that intermediate courts, because they are the first reviewers of the factfinder's conclusions, should engage in a level of review more rigorous than clear error review. This suggestion is not supported by law. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a) ("Findings of fact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous ..."). In fact, the very case the Court cited to articulate clear error review discussed the standard as it applied to an intermediate appellate court, which obviously did not have the benefit of another layer of review. See ante, at 7 (citing Anderson, supra, at 573).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p64"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Second, the Court appears to discount clear error review here because the trial was "not lengthy." Ante, at 7. Even if considerations such as the length of the trial were relevant in deciding how to review factual findings, an assumption about which I have my doubts,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; these considerations would not counsel against deference in this action. The trial was not "just a few hours" long, Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z3C/bose-corp-v-consumers-union-of-united-states-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;466&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;485&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 500 (1984); it lasted for three days in which the court heard the testimony of 12 witnesses. And quite apart from the total trial time, the District Court sifted through hundreds of pages of deposition testimony and expert analysis, including statistical analysis. It also should not be forgotten that one member of the panel has reviewed the iterations of District 12 since 1992. If one were to calibrate clear error review according to the trier of fact's familiarity with the case, there is simply no question that the court here gained a working knowledge of the facts of this litigation in myriad ways over a period far longer than three days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p65"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;65&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Third, the Court downplays deference to the District Court's finding by highlighting that the key evidence was expert testimony requiring no traditional credibility determinations. See ante, at 7. As a factual matter, the Court overlooks the District Court's express assessment of the legislative redistricting leader's credibility. See App. to Juris. Statement in No. 99-1864, pp. 27a, 28a, n. 8. It is also likely that the court's interpretation of the e-mail written by Gerry Cohen, the primary drafter of District 12, was influenced by its evaluation of Cohen as a witness. See id., at 28a, n. 8. See also App. 261-268. And, as a legal matter, the Court's emphasis on the technical nature of the evidence misses the mark. Although we have recognized that particular weight should be given to a trial court's credibility determinations, we have never held that factual findings based on documentary evidence and expert testimony justify "extensive review," ante, at 7. On the contrary, we explained in Anderson that "[t]he rationale for deference ... is not limited to the superiority of the trial judge's position to make determinations of credibility." 470 U.S., at 574. See also Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a) (specifically referring to oral and documentary evidence). Instead, the rationale for deference extends to all determinations of fact because of the trial judge's "expertise" in making such determinations. 470 U.S., at 574. Accordingly, deference to the factfinder "is the rule, not the exception," id., at 575, and I see no reason to depart from this rule in the case before us now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p66"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;66&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Finally, perhaps the best evidence that the Court has emptied clear error review of meaningful content in the redistricting context (and the strongest testament to the fact that the District Court was dealing with a complex fact pattern) is the Court's foray into the minutiae of the record. I do not doubt this Court's ability to sift through volumes of facts or to argue its interpretation of those facts persuasively. But I do doubt the wisdom, efficiency, increased accuracy, and legitimacy of an extensive review that is any more searching than clear error review. See id., 574-575 ("Duplication of the trial judge's efforts . . . would very likely contribute only negligibly to the accuracy of fact determination at a huge cost in diversion of judicial resources"). Thus, I would follow our precedents and simply review the District Court's finding for clear error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;II&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p67"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;67&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Reviewing for clear error, I cannot say that the District Court's view of the evidence was impermissible.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; First, the court relied on objective measures of compactness, which show that District 12 is the most geographically scattered district in North Carolina, to support its conclusion that the district's design was not dictated by traditional districting concerns. App. to Juris. Statement in No. 99-1864, p. 26a. Although this evidence was available when we held that summary judgment was inappropriate, we certainly did not hold that it was irrelevant in determining whether racial gerrymandering occurred. On the contrary, we determined that there was a triable issue of fact. Moreover, although we acknowledged "that a district's unusual shape can give rise to an inference of political motivation," we "doubt[ed] that a bizarre shape equally supports a political inference and a racial one." Hunt, 526 U.S., at 547, n. 3. As we explained, "[s]ome districts ... are 'so highly irregular that [they] rationally cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to segregat[e] ... voters' on the basis of race." Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p68"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;68&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Second, the court relied on the expert opinion of Dr. Weber, who interpreted statistical data to conclude that there were Democratic precincts with low black populations excluded from District 12, which would have created a more compact district had they been included.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; App. to Juris. Statement in No. 99-1864, p. 25a. And contrary to the Court's assertion, Dr. Weber did not merely examine the registration data in reaching his conclusions. Dr. Weber explained that he refocused his analysis on performance. He did so in response to our concerns, when we reversed the District Court's summary judgment finding, that voter registration might not be the best measure of the Democratic nature of a precinct. See id., at 26a (citing Trial Tr., which appears at App. 90-92, 105-107, 156-157). This fact was not lost on the District Court, which specifically referred to those pages of the record covering Dr. Weber's analysis of performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p69"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;69&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Third, the court credited Dr. Weber's testimony that the districting decisions could not be explained by political motives.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="fn5_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; App. to Juris. Statement in No. 99-1864, p. 26a. In the first instance, I, like the Court, ante, at 11, might well have concluded that District 12 was not significantly "safer" than several other districts in North Carolina merely because its Democratic reliability exceeded the optimum by only 3 percent. And I might have concluded that it would make political sense for incumbents to adopt a "the more reliable the better" policy in districting. However, I certainly cannot say that the court's inference from the facts was impermissible.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6" id="fn6_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p70"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;70&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Fourth, the court discredited the testimony of the State's witness, Dr. Peterson. App. to Juris. Statement in No. 99-1864, p. 27a (explaining that Dr. Weber testified that Dr. Peterson's analysis "ignor[ed] the core," "ha[d] not been appropriately done," and was "unreliable"). Again, like the Court, if I were a district court judge, I might have found that Dr. Weber's insistence that one could not ignore the core was unpersuasive.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn7" id="fn7_ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; However, even if the core could be ignored, it seems to me that Dr. Weber's testimony-that Dr. Peterson had failed to analyze all of the segments and thus that his analysis was incomplete, App. 119-120-reasonably could have supported the court's conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p71"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;71&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Finally, the court found that other evidence demonstrated that race was foremost on the legislative agenda: an e-mail from the drafter of the 1992 and 1997 plans to senators in charge of legislative redistricting, the computer capability to draw the district by race, and statements made by Senator Cooper that the legislature was going to be able to avoid Shaw's majority-minority trigger by ending just short of the majority.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn8" id="fn8_ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; App. to Juris. Statement in No. 99-1864, p. 28a. The e-mail, in combination with the indirect evidence, is evidence ample enough to support the District Court's finding for purposes of clear error review. The drafter of the redistricting plans reported in the bluntest of terms: "I have moved Greensboro Black community into the 12th [District], and now need to take ... 60,000 out of the 12th [District]." App. 369. Certainly the District Court was entitled to believe that the drafter was targeting voters and shifting district boundaries purely on the basis of race. The Court tries to belittle the import of this evidence by noting that the e-mail does not discuss why blacks were being targeted. See ante, at 18-19.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p72"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;72&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;However, the District Court was assigned the task of determining whether, not why, race predominated. As I see it, this inquiry is sufficient to answer the constitutional question because racial gerrymandering offends the Constitution whether the motivation is malicious or benign. It is not a defense that the legislature merely may have drawn the district based on the stereotype that blacks are reliable Democratic voters. And regardless of whether the e-mail tended to show that the legislature was operating under an even stronger racial motivation when it was drawing District 1 than when it was drawing District 12, cf. ante, at 19, I am convinced that the District Court permissibly could have accorded great weight to this e-mail as direct evidence of a racial motive. Surely, a decision can be racially motivated even if another decision was also racially motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p73"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;73&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If I were the District Court, I might have reached the same conclusion that the Court does, that "[t]he evidence taken together . . . does not show that racial considerations predominated in the drawing of District 12's boundaries," ante, at 22. But I am not the trier of fact, and it is not my role to weigh evidence in the first instance. The only question that this Court should decide is whether the District Court's finding of racial predominance was clearly erroneous. In light of the direct evidence of racial motive and the inferences that may be drawn from the circumstantial evidence, I am satisfied that the District Court's finding was permissible, even if not compelled by the record.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="footnotes"&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;NOTES:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn1"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Despite its citation of Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z3C/bose-corp-v-consumers-union-of-united-states-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;466&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;485&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1984), ante, at 7, I do not read the Court's opinion to suggest that the predominant factor inquiry, like the actual malice inquiry in Bose, should be reviewed de novo because it is a "constitutional fac[t]." 466 U.S., at 515 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). Nor could it, given our holdings in Lawyer v. Department of Justice, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B7V/lawyer-v-department-of-justice/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;521&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;567&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1997), Miller v. Johnson, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B4W/miller-v-johnson/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;515&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;900&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1995), and Shaw v. Hunt, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;517&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;899&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1996).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn2"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Bose, which the Court cites to support its discounting of clear error review, ante, at 7, does state that "the likelihood that the appellate court will rely on the presumption [of correctness of factual findings] tends to increase when trial judges have lived with the controversy for weeks or months instead of just a few hours." 466 U.S., at 500. It is unclear, however, what bearing this statement of fact-that appellate courts will defer to factual findings more often when the trial was long-had on our understanding of the scope of clear error review. In Bose, we held that a lower court's "actual malice" finding must be reviewed de novo, see id., at 514, not that clear error review must be calibrated to the length of trial.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn3"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; I assume, because the District Court did, that the goal of protecting incumbents is legitimate, even where, as here, individuals are incumbents by virtue of their election in an unconstitutional racially gerrymandered district. No doubt this assumption is a questionable proposition. Because the issue was not presented in this action, however, I do not read the Court's opinion as addressing it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn4"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; I do not think it necessary to impose a new burden on appellees to show that districting alternatives would have brought about "significantly greater racial balance." Ante, at 22. I cannot say that it was impermissible for the court to conclude that race predominated in this action even if only a slightly better district could be drawn absent racial considerations. The District Court may reasonably have found that racial motivations predominated in selecting one alternative over another even if the net effect on racial balance was not "significant."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn5"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Dr. Weber admitted that, when he first concluded that race was the motivating factor, he was under the mistaken impression that the legislature's computer program provided only racial, not political, data. The Court finds that this admission undercut the validity of Dr. Weber's conclusions. See ibid. Although the District Court could have found that this impression was a sufficiently significant assumption in Dr. Weber's analysis that the conclusions drawn from the analysis were suspect, it was not required to do so as a matter of logic. The court reasonably could have believed that the false impression had very little to do with the statistical analysis that was largely responsible for Dr. Weber's conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In addition, the Court discounts Dr. Weber's testimony because he "express[ed] disdain for a process that we have cautioned courts to respect," ibid. Dr. Weber did openly state that he believes that the best districts he had seen in the 1990's were those drawn by judges, not by legislatures. App. 150-151. However, whether Dr. Weber was simply stating the conclusions he has reached through his experience or was expressing a feeling of contempt toward the legislature is precisely the kind of tone, demeanor, and bias determination that even the Court acknowledges should be left to the factfinder, cf. ante, at 7.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn6"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The Court also criticizes Dr. Weber's testimony that Precinct 77's split was racially motivated and his proposed alternative that all of Precinct 77 could have been moved into District 9. Apparently the Court believes that it is obvious that the Republican incumbent in District 9 would not have wanted the whole of Precinct 77 in her district. See ante, at 12-13. But the Court addresses only part of Dr. Weber's alternative of how the districts could have been drawn in a race-neutral fashion. Dr. Weber explained that the alternative was not simply to move Precinct 77 into District 9. The alternative would also include moving other reliably Democratic precincts out of District 9 and into District 12, which presumably would have satisfied the incumbent. App. 157. This move would have had the result, not only of keeping Precinct 77 intact, but also of widening the corridor between the eastern and western portions of District 9 and thereby increasing the functional contiguity. The Court's other criticism, that moving all of Precinct 77 into District 12 would not work, is simply a red herring. Dr. Weber talked only of moving all of Precinct 77 into District 9, not of moving all of Precinct 77 into District 12.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn7"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn7_ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Of course, considering that District 12 has never been constitutionally drawn, Dr. Weber's criticism-that the problem with the district lies not just at its edges, but at its core-is not without force.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn8"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn8_ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The court also relied on the statement of legislative redistricting leader Senator Cooper to the North Carolina Legislature, see App. to Juris. Statement in No. 99-1864, p. 27a, in which the senator mentioned the goals of geographical, political, and racial balance, App. 460. In isolation, this statement does appear to support only the finding that race was a motive. Unlike this Court, however, the District Court had the advantage of listening to and watching Senator Cooper testify. I therefore am in no position to question the court's likely analysis that, although Senator Cooper mentioned all three motives, the predominance of race was apparent. This determination was made all the more reasonable by the fact that the District Court found the senator's claim regarding the "happenstance" final composition of the district to lack credibility in light of the e-mail. App. to Juris. Statement in No. 99-1864, p. 28a, n. 8.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*413&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*413&lt;/span&gt; Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justice Ginsburg, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Kiowa Tribe of Okla.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Manufacturing Technologies, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 523 U. S. 751 (1998), this Court held that an Indian tribe is not subject to suit in a state court&#151;even for breach of contract involving off-reservation commercial conduct&#151;unless "Congress has authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its immunity." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 754. This case concerns the impact of an arbitration agreement on a tribe's plea of suit immunity. The document on which the case centers is a standard form construction contract signed by the parties to govern the installation of a foam roof on a building, the First Oklahoma Bank, in Shawnee, Oklahoma. The building and land are owned by an Indian Tribe, the Citizen Potawatomi Nation (Tribe). The building is commercial, and the land is off-reservation, nontrust property. The form contract, which was proposed by the Tribe and accepted by the contractor, C &amp;amp; L Enterprises, Inc. (C &amp;amp; L), contains an arbitration clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question presented is whether the Tribe waived its immunity from suit in state court when it expressly agreed to arbitrate disputes with C &amp;amp; L relating to the contract, to the governance of Oklahoma law, and to the enforcement of arbitral awards "in any court having jurisdiction thereof." We hold that, by the clear import of the arbitration clause, the Tribe is amenable to a state-court suit to enforce an arbitral award in favor of contractor C &amp;amp; L.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent Citizen Potawatomi Nation is a federally recognized Indian Tribe. In 1993, it entered into a contract with petitioner C &amp;amp; L for the installation of a roof on a Shawnee, Oklahoma, building owned by the Tribe. The building, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*415&lt;/span&gt; which housed the First Oklahoma Bank, is not on the Tribe's reservation or on land held by the Federal Government in trust for the Tribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract at issue is a standard form agreement copyrighted by the American Institute of Architects. The Tribe proposed the contract; details not set out in the form were inserted by the Tribe and its architect. Two provisions of the contract are key to this case. First, the contract contains an arbitration clause:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"All claims or disputes between the Contractor [C &amp;amp; L] and the Owner [the Tribe] arising out of or relating to the Contract, or the breach thereof, shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with the Construction [I]ndustry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association currently in effect unless the parties mutually agree otherwise . . . . The award rendered by the arbitrator or arbitrators shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof." App. to Pet. for Cert. 46.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Arbitration Association Rules to which the clause refers provide: "Parties to these rules shall be deemed to have consented that judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered in any federal or state court having jurisdiction thereof." American Arbitration Association, Construction Industry Dispute Resolution Procedures, R-48(c) (Sept. 1, 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the contract includes a choice-of-law clause that reads: "The contract shall be governed by the law of the place where the Project is located." App. to Pet. for Cert. 56. Oklahoma has adopted a Uniform Arbitration Act, which instructs that "[t]he making of an agreement . . . providing for arbitration in this state confers jurisdiction on the court to enforce the agreement under this act and to enter judgment on an award thereunder." Okla. Stat., Tit. 15, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*416&lt;/span&gt; &#167; 802.B (1993). The Act defines "court" as "any court of competent jurisdiction of this state." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After execution of the contract but before C &amp;amp; L commenced performance, the Tribe decided to change the roofing material from foam (the material specified in the contract) to rubber guard. The Tribe solicited new bids and retained another company to install the roof. C &amp;amp; L, claiming that the Tribe had dishonored the contract, submitted an arbitration demand. The Tribe asserted sovereign immunity and declined to participate in the arbitration proceeding. It notified the arbitrator, however, that it had several substantive defenses to C &amp;amp; L's claim. On consideration of C &amp;amp; L's evidence, the arbitrator rendered an award in favor of C &amp;amp; L for $25,400 in damages (close to 30% of the contract price), plus attorney's fees and costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several weeks later, C &amp;amp; L filed suit to enforce the arbitration award in the District Court of Oklahoma County, a state court of general, first instance, jurisdiction. The Tribe appeared specially for the limited purpose of moving to dismiss the action on the ground that the Tribe was immune from suit. The District Court denied the motion and entered a judgment confirming the award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals affirmed, holding that the Tribe lacked immunity because the contract giving rise to the suit was "between an Indian tribe and a nonIndian" and was "executed outside of Indian Country." App. to Pet. for Cert. 14 (citation omitted). The Oklahoma Supreme Court denied review, and the Tribe petitioned for certiorari in this Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Tribe's petition was pending here, the Court decided &lt;i&gt;Kiowa,&lt;/i&gt; holding: "Tribes enjoy immunity from suits on contracts, whether those contracts involve governmental or commercial activities and whether they were made on or off a reservation." 523 U. S., at 760. &lt;i&gt;Kiowa&lt;/i&gt; reconfirmed: "[A]n Indian tribe is subject to suit only where Congress has authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its immunity." &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*417&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 754. Thereafter, we granted the Tribe's petition in this case, vacated the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals, and remanded for reconsideration in light of &lt;i&gt;Kiowa.&lt;/i&gt;  524 U. S. 901 (1998).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On remand, the Court of Civil Appeals changed course. It held that, under &lt;i&gt;Kiowa,&lt;/i&gt; the Tribe here was immune from suit on its contract with C &amp;amp; L, despite the contract's offreservation subject matter. App. to Pet. for Cert. 4-5. The court then addressed whether the Tribe had waived its immunity. "The agreement of [the] Tribe to arbitration, and the contract language regarding enforcement in courts having jurisdiction," the court observed, "seem to indicate a willingness on [the] Tribe's part to expose itself to suit on the contract." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 7. But, the court quickly added, "the leap from that willingness to a waiver of immunity is one based on implication, not an unequivocal expression." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt;  Concluding that the Tribe had not waived its suit immunity with the requisite clarity, the appeals court instructed the trial court to dismiss the case. The Oklahoma Supreme Court denied C &amp;amp; L's petition for review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflicting with the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals' current decision, several state and federal courts have held that an arbitration clause, kin to the one now before us, expressly waives tribal immunity from a suit arising out of the contract. See &lt;i&gt;Sokaogon Gaming Enterprise Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;TushieMontgomery Associates, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 86 F. 3d 656, 661 (CA7 1996) (clause requiring arbitration of contractual disputes and authorizing entry of judgment upon arbitral award "in any court having jurisdiction thereof" expressly waived Tribe's immunity); &lt;i&gt;Native Village of Eyak&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;GC Contractors,&lt;/i&gt; 658 P. 2d 756 (Alaska 1983) (same); &lt;i&gt;Val/Del, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Superior Court,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/arizctapp/7XXR/valdel-inc-v-superior-court/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;145&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ariz.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;558&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 703 P. 2d 502 (Ct. App. 1985) (same). But cf. &lt;i&gt;Pan American Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sycuan Band of Mission Indians,&lt;/i&gt; 884 F. 2d 416 (CA9 1989) (clause requiring arbitration of contractual disputes did not expressly waive Tribe's immunity). &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*418&lt;/span&gt; We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict, 531 U. S. 956 (2000), and now reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kiowa,&lt;/i&gt; in which we reaffirmed the doctrine of tribal immunity, involved an off-reservation, commercial agreement (a stock purchase) by a federally recognized Tribe. The Tribe signed a promissory note agreeing to pay the seller $285,000 plus interest. The note recited: "Nothing in this Note subjects or limits the sovereign rights of the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma." 523 U. S., at 753-754. The Tribe defaulted, the seller sued on the note in state court, and the Tribe asserted sovereign immunity. We upheld the plea. Tribal immunity, we ruled in &lt;i&gt;Kiowa,&lt;/i&gt; extends to suits on offreservation commercial contracts. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 754-760. The Kiowa Tribe was immune from suit for defaulting on the promissory note, we held, because "Congress ha[d] not abrogated [the Tribe's] immunity, nor ha[d] petitioner waived it." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 760.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;i&gt;Kiowa,&lt;/i&gt; this case arises out of the breach of a commercial, off-reservation contract by a federally recognized Indian Tribe. The petitioning contractor, C &amp;amp; L, does not contend that Congress has abrogated tribal immunity in this setting. The question presented is whether the Tribe has waived its immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To abrogate tribal immunity, Congress must "unequivocally" express that purpose. &lt;i&gt;Santa Clara Pueblo&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Martinez,&lt;/i&gt; 436 U. S. 49, 58 (1978) (citing &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Testan,&lt;/i&gt;  424 U. S. 392, 399 (1976)). Similarly, to relinquish itsimmunity, a tribe's waiver must be "clear." &lt;i&gt;Oklahoma Tax Comm'n&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Okla.,&lt;/i&gt; 498 U. S. 505, 509 (1991). We are satisfied that the Tribe in this case has waived, with the requisite clarity, immunity from the suit C &amp;amp; L brought to enforce its arbitration award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction contract's provision for arbitration and related prescriptions lead us to this conclusion. The arbitration &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*419&lt;/span&gt; clause requires resolution of all contract-related disputes between C &amp;amp; L and the Tribe by binding arbitration; ensuing arbitral awards may be reduced to judgment "in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof." App. to Pet. for Cert. 46. For governance of arbitral proceedings, the arbitration clause specifies American Arbitration Association Rules for the construction industry, &lt;i&gt;ibid.,&lt;/i&gt; and under those Rules, "the arbitration award may be entered in any federal or state court having jurisdiction thereof," American Arbitration Association, Construction Industry Dispute Resolution Procedures, R-48(c) (Sept. 1, 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract's choice-of-law clause makes it plain enough that a "court having jurisdiction" to enforce the award in question is the Oklahoma state court in which C &amp;amp; L filed suit. By selecting Oklahoma law ("the law of the place where the Project is located") to govern the contract, App. to Pet. for Cert. 56, the parties have effectively consented to confirmation of the award "in accordance with" the Oklahoma Uniform Arbitration Act, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 46 ("judgment may be entered upon [the arbitration award] in accordance with applicable law"); Okla. Stat., Tit. 15, &#167; 802.A (1993) ("This act shall apply to . . . a provision in a written contract to submit to arbitration any controversy thereafter arising between the parties.").&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Uniform Act in force in Oklahoma prescribes that, when "an agreement . . . provid[es] for arbitration in this state," &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; in Oklahoma, jurisdiction to enforce the agreement vests in "any court of competent jurisdiction of this &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*420&lt;/span&gt; state." &#167; 802.B. On any sensible reading of the Act, the District Court of Oklahoma County, a local court of general jurisdiction, fits that statutory description.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, the Tribe agreed, by express contract, to adhere to certain dispute resolution procedures. In fact, the Tribe itself tendered the contract calling for those procedures. The regime to which the Tribe subscribed includes entry of judgment upon an arbitration award in accordance with the Oklahoma Uniform Arbitration Act. That Act concerns arbitration in Oklahoma and correspondingly designates as enforcement forums "court[s] of competent jurisdiction of [Oklahoma]." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; C &amp;amp; L selected for its enforcement suit just such a forum. In a case involving an arbitration clause essentially indistinguishable from the one to which the Tribe and C &amp;amp; L agreed, the Seventh Circuit stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is nothing ambiguous about th[e] language [of the arbitration clause]. The tribe agrees to submit disputes arising under the contract to arbitration, to be bound by the arbitration award, and to have its submission and the award enforced in a court of law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;. . . "The [tribal immunity] waiver . . . is implicit rather than explicit only if a waiver of sovereign immunity, to be deemed explicit, must use the words `sovereign immunity.' No case has ever held that." &lt;i&gt;Sokaogon,&lt;/i&gt; 86 F. 3d, at 659-660. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*421&lt;/span&gt; That cogent observation holds as well for the case we confront.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tribe strenuously urges, however, that an arbitration clause simply "is not a waiver of immunity from suit." Brief for Respondent 13. The phrase in the clause providing for enforcement of arbitration awards "in any court having jurisdiction thereof," the Tribe maintains, "begs the question of what court has jurisdiction." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 22. As counsel for the Tribe clarified at oral argument, the Tribe's answer is "no court," on earth or even on the moon. Tr. of Oral Arg. 32-33. No court&#151;federal, state, or even tribal&#151;has jurisdiction over C &amp;amp; L's suit, the Tribe insists, because it has not expressly waived its sovereign immunity in any judicial forum. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.;&lt;/i&gt; cf. &lt;i&gt;Sokaogon,&lt;/i&gt; 86 F. 3d, at 660 (facing a similar argument, Seventh Circuit gleaned that counsel meant only a statement to this effect will do: "The tribe will not assert the defense of sovereign immunity if sued for breach of contract.").&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*422&lt;/span&gt; Instead of waiving suit immunity in any court, the Tribe argues, the arbitration clause waives simply and only the parties' rights to a court trial of contractual disputes; under the clause, the Tribe recognizes, the parties must instead arbitrate. Brief for Respondent 21 ("An arbitration clause is what it is: a clause submitting contractual disputes to arbitration."). The clause no doubt memorializes the Tribe's commitment to adhere to the contract's dispute resolution regime. That regime has a real world objective; it is not designed for regulation of a game lacking practical consequences. And to the real world end, the contract specifically authorizes judicial enforcement of the resolution arrived at through arbitration. See &lt;i&gt;Eyak,&lt;/i&gt; 658 P. 2d, at 760 ("[W]e believe it is clear that any dispute arising from a contract cannot be resolved by arbitration, as specified in the contract, if one of the parties intends to assert the defense of sovereign immunity. . . . The arbitration clause . . . would be meaningless if it did not constitute a waiver of whatever immunity [the Tribe] possessed."); &lt;i&gt;Val/Del,&lt;/i&gt; 145 Ariz., at 565, 703 P. 2d, at 509 (because the Tribe has "agree[d] that any dispute would be arbitrated and the result entered as a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction, we find that there was an express waiver of the tribe's sovereign immunity"); cf. &lt;i&gt;Rosebud Sioux Tribe&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Val-U Constr. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 50 F. 3d 560, 562 (CA8 1995) (agreement to arbitrate contractual disputes did not contain provision for court enforcement; court nonetheless observed that "disputes could not be resolved by arbitration if one party intended to assert sovereign immunity as a defense").&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*423&lt;/span&gt; The Tribe also asserts that a form contract, designed principally for private parties who have no immunity to waive, cannot establish a clear waiver of tribal suit immunity. Brief for Respondent 20; Tr. of Oral Arg. 27-28. In appropriate cases, we apply "the common-law rule of contract interpretation that a court should construe ambiguous language against the interest of the party that drafted it." &lt;i&gt;Mastrobuono&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S. 52, 62 (1995) (construing form contract containing arbitration clause). That rule, however, is in apposite here. The contract, as we have explained, is not ambiguous. Nor did the Tribe find itself holding the short end of an adhesion contract stick: The Tribe proposed and prepared the contract; C &amp;amp; L foisted no form on a quiescent Tribe. Cf. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bankers Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 245 F. 3d 315, 319-320 (CA4 2001) (where federal agency prepared agreement, including its arbitration provision, sovereign immunity does not shield the agency from engaging in the arbitration process).&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the reasons stated, we conclude that under the agreement the Tribe proposed and signed, the Tribe clearly consented to arbitration and to the enforcement of arbitral awards in Oklahoma state court; the Tribe thereby waived its sovereign immunity from C &amp;amp; L's suit. The judgment of the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The United States, as &lt;i&gt;amicus&lt;/i&gt; supporting the Tribe, urges us to remain within the "four corners of the contract" and refrain from reliance on "secondary sources." Brief for United States as &lt;i&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 19, and n. 7. The American Arbitration Association Rules and the Uniform Arbitration Act, however, are not secondary interpretive aides that supplement our reading of the contract; they are prescriptions incorporated by the express terms of the agreement itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The United States argues that the Oklahoma Uniform Arbitration Act is inapplicable in this case because it does not reach all arbitrations properly held in Oklahoma, but only those in which the agreement explicitly "provide[s] for arbitration in [Oklahoma]." Tr. of Oral Arg. 47-48 (referring to &#167; 802.B). No Oklahoma authority is cited for this constricted reading of an Act that expressly "appl[ies] to . . . aprovision in a written contract to submit to arbitration any controversy thereafter arising between the parties." &#167; 802.A. We decline to attribute to the Oklahoma lawmakers and interpreters a construction that so severely shrinks the Act's domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Instructive here is the law governing waivers of immunity by foreign sovereigns. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Kiowa Tribe of Okla.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Manufacturing Technologies, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 523 U. S. 751, 759 (1998) ("In considering Congress' role in reforming tribal immunity, we find instructive the problems of sovereign immunity for foreign countries."). "Under the law of the United States . . . an agreement to arbitrate is a waiver of immunity from jurisdiction in. . . an action to enforce an arbitral award rendered pursuant to the agreement . . . ." Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States &#167; 456(2)(b)(ii) (1987).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Relying on our state sovereign immunity jurisprudence, the United States maintains that "courts must be especially reluctant to construe ambiguous expressions as consent by a Tribe to be sued in state court." Brief for United States as &lt;i&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 23; see also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 25 (arguing that a State's generalized consent to suit, without an express selection of the forum in which suit may proceed, "should be construed narrowly as the State's consent to be sued in its &lt;i&gt;own&lt;/i&gt; courts of competent jurisdiction, and not its consent to be subjected to suits in &lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt; sovereign's courts") (citing, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kennecott Copper Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State Tax Comm'n,&lt;/i&gt; 327 U. S. 573 (1946) (State statute authorizing suits against State in "any court of competent jurisdiction" did not waive State's immunity from suit in federal court)). But in this case, as we explained &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 419-420, the Tribe has plainly consented to suit in Oklahoma state court. We therefore have no occasion to decide whether parallel principles govern state and tribal waivers of immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  The Tribe's apparent concession&#151;that the arbitration clause embodies the parties' agreement to resolve disputes through arbitration&#151;is not altogether consistent with the Tribe's refusal to participate in the arbitration proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  The Tribe alternatively urges affirmance on the grounds that the contract is void under 25 U. S. C. &#167; 81 and that the members of the Tribe who executed the contract lacked the authority to do so on the Tribe's behalf. These issues were not aired in the Oklahoma courts and are not within the scope of the questions on which we granted review. We therefore decline to address them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;No. 99-6218.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;United States Supreme Court.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued November 1, 2000.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided May 14, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF TENNESSEE
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*453&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*453&lt;/span&gt; O'Connor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Kennedy, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined. Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 467. Scalia, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens and Thomas, JJ., joined, and in which Breyer, J., joined as to Part II, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 467. Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 481.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;W. Mark Ward&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Tony Brayton&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Garland Erg&#252;den.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Michael E. Moore,&lt;/i&gt; Solicitor General of Tennessee, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Paul G. Summers,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;Gordon W. Smith,&lt;/i&gt; Associate Solicitor General.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice O'Connor, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case concerns the constitutionality of the retroactive application of a judicial decision abolishing the common law "year and a day rule." At common law, the year and a day rule provided that no defendant could be convicted of murder unless his victim had died by the defendant's act within a year and a day of the act. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Louisville, E. &amp;amp; St. L. R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Clarke,&lt;/i&gt; 152 U. S. 230, 239 (1894); 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 197-198 (1769). The Supreme Court of Tennessee abolished the rule as it had existed at common law in Tennessee and applied its decision to petitioner to uphold his conviction. The question before us is whether, in doing so, the court denied petitioner due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*454&lt;/span&gt; I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner Wilbert K. Rogers was convicted in Tennessee state court of second degree murder. According to the undisputed facts, petitioner stabbed his victim, James Bowdery, with a butcher knife on May 6, 1994. One of the stab wounds penetrated Bowdery's heart. During surgery to repair the wound to his heart, Bowdery went into cardiac arrest, but was resuscitated and survived the procedure. As a result, however, he had developed a condition known as "cerebral hypoxia," which results from a loss of oxygen to the brain. Bowdery's higher brain functions had ceased, and he slipped into and remained in a coma until August 7, 1995, when he died from a kidney infection (a common complication experienced by comatose patients). Approximately 15 months had passed between the stabbing and Bowdery's death which, according to the undisputed testimony of the county medical examiner, was caused by cerebral hypoxia "`secondary to a stab wound to the heart.' " 992 S. W. 2d 393, 395 (Tenn. 1999).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this evidence, the jury found petitioner guilty under Tennessee's criminal homicide statute. The statute, which makes no mention of the year and a day rule, defines criminal homicide simply as "the unlawful killing of another person which may be first degree murder, second degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide or vehicular homicide." Tenn. Code Ann. &#167; 39-13-201 (1997). Petitioner appealed his conviction to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, arguing that, despite its absence from the statute, the year and a day rule persisted as part of the common law of Tennessee and, as such, precluded his conviction. The Court of Criminal Appeals rejected that argument and affirmed the conviction. The court held that Tennessee's Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989 (1989 Act), which abolished all common law defenses in criminal actions in Tennessee, had abolished the rule. See Tenn. Code Ann. &#167; 39-11-203(e)(2) (1997). The court also rejected &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*455&lt;/span&gt; petitioner's further contention that the legislative abolition of the rule constituted an &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; violation, noting that the 1989 Act had taken effect five years before petitioner committed his crime. No. 02C01-9611&#151;CR-00418 (Tenn. Crim. App., Oct. 17, 1997), App. 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court of Tennessee affirmed on different grounds. The court observed that it had recognized the viability of the year and a day rule in Tennessee in &lt;i&gt;Percer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;118&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Tenn.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;765&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 103 S. W. 780 (1907), and that, "[d]espite the paucity of case law" on the rule in Tennessee, "both parties . . . agree that the . . . rule was a part of the common law of this State." 992 S. W. 2d, at 396. Turning to the rule's present status, the court noted that the rule has been legislatively or judicially abolished by the "vast majority" of jurisdictions recently to have considered the issue. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 397. The court concluded that, contrary to the conclusion of the Court of Criminal Appeals, the 1989 Act had not abolished the rule. After reviewing the justifications for the rule at common law, however, the court found that the original reasons for recognizing the rule no longer exist. Accordingly, the court abolished the rule as it had existed at common law in Tennessee. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 399-401.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court disagreed with petitioner's contention that application of its decision abolishing the rule to his case would violate the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions. Those constitutional provisions, the court observed, refer only to legislative Acts. The court then noted that in &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;City of Columbia,&lt;/i&gt; 378 U. S. 347 (1964), this Court held that due process prohibits retroactive application of any "`judicial construction of a criminal statute [that] is unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which has been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.' " 992 S. W. 2d, at 402 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;City of Columbia, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 354) (alteration in original). The court concluded, however, that application of its decision to petitioner would &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*456&lt;/span&gt; not offend this principle. 992 S. W. 2d, at 402. We granted certiorari, 529 U. S. 1129 (2000), and we now affirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although petitioner's claim is one of due process, the Constitution's &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause figures prominently in his argument. The Clause provides simply that "[n]o State shall . . . pass any . . . ex post facto Law." Art. I, &#167; 10, cl. 1. The most well-known and oft-repeated explanation of the scope of the Clause's protection was given by Justice Chase, who long ago identified, in dictum, four types of laws to which the Clause extends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"1st. Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed. 3d. Every law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offense, in order to convict the offender." &lt;i&gt;Calder&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bull,&lt;/i&gt; 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798) (&lt;i&gt;seriatim&lt;/i&gt; opinion of Chase, J.) (emphasis deleted).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accord, &lt;i&gt;Carmell&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Texas,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S. 513, 521-525 (2000); &lt;i&gt;Collins&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Youngblood,&lt;/i&gt; 497 U. S. 37, 41-42, 46 (1990). As the text of the Clause makes clear, it "is a limitation upon the powers of the Legislature, and does not of its own force apply to the Judicial Branch of government." &lt;i&gt;Marks&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 430 U. S. 188, 191 (1977) (citation omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have observed, however, that limitations on &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; judicial decision making are inherent in the notion of due process. In &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;City of Columbia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; we considered the South Carolina Supreme Court's retroactive application &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*457&lt;/span&gt; of its construction of the State's criminal trespass statute to the petitioners in that case. The statute prohibited "entry upon the lands of another . . . after notice from the owner or tenant prohibiting such entry . . . ." 378 U. S., at 349, n. 1 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The South Carolina court construed the statute to extend to patrons of a drug store who had received no notice prohibiting their entry into the store, but had refused to leave the store when asked. Prior to the court's decision, South Carolina cases construing the statute had uniformly held that conviction under the statute required proof of notice before entry. None of those cases, moreover, had given the "slightest indication that that requirement could be satisfied by proof of the different act of remaining on the land after being told to leave." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 357.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We held that the South Carolina court's retroactive application of its construction to the store patrons violated due process. Reviewing decisions in which we had held criminal statutes "void for vagueness" under the Due Process Clause, we noted that this Court has often recognized the "basic principle that a criminal statute must give fair warning of the conduct that it makes a crime." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 350; see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 350-352 (discussing, &lt;i&gt;inter alia, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Harriss,&lt;/i&gt; 347 U. S. 612 (1954), &lt;i&gt;Lanzetta&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New Jersey,&lt;/i&gt; 306 U. S. 451 (1939), and &lt;i&gt;Connally&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;General Constr. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 269 U. S. 385 (1926)). Deprivation of the right to fair warning, we continued, can result both from vague statutory language and from an unforeseeable and retroactive judicial expansion of statutory language that appears narrow and precise on its face. &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;City of Columbia,&lt;/i&gt; 378 U. S., at 352. For that reason, we concluded that "[i]f a judicial construction of a criminal statute is `unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue,' [the construction] must not be given retroactive effect." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 354 (quoting J. Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law 61 (2d ed. 1960)). We found that the South &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*458&lt;/span&gt; Carolina court's construction of the statute violated this principle because it was so clearly at odds with the statute's plain language and had no support in prior South Carolina decisions. 378 U. S., at 356.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relying largely upon &lt;i&gt;Bouie,&lt;/i&gt; petitioner argues that the Tennessee court erred in rejecting his claim that the retroactive application of its decision to his case violates due process. Petitioner contends that the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause would prohibit the retroactive application of a decision abolishing the year and a day rule if accomplished by the Tennessee Legislature. He claims that the purposes behind the Clause are so fundamental that due process should prevent the Supreme Court of Tennessee from accomplishing the same result by judicial decree. Brief for Petitioner 8-18. In support of this claim, petitioner takes &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; to stand for the proposition that "[i]n evaluating whether the retroactive application of a judicial decree violates Due Process, a critical question is whether the Constitution would prohibit the same result attained by the exercise of the state's legislative power." Brief for Petitioner 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the extent petitioner argues that the Due Process Clause incorporates the specific prohibitions of the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause as identified in &lt;i&gt;Calder,&lt;/i&gt; petitioner misreads &lt;i&gt;Bouie.&lt;/i&gt; To be sure, our opinion in &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; does contain some expansive language that is suggestive of the broad interpretation for which petitioner argues. Most prominent is our statement that "[i]f a state legislature is barred by the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause from passing . . . a law, it must follow that a State Supreme Court is barred by the Due Process Clause from achieving precisely the same result by judicial construction." 378 U. S., at 353-354; see also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 353 ("[A]n unforeseeable judicial enlargement of a criminal statute, applied retroactively, operates precisely like an &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; law"); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 362 ("The Due Process Clause compels the same result" as would the constitutional proscription against &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; laws "where the State has sought to achieve &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*459&lt;/span&gt; precisely the same [impermissible] effect by judicial construction of the statute"). This language, however, was dicta. Our decision in &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; was rooted firmly in well established notions of &lt;i&gt;due process.&lt;/i&gt; See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 457-458. Its rationale rested on core due process concepts of notice, foreseeability, and, in particular, the right to fair warning as those concepts bear on the constitutionality of attaching criminal penalties to what previously had been innocent conduct. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 378 U. S., at 351, 352, 354-355. And we couched its holding squarely in terms of that established due process right, and not in terms of the &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; related dicta to which petitioner points. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 355 (concluding that "the South Carolina Code did not give [the petitioners] fair warning, at the time of their conduct . . . , that the act for which they now stand convicted was rendered criminal by the statute"). Contrary to petitioner's suggestion, nowhere in the opinion did we go so far as to incorporate jot-for-jot the specific categories of &lt;i&gt;Calder&lt;/i&gt; into due process limitations on the retroactive application of judicial decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor have any of our subsequent decisions addressing &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; -type claims interpreted &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; as extending so far. Those decisions instead have uniformly viewed &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; as restricted to its traditional due process roots. In doing so, they have applied &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; `s check on retroactive judicial decision making not by reference to the &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; categories set out in &lt;i&gt;Calder,&lt;/i&gt; but, rather, in accordance with the more basic and general principle of fair warning that &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; so clearly articulated. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lanier,&lt;/i&gt; 520 U. S. 259, 266 (1997) ("[D]ue process bars courts from applying a novel construction of a criminal statute to conduct that neither the statute nor any prior judicial decision has fairly disclosed to be within its scope"); &lt;i&gt;Marks&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt;  430 U. S., at 191-192 (Due process protects against judicial infringement of the "right to fair warning" that certain conduct will give rise to criminal penalties); &lt;i&gt;Rose&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Locke,&lt;/i&gt; 423 U. S. 48, 53 (1975) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; (upholding defendant's conviction &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*460&lt;/span&gt; under statute prohibiting "crimes against nature" because, unlike in &lt;i&gt;Bouie,&lt;/i&gt; the defendant "[could] make no claim that [the statute] afforded no notice that his conduct might be within its scope"); &lt;i&gt;Douglas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Buder,&lt;/i&gt; 412 U. S. 430, 432 (1973) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; (trial court's construction of the term "arrest" as including a traffic citation, and application of that construction to defendant to revoke his probation, was unforeseeable and thus violated due process); &lt;i&gt;Rabe&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Washington,&lt;/i&gt; 405 U. S. 313, 316 (1972) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; (reversing conviction under state obscenity law because it did "not giv[e] fair notice" that the location of the allegedly obscene exhibition was a vital element of the offense).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner observes that the Due Process and &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clauses safeguard common interests&#151;in particular, the interests in fundamental fairness (through notice and fair warning) and the prevention of the arbitrary and vindictive use of the laws. Brief for Petitioner 12-18. While this is undoubtedly correct, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lynce&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mathis,&lt;/i&gt; 519 U. S. 433, 439-440, and n. 12 (1997), petitioner is mistaken to suggest that these considerations compel extending the strictures of the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause to the context of common law judging. The &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause, by its own terms, does not apply to courts. Extending the Clause to courts through the rubric of due process thus would circumvent the clear constitutional text. It also would evince too little regard for the important institutional and contextual differences between legislating, on the one hand, and common law decisionmaking, on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner contends that state courts acting in their common law capacity act much like legislatures in the exercise of their lawmaking function, and indeed may in some cases even be subject to the same kinds of political influences and pressures that justify &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; limitations upon legislatures. Brief for Petitioner 12-18; Reply Brief for Petitioner 15. A court's "opportunity for discrimination," however, "is more limited than [a] legislature's, in that [it] can only act &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*461&lt;/span&gt; in construing existing law in actual litigation." &lt;i&gt;James&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 366 U. S. 213, 247, n. 3 (1961) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Moreover, "[g]iven the divergent pulls of flexibility and precedent in our case law system," &lt;i&gt;ibid.,&lt;/i&gt; incorporation of the &lt;i&gt;Calder&lt;/i&gt; categories into due process limitations on judicial decision making would place an unworkable and unacceptable restraint on normal judicial processes and would be incompatible with the resolution of uncertainty that marks any evolving legal system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is particularly so where, as here, the allegedly impermissible judicial application of a rule of law involves not the interpretation of a statute but an act of common law judging. In the context of common law doctrines (such as the year and a day rule), there often arises a need to clarify or even to reevaluate prior opinions as new circumstances and fact patterns present themselves. Such judicial acts, whether they be characterized as "making" or "finding" the law, are a necessary part of the judicial business in States in which the criminal law retains some of its common law elements. Strict application of &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; principles in that context would unduly impair the incremental and reasoned development of precedent that is the foundation of the common law system. The common law, in short, presupposes a measure of evolution that is incompatible with stringent application of &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; principles. It was on account of concerns such as these that &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; restricted due process limitations on the retroactive application of judicial interpretations of criminal statutes to those that are "unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue." &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;City of Columbia,&lt;/i&gt; 378 U. S., at 354 (internal quotation marks omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe this limitation adequately serves the common law context as well. It accords common law courts the substantial leeway they must enjoy as they engage in the daily task of formulating and passing upon criminal defenses and interpreting such doctrines as causation and intent, reevaluating &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*462&lt;/span&gt; and refining them as may be necessary to bring the common law into conformity with logic and common sense. It also adequately respects the due process concern with fundamental fairness and protects against vindictive or arbitrary judicial lawmaking by safeguarding defendants against unjustified and unpredictable breaks with prior law. Accordingly, we conclude that a judicial alteration of a common law doctrine of criminal law violates the principle of fair warning, and hence must not be given retroactive effect, only where it is "unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Scalia makes much of the fact that, at the time of the framing of the Constitution, it was widely accepted that courts could not "change" the law, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 472-473, 477-478 (dissenting opinion), and that (according to Justice Scalia) there is no doubt that the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause would have prohibited a legislative decision identical to the Tennessee court's decision here, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 469-471, 478. This latter argument seeks at bottom merely to reopen what has long been settled by the constitutional text and our own decisions: that the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause does not apply to judicial decision making. The former argument is beside the point. Common law courts at the time of the framing undoubtedly believed that they were finding rather than making law. But, however one characterizes their actions, the fact of the matter is that common law courts then, as now, were deciding cases, and in doing so were fashioning and refining the law as it then existed in light of reason and experience. Due process clearly did not prohibit this process of judicial evolution at the time of the framing, and it does not do so today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning to the particular facts of the instant case, the Tennessee court's abolition of the year and a day rule was not unexpected and indefensible. The year and a day rule is widely viewed as an outdated relic of the common law. Petitioner &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*463&lt;/span&gt; does not even so much as hint that good reasons exist for retaining the rule, and so we need not delve too deeply into the rule and its history here. Suffice it to say that the rule is generally believed to date back to the 13th century, when it served as a statute of limitations governing the time in which an individual might initiate a private action for murder known as an "appeal of death"; that by the 18th century the rule had been extended to the law governing public prosecutions for murder; that the primary and most frequently cited justification for the rule is that 13th century medical science was incapable of establishing causation beyond a reasonable doubt when a great deal of time had elapsed between the injury to the victim and his death; and that, as practically every court recently to have considered the rule has noted, advances in medical and related science have so undermined the usefulness of the rule as to render it without question obsolete. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Carrillo,&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ill/cpxA/people-v-carrillo/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;164&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ill. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;144&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 150, 646 N. E. 2d 582, 585 (1995); &lt;i&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lewis,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/mass/bH2F/commonwealth-v-lewis/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;381&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Mass.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;411&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 414-415, 409 N. E. 2d 771, 772-773 (1980); &lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Stevenson,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/mich/9gLD/people-v-stevenson/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;416&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Mich.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;383&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 391-392, 331 N. W. 2d 143, 146 (1982); &lt;i&gt;State&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hefler,&lt;/i&gt; 310 N. C. 135, 138-140, 310 S. E. 2d 310, 313 (1984); see generally Comment, 59 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1337 (1992) (tracing the history of the rule).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, the year and a day rule has been legislatively or judicially abolished in the vast majority of jurisdictions recently to have addressed the issue. See 992 S. W. 2d, at 397, n. 4 (reviewing cases and statutes). Citing &lt;i&gt;Bouie,&lt;/i&gt;  petitioner contends that the judicial abolition of the rule in other jurisdictions is irrelevant to whether he had fair warning that the rule in Tennessee might similarly be abolished and, hence, to whether the Tennessee court's decision was unexpected and indefensible as applied to him. Brief for Petitioner 28-30. In discussing the apparent meaning of the South Carolina statute in &lt;i&gt;Bouie,&lt;/i&gt; we noted that "[i]t would be a rare situation in which the meaning of a statute of another State sufficed to afford a person `fair warning' that his own &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*464&lt;/span&gt; State's statute meant something quite different from what its words said." 378 U. S., at 359-360. This case, however, involves not the precise meaning of the words of a particular statute, but rather the continuing viability of a common law rule. Common law courts frequently look to the decisions of other jurisdictions in determining whether to alter or modify a common law rule in light of changed circumstances, increased knowledge, and general logic and experience. Due process, of course, does not require a person to apprise himself of the common law of all 50 States in order to guarantee that his actions will not subject him to punishment in light of a developing trend in the law that has not yet made its way to his State. At the same time, however, the fact that a vast number of jurisdictions have abolished a rule that has so clearly outlived its purpose is surely relevant to whether the abolition of the rule in a particular case can be said to be unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law as it then existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and perhaps most importantly, at the time of petitioner's crime the year and a day rule had only the most tenuous foothold as part of the criminal law of the State of Tennessee. The rule did not exist as part of Tennessee's statutory criminal code. And while the Supreme Court of Tennessee concluded that the rule persisted at common law, it also pointedly observed that the rule had never once served as a ground of decision in any prosecution for murder in the State. Indeed, in all the reported Tennessee cases, the rule has been mentioned only three times, and each time in dicta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mention of the rule in Tennessee, and the only mention of it by the Supreme Court of that State, was in 1907 in &lt;i&gt;Percer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;118&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Tenn.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;765&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 103 S. W. 780. In &lt;i&gt;Percer,&lt;/i&gt; the court reversed the defendant's conviction for second degree murder because the defendant was not present in court when the verdict was announced and because the proof failed to show that the murder occurred prior to the finding of the indictment. In discussing the latter ground &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*465&lt;/span&gt; for its decision, the court quoted the rule that "`it is . . . for the State to show that the crime was committed before the indictment was found, and, where it fails to do so, a conviction will be reversed.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 777, 103 S. W., at 783 (quoting 12 Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure 382 (1904)). The court then also quoted the rule that "`[i]n murder, the death must be proven to have taken place within a year and a day from the date of the injury received.' " 118 Tenn., at 777, 103 S. W., at 783 (quoting F. Wharton, Law of Homicide &#167; 18 (3d ed. 1907)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While petitioner relies on this case for the proposition that the year and a day rule was firmly entrenched in the common law of Tennessee, we agree with the Supreme Court of Tennessee that the case cannot establish nearly so much. After reciting the rules just mentioned, the court in &lt;i&gt;Percer&lt;/i&gt; went on to point out that the indictment was found on July 6, 1906; that it charged that the murder was committed sometime in May 1906; and that the only evidence of when the victim died was testimony from a witness stating that he thought the death occurred sometime in July, but specifying neither a date nor a year. From this, the court concluded that it did "not affirmatively appear" from the evidence "whether the death occurred before or after the finding of the indictment." 118 Tenn., at 777, 103 S. W., at 783. The court made no mention of the year and a day rule anywhere in its legal analysis or, for that matter, anywhere else in its opinion. Thus, whatever the import of the court's earlier quoting of the rule, it is clear that the rule did not serve as the basis for the &lt;i&gt;Percer&lt;/i&gt; court's decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next two references to the rule both were by the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals in cases in which the date of the victim's death was not even in issue. Sixty-seven years after &lt;i&gt;Percer,&lt;/i&gt; the court in &lt;i&gt;Cole&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; 512 S. W. 2d 598 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1974), noted the existence of the rule in rejecting the defendants' contentions that insufficient evidence existed to support the jury's conclusion that they had caused the victim's death in a drag-racing crash. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 601. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*466&lt;/span&gt; Twenty-one years after that, in &lt;i&gt;State&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ruane,&lt;/i&gt; 912 S. W. 2d 766 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995), a defendant referred to the rule in arguing that the operative cause of his victim's death was removal of life support rather than a gunshot wound at the defendant's hand. The victim had died within 10 days of receiving the wound. The Court of Criminal Appeals rejected the defendant's argument, concluding, as it had in this case, that the year and a day rule had been abolished by the 1989 Act. It went on to hold that the evidence of causation was sufficient to support the conviction. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 773-777. &lt;i&gt;Ruane,&lt;/i&gt; of course, was decided after petitioner committed his crime, and it concluded that the year and a day rule no longer existed in Tennessee for a reason that the high court of that State ultimately rejected. But we note the case nonetheless to complete our account of the few appearances of the common law rule in the decisions of the Tennessee courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cases hardly suggest that the Tennessee court's decision was "unexpected and indefensible" such that it offended the due process principle of fair warning articulated in &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; and its progeny. This is so despite the fact that, as Justice Scalia correctly points out, the court viewed the year and a day rule as a "substantive principle" of the common law of Tennessee. See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 480. As such, however, it was a principle in name only, having never once been enforced in the State. The Supreme Court of Tennessee also emphasized this fact in its opinion, see 992 S. W. 2d, at 402, and rightly so, for it is surely relevant to whether the court's abolition of the rule in petitioner's case violated due process limitations on retroactive judicial decision making. And while we readily agree with Justice Scalia that fundamental due process prohibits the punishment of conduct that cannot fairly be said to have been criminal at the time the conduct occurred, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., post,&lt;/i&gt; at 470, 478, 480, nothing suggests that is what took place here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, in short, nothing to indicate that the Tennessee court's abolition of the rule in petitioner's case represented &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*467&lt;/span&gt; an exercise of the sort of unfair and arbitrary judicial action against which the Due Process Clause aims to protect. Far from a marked and unpredictable departure from prior precedent, the court's decision was a routine exercise of common law decision making in which the court brought the law into conformity with reason and common sense. It did so by laying to rest an archaic and outdated rule that had never been relied upon as a ground of decision in any reported Tennessee case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Supreme Court of Tennessee is accordingly affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I have joined Justice Scalia's entire dissent, I must add this brief caveat. The perception that commonlaw judges had no power to change the law was unquestionably an important aspect of our judicial heritage in the 17th century but, as he has explained, that perception has played a role of diminishing importance in later years. Whether the most significant changes in that perception occurred before the end of the 18th century or early in the 19th century is, in my judgment, a tangential question that need not be resolved in order to decide this case correctly. For me, far more important than the historical issue is the fact that the majority has undervalued the threat to liberty that is posed whenever the criminal law is changed retroactively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Thomas join, and with whom Justice Breyer joins as to Part II, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court today approves the conviction of a man for a murder that was not murder (but only manslaughter) when the offense was committed. It thus violates a principle&#151; encapsulated in the maxim &lt;i&gt;nulla poena sine lege&lt;/i&gt; &#151;which "dates from the ancient Greeks" and has been described as &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*468&lt;/span&gt; one of the most "widely held value-judgment[s] in the entire history of human thought." J. Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law 59 (2d ed. 1960). Today's opinion produces, moreover, a curious constitution that only a judge could love. One in which (by virtue of the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause) the elected representatives of all the people cannot retroactively make murder what was not murder when the act was committed; but in which unelected judges can do precisely that. One in which the predictability of parliamentary lawmaking cannot validate the retroactive creation of crimes, but the predictability of judicial lawmaking can do so. I do not believe this is the system that the Framers envisioned&#151;or, for that matter, that any reasonable person would imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, let us be clear that the law here was altered after the fact. Petitioner, whatever else he was guilty of, was innocent of murder under the law as it stood at the time of the stabbing, because the victim did not die until after a year and a day had passed. The requisite condition subsequent of the murder victim's death within a year and a day is no different from the requisite condition subsequent of the rape victim's raising a "hue and cry" which we held could not retroactively be eliminated in &lt;i&gt;Carmell&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Texas,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S. 513 (2000). Here, as there, it operates to bar conviction. Indeed, if the present condition differs at all from the one involved in &lt;i&gt;Carmell&lt;/i&gt; it is in the fact that it does not merely pertain to the "quantum of evidence" necessary to corroborate a charge, &lt;i&gt;id.&lt;/i&gt; , at 530, but is an actual &lt;i&gt;element&lt;/i&gt; of the crime&#151;a "substantive principle of law," 992 S. W. 2d 393, 399 (Tenn. 1999), the failure to establish which "entirely precludes a murder prosecution," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 400. Though the Court spends some time questioning whether the year-and-a-day rule was ever truly established in Tennessee, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*469&lt;/span&gt; 464-466, the Supreme Court of Tennessee said it was, see 992 S. W. 2d, at 396, 400, and this reasonable reading of state law by the State's highest court is binding upon us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner's claim is that his conviction violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, insofar as that Clause contains the principle applied against the legislature by the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause of Article I. We first discussed the relationship between these two Clauses in &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;City of Columbia,&lt;/i&gt; 378 U. S. 347 (1964). There, we considered Justice Chase to have spoken for the Court in &lt;i&gt;Calder&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bull,&lt;/i&gt; 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798), when he defined an &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt;  law as, &lt;i&gt;inter alia,&lt;/i&gt; one that "aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed." 378 U. S., at 353 (emphasis deleted). We concluded that, "[i]f a state legislature is barred by the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause from passing such a law, it must follow that a State Supreme Court is barred by the Due Process Clause from achieving precisely the same result by judicial construction." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 353-354. The Court seeks to avoid the obvious import of this language by characterizing it as mere dicta. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 459. Only a concept of dictum that includes the very reasoning of the opinion could support this characterization. The &lt;i&gt;ratio decidendi&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; was that the principle applied to the legislature though the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause was contained in the Due Process Clause insofar as judicial action is concerned. I cannot understand why the Court derives such comfort from the fact that later opinions applying &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; have referred to the Due Process Clause rather than the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 459-460; that is entirely in accord with the rationale of the case, which I follow and which the Court discards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court attempts to cabin &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; by reading it to prohibit only "`unexpected and indefensible' " judicial law revision, and to permit retroactive judicial changes so long as the defendant has had "fair warning" that the changes might occur. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 462. This reading seems plausible because &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*470&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; does indeed use those quoted terms; but they have been wrenched entirely out of context. The "fair warning" to which &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; and subsequent cases referred was not "fair warning that the law might be changed," but fair warning &lt;i&gt;of what constituted the crime at the time of the offense.&lt;/i&gt; And &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; did not express disapproval of "unexpected and indefensible changes in the law" (and thus implicitly approve "expected or defensible changes"). It expressed disapproval of "&lt;i&gt;judicial construction&lt;/i&gt; of a criminal statute" that is "unexpected and indefensible &lt;i&gt;by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.&lt;/i&gt; " 378 U. S., at 354 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). It thus implicitly approved only a judicial construction that was an expected or defensible application of prior cases interpreting the statute. Extending this principle from statutory crimes to common-law crimes would result in the approval of retroactive holdings that accord with prior cases expounding the common law, and the disapproval of retroactive holdings that clearly depart from prior cases expounding the common law. According to &lt;i&gt;Bouie,&lt;/i&gt; not just "unexpected and indefensible" retroactive changes in the common law of crimes are bad, but &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; retroactive changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; rested squarely upon "[t]he fundamental principle that `the required criminal law must have existed when the conduct in issue occurred,' " &lt;i&gt;ibid. (Nulla poena sine lege.)&lt;/i&gt;  Proceeding from that principle, &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; said that "a State Supreme Court is barred by the Due Process Clause from achieving precisely the same result [prohibited by the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause] by judicial construction." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 353&#151; 354. There is no doubt that "fair warning" of the legislature's intent to change the law does not insulate retroactive &lt;i&gt;legislative&lt;/i&gt; criminalization. Such a statute violates the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause, no matter that, at the time the offense was committed, the bill enacting the change was pending and assured of passage&#151;or indeed, had already been passed but not yet signed by the President whose administration had &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*471&lt;/span&gt; proposed it. It follows from the analysis of &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; that "fair warning" of impending change cannot insulate retroactive &lt;i&gt;judicial&lt;/i&gt; criminalization either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor is there any reason in the nature of things why it should. According to the Court, the exception is necessary because prohibiting retroactive judicial criminalization would "place an unworkable and unacceptable restraint on normal judicial processes," would be "incompatible with the resolution of uncertainty that marks any evolving legal system," and would "unduly impair the incremental and reasoned development of precedent that is the foundation of the common law system." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 461. That assessment ignores the crucial difference between simply applying a law to a new set of circumstances and changing the law that has previously been applied to the very circumstances before the court. Many criminal cases present some factual nuance that arguably distinguishes them from cases that have come before; a court applying the penal statute to the new fact pattern does not purport to &lt;i&gt;change&lt;/i&gt; the law. That, however, is not the action before us here, but rather, a square, head-on &lt;i&gt;overruling&lt;/i&gt; of prior law&#151;or, more accurately, something even more extreme than that: a judicial opinion acknowledging that under prior law, for reasons that used to be valid, the accused could not be convicted, but decreeing that, because of changed circumstances, "we hereby abolish the common law rule," 992 S. W. 2d, at 401, and upholding the conviction by applying the new rule to conduct that occurred before the change in law was announced. Even in civil cases, and even in modern times, such retroactive revision of a concededly valid legal rule is extremely rare. With regard to criminal cases, I have no hesitation in affirming that it was unheard of at the time the original Due Process Clause was adopted. As I discuss in detail in the following section, proceeding in that fashion would have been regarded as contrary to the judicial traditions embraced within the concept of due process of law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*472&lt;/span&gt; B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court's opinion considers the judgment at issue here "a routine exercise of common law decision making," whereby the Tennessee court "brought the law into conformity with reason and common sense," by "laying to rest an archaic and outdated rule." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 467. This is an accurate enough description of what modern "common law decision making" consists of&#151;but it is not an accurate description of the theoretical model of common-law decision making accepted by those who adopted the Due Process Clause. At the time of the framing, common-law jurists believed (in the words of Sir Francis Bacon) that the judge's "office is &lt;i&gt;jus dicere,&lt;/i&gt; and not &lt;i&gt;jus dare;&lt;/i&gt; to interpret law, and not to make law, or give law." Bacon, Essays, Civil and Moral, in 3 Harvard Classics 130 (C. Eliot ed. 1909) (1625). Or as described by Blackstone, whose Commentaries were widely read and "accepted [by the framing generation] as the most satisfactory exposition of the common law of England," see &lt;i&gt;Schick&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 195 U. S. 65, 69 (1904), "judicial decisions are the principal and most authoritative &lt;i&gt;evidence,&lt;/i&gt; that can be given, of the existence of such a custom as shall form a part of the common law," 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *69 (hereinafter Blackstone) (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone acknowledged that the courts' exposition of what the law was could change. &lt;i&gt;Stare decisis,&lt;/i&gt; he said, "admits of exception, where the former determination is most evidently contrary to reason . . . ." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; But "in such cases the subsequent judges do not pretend to make a new law, but to vindicate the old one from misrepresentation." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at *70. To fit within this category of bad law, a law must be "manifestly absurd or unjust." It would not suffice, he said, that "the particular reason [for the law] can at this distance of time [not be] precisely assigned." "[F]or though [its] reason be not obvious at first view, yet we owe such a deference to former times as not to suppose they acted &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*473&lt;/span&gt; wholly without consideration." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; By way of example, Blackstone pointed to the seemingly unreasonable rule that one cannot inherit the estate of one's half brother. Though he accepted that the feudal reason behind the law was no longer obvious, he wrote "yet it is not &lt;i&gt;in [a common law judge's] power&lt;/i&gt; to alter it." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at *70&#151;*71 (emphasis added).&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Moreover, "the unreasonableness of a custom in modern circumstances will not affect its validity if the Court is satisfied of a reasonable origin." Allen 140-141. "A custome once reasonable and tolerable, if after it become grievous, and not answerable to the reason, whereupon it was grounded, yet is to be . . . taken away by act of parliament." 2 E. Coke, Institutes of the Laws of England *664 (hereinafter Institutes); see also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at *97 ("No law, or custome of England can be taken away, abrogated, or adnulled, but by authority of parliament"); Of Oaths before an Ecclesiastical Judge Ex Officio, 12 Co. Rep. *26, *29 (1655) ("[T]he law and custom of England is the inheritance of the subject, which he cannot be deprived of without his assent in Parliament").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, stray statements and doctrines found in the historical record that&#151;read out of context&#151;could be thought to support the modern-day proposition that the common &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*474&lt;/span&gt; law was always meant to evolve. Take, for instance, Lord Coke's statement in the Institutes that "the reason of the law ceasing, the law itself ceases." This maxim is often cited by modern devotees of a turbulently changing common law&#151;often in its Latin form &lt;i&gt;(cessante ratione legis, cessat ipse lex)&lt;/i&gt; to create the impression of great venerability. In its original context, however, it had nothing to do with the power of common-law courts to change the law. At the point at which it appears in the Institutes, Coke was discussing the exception granted abbots and mayors from the obligation of military service to the King which attached to land ownership. Such service would be impracticable for a man of the cloth or a mayor. But, said Coke, "if they convey over the lands to any naturall man and his heires," the immunity "by the conveyance over ceaseth." 1 Institutes *70. In other words, the service which attached to the land would apply to any subsequent owner not cloaked in a similar immunity. It was in describing this change that Coke employed the Latin maxim &lt;i&gt;cessante ratione legis, cessat ipse lex.&lt;/i&gt; It had to do, not with a changing of the common-law rule, but with a change of circumstances that rendered the common-law rule no longer applicable to the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true of the similar quotation from Coke: "&lt;i&gt;[R]atio legis est anima legis, et mutata legis ratione, mutatur et lex"&#151;&lt;/i&gt; reason is the soul of the law; the reason of the law being changed, the law is also changed. This is taken from Coke's report of &lt;i&gt;Milborn's Case,&lt;/i&gt; 7 Co. Rep. 6b, 7a (1587), a suit involving a town's responsibility for a murder committed within its precincts. The common-law rule had been that a town could be amerced for failure to apprehend a murderer who committed his crime on its streets during the day, but not a murderer who struck after nightfall, when its citizens were presumably asleep. Parliament, however, enacted a statute requiring towns to close their gates at night, and the court reasoned that thereafter a town that left its gates open could be amerced for the nocturnal homicide &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*475&lt;/span&gt; as well, since the town's violation of the Act was negligence that facilitated the escape. This perhaps partakes more of a new right of action implied from legislation than of any common-law rule. But to the extent it involved the common law, it assuredly did not &lt;i&gt;change&lt;/i&gt; the prior rule: A town not in violation of the statute would continue to be immune. &lt;i&gt;Milborn's Case&lt;/i&gt; simply held that the rule would not be extended to towns that wrongfully failed to close their gates&#151; which involves no overruling, but nothing more than normal, case-by-case common-law adjudication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that framing-era judges in this country considered themselves authorized to reject English common-law precedent they found "barbarous" and "ignorant," see 1 Z. Swift, A System of the Laws of the State of Connecticut 46 (1795) (hereinafter Swift); N. Chipman, A Dissertation on the Act Adopting the Common and Statute Laws of England, in Reports and Dissertations 117, 128 (1793) (hereinafter Chipman). That, however, was not an assertion of &lt;i&gt;judges'&lt;/i&gt;  power to &lt;i&gt;change&lt;/i&gt; the common law. For, as Blackstone wrote, the common law was a law for England, and did not automatically transfer to the American Colonies; rather, it had to be adopted. See 1 Blackstone *107&#151;*108 (observing that "the common law of England, as such, has no allowance or authority" in "[o]ur American plantations"); see also 1 Swift 46 ("The English common law is not in itself binding in this state"); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 44-45 ("The English common law has never been considered to be more obligatory here, than the Roman law has been in England"). In short, the colonial courts felt themselves perfectly free to pick and choose which parts of the English common law they would adopt.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; As stated by &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*476&lt;/span&gt; Chipman 128: "If no reason can be assigned, in support of rules, or precedents, &lt;i&gt;not already adopted in practice,&lt;/i&gt; to adopt such rules, is certainly contrary to the principles of our government." (Emphasis added.) This discretion not to adopt would not presuppose, or even support, the power of colonial courts subsequently to change the accumulated colonial common law. The absence of belief in &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; power is demonstrated by the following passage from 1 Horwitz 5: "Massachusetts Chief Justice Hutchison could declare in 1767 that `laws should be established, else Judges and Juries must go according to their Reason, that is, their Will.' It was also imperative `that &lt;i&gt;the Judge&lt;/i&gt; should never be the &lt;i&gt;Legislator:&lt;/i&gt;  Because, then the Will of the Judge would be the Law: and this tends to a State of Slavery.' " Or, as Judge Swift put it, courts "ought never to be allowed to depart from the well known boundaries of express law, into the wide fields of discretion." 2 Swift 366.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor is the framing era's acceptance of common-law crimes support for the proposition that the Framers accepted an evolving common law. The acknowledgment of a new crime, not thitherto rejected by judicial decision, was not a &lt;i&gt;changing&lt;/i&gt; of the common law, but an &lt;i&gt;application&lt;/i&gt; of it. At the time of the framing, common-law crimes were considered unobjectionable, for "`a law founded on the law of nature may be retrospective, because it always existed,' " 1 Horwitz 7, quoting &lt;i&gt;Blackwell&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wilkinson,&lt;/i&gt; Jefferson's Rep. 73, 77 (Va. 1768) (argument of then-Attorney General John Randolph). Of course, the notion of a common-law crime is utterly anathema today, which leads one to wonder why that is so. The obvious answer is that we now agree with the perceptive chief justice of Connecticut, who wrote in 1796 that common-law crimes "partak[e] of the odious nature of an ex post facto law." 2 Swift 365-366. But, as Horwitz makes clear, a widespread sharing of Swift's "preoccupation with the unfairness of administering a system of judge-made criminal law was a distinctly &lt;i&gt;post-revolutionary&lt;/i&gt; phenomenon, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*477&lt;/span&gt; reflecting a profound change in sensibility. For the inarticulate premise that lay behind Swift's warnings against the danger of judicial discretion was &lt;i&gt;a growing perception that judges no longer merely discovered law; they also made it.&lt;/i&gt; " 1 Horwitz 14-15 (emphases added). In other words, the connection between &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; lawmaking and common-law judging would not have become widely apparent &lt;i&gt;until&lt;/i&gt; common-law judging &lt;i&gt;became&lt;/i&gt; lawmaking, not (as it had been) law declaring. This did not happen, see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1-4, until the 19th century, &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the framing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What occurred in the present case, then, is precisely what Blackstone said&#151;and the Framers believed&#151;would not suffice. The Tennessee Supreme Court made no pretense that the year-and-a-day rule was "bad" law from the outset; rather, it asserted, the need for the rule, as a means of assuring causality of the death, had disappeared with time. Blackstone&#151;and the Framers who were formed by Blackstone&#151;would clearly have regarded that &lt;i&gt;change&lt;/i&gt; in law as a matter for the legislature, beyond the &lt;i&gt;power&lt;/i&gt; of the court. It may well be that some common-law decisions of the era in fact changed the law while purporting not to. But that is beside the point. What is important here is that it was an undoubted point of principle, at the time the Due Process Clause was adopted, that courts could not "change" the law. That explains why the Constitution restricted only the legislature from enacting &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; laws. Under accepted norms of judicial process, an &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; law (in the sense of a judicial holding, not that a prior decision was erroneous, but that the prior valid law is hereby retroactively &lt;i&gt;changed&lt;/i&gt; ) was simply not an option for the courts. This attitude subsisted, I may note, well beyond the founding era, and beyond the time when due process guarantees were extended against the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. In an 1886 admiralty case, for example, this Court said the following: "The rights of persons in this particular under the maritime law of this country are not different from those under &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*478&lt;/span&gt; the common law, and as it is the duty of courts to declare the law, not to make it, we cannot change this rule." &lt;i&gt;The Harrisburg,&lt;/i&gt; 119 U. S. 199, 213-214 (1886), overruled by &lt;i&gt;Moragne&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;States Marine Lines, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 398 U. S. 375 (1970).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not a matter, therefore, of "[e]xtending the &lt;i&gt;[Ex Post Facto]&lt;/i&gt; Clause to courts through the rubric of due process," and thereby "circumvent[ing] the clear constitutional text," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 460. It is simply a matter of determining what due judicial process consists of&#151;and it does not consist of retroactive creation of crimes. The &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause is relevant only because it demonstrates beyond doubt that, however much the acknowledged and accepted role of common-law courts could evolve (as it has) in other respects, retroactive revision of the criminal law was regarded as so fundamentally unfair that an alteration of the judicial role which permits &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; will be a denial of due process. Madison wrote that "&lt;i&gt;ex-post-facto&lt;/i&gt; laws . . . are contrary to the first principles of the social compact, and to every principle of social legislation." The Federalist No. 44, p. 282 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). I find it impossible to believe, as the Court does, that this strong sentiment attached only to retroactive laws passed by the legislature, and would not apply equally (or indeed with even greater force) to a court's production of the same result through disregard of the traditional limits upon judicial power. Insofar as the "first principles of the social compact" are concerned, what possible difference does it make that "[a] court's opportunity for discrimination" by retroactively changing a law "is more limited than a legislature's, in that it can only act in construing existing law in actual litigation"? &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 460-461 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The injustice to the individuals affected is no less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if I agreed with the Court that the Due Process Clause is violated only when there is lack of "fair warning" of the impending retroactive change, I would not find such fair warning here. It is not clear to me, in fact, what the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*479&lt;/span&gt; Court believes the fair warning consisted of. Was it the mere fact that "[t]he year and a day rule is widely viewed as an outdated relic of the common law"? &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 462. So are many of the elements of common-law crimes, such as "breaking the close" as an element of burglary, or "asportation" as an element of larceny. See W. LaFave &amp;amp; A. Scott, Criminal Law 631-633, 708-710 (1972). Are all of these "outdated relics" subject to retroactive judicial rescission? Or perhaps the fair warning consisted of the fact that "the year and a day rule has been legislatively or judicially abolished in the vast majority of jurisdictions recently to have addressed the issue." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 463. But why not count in petitioner's favor (as giving him no reason to expect a change in law) those even more numerous jurisdictions that have chosen &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; "recently to have addressed the issue"? And why not also count in petitioner's favor (rather than &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt;  him) those jurisdictions that have abolished the rule &lt;i&gt;legislatively,&lt;/i&gt; and those jurisdictions that have abolished it through &lt;i&gt;prospective&lt;/i&gt; rather than &lt;i&gt;retroactive&lt;/i&gt; judicial rulings (together, a large majority of the abolitions, see 992 S. W. 2d, at 397, n. 4, 402 (listing statutes and cases))? That is to say, even if it was predictable that the rule would be changed, it was &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; predictable that it would be changed &lt;i&gt;retroactively,&lt;/i&gt;  rather than in the &lt;i&gt;prospective&lt;/i&gt; manner to which legislatures are restricted by the &lt;i&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/i&gt; Clause, or in the &lt;i&gt;prospective&lt;/i&gt; manner that most other courts have employed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, as the Court itself acknowledges, "[d]ue process . . . does not require a person to apprise himself of the common law of all 50 States in order to guarantee that his actions will not subject him to punishment in light of a developing trend in the law that has not yet made its way to his State." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 464. The Court tries to counter this self-evident point with the statement that "[a]t the same time, however, the fact that a vast number of jurisdictions have abolished a rule that has so clearly outlived its purpose is surely relevant to whether the abolition of the rule in a particular case can be said to be unexpected and indefensible &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*480&lt;/span&gt; by reference to the law as it then existed," &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; This retort rests upon the fallacy that I discussed earlier: that "expected or defensible" "abolition" of prior law was approved by &lt;i&gt;Bouie.&lt;/i&gt; It was not&#151;and according such conclusive effect to the "defensibility" (by which I presume the Court means the "reasonableness") of the change in law will validate the retroactive creation of many new crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Court seeks to establish fair warning by discussing at great length, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 464-466, how unclear it was that the year-and-a-day rule was ever the law in Tennessee. As I have already observed, the Supreme Court of Tennessee is the authoritative expositor of Tennessee law, and has said categorically that the year-and-a-day rule was the law. Does the Court mean to establish the principle that fair warning of impending change exists&#151;or perhaps fair warning can be dispensed with&#151;when the prior law is not crystal clear? Yet another boon for retroactively created crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reiterate that the only "fair warning" discussed in our precedents, and the only "fair warning" relevant to the issue before us here, is fair warning &lt;i&gt;of what the law is.&lt;/i&gt; That warning, unlike the new one that today's opinion invents, goes well beyond merely "safeguarding defendants against &lt;i&gt;unjustified&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;unpredictable&lt;/i&gt; breaks with prior law," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt;  at 462 (emphasis added). It safeguards them against &lt;i&gt;changes in the law after the fact.&lt;/i&gt; But even accepting the Court's novel substitute, the opinion's conclusion that this watered-down standard has been met seems to me to proceed on the principle that a large number of almost-valid arguments makes a solid case. As far as I can tell, petitioner had nothing that could fairly be called a "warning" that the Supreme Court of Tennessee would retroactively eliminate one of the elements of the crime of murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To decide this case, we need only conclude that due process prevents a court from (1) acknowledging the validity, when &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*481&lt;/span&gt; they were rendered, of prior decisions establishing a particular element of a crime; (2) changing the prior law so as to eliminate that element; and (3) applying that change to conduct that occurred under the prior regime. A court would remain free to apply common-law criminal rules to new fact patterns, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 461-462, so long as that application is consistent with a fair reading of prior cases. It would remain free to conclude that a prior decision or series of decisions establishing a particular element of a crime was in error, and to apply that conclusion retroactively (so long as the "fair notice" requirement of &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; is satisfied). It would even remain free, insofar as the &lt;i&gt;ex post facto&lt;/i&gt; element of the Due Process Clause is concerned, to "reevaluat[e] and refin[e]" the elements of common-law crimes to its heart's content, so long as it does so prospectively. (The majority of state courts that have abolished the year-and-a-day rule have done so in this fashion.) And, of course (as Blackstone and the Framers envisioned), legislatures would be free to eliminate outmoded elements of common-law crimes for the future &lt;i&gt;by law.&lt;/i&gt; But what a court cannot do, consistent with due process, is what the Tennessee Supreme Court did here: avowedly &lt;i&gt;change&lt;/i&gt; (to the defendant's disadvantage) the criminal law governing past acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Breyer, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with the Court's basic approach. Justice Cardozo pointed out that retroactivity should be determined "not by metaphysical conceptions of the nature of judge-made law, . . . but by considerations of convenience, of utility, and of the deepest sentiments of justice." The Nature of the Judicial Process 148-149 (1921). Similarly, the Due Process Clause asks us to consider the basic fairness or unfairness of retroactive application of the Tennessee court's change in the law. That Clause provides protection against after-the-fact &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*482&lt;/span&gt; changes in criminal law that deprive defendants of fair warning of the nature and consequences of their actions. It does not enshrine Blackstone's "ancient dogma that the law declared by . . . courts had a Platonic or ideal existence before the act of declaration," &lt;i&gt;Great Northern R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sunburst Oil &amp;amp; Refining Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 287 U. S. 358, 365 (1932) (Cardozo, J.). Cf. &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 473-474 (Scalia, J., dissenting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also agree with the Court that, in applying the Due Process Clause, we must ask whether the judicial ruling in question was "unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue." &lt;i&gt;Bouie&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;City of Columbia,&lt;/i&gt; 378 U. S. 347, 354 (1964) (quoting J. Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law 61 (2d ed. 1960) (internal quotation marks omitted)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot agree, however, with the majority's application of that due process principle to this case. As Justice Scalia well explains, Rogers did not have fair warning that the Tennessee courts would abolish the year and a day rule or that they would retroactively apply the new law to the circumstances of his case, thereby upgrading the crime those circumstances revealed from attempted murder to murder. I therefore join Part II of Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1]  Inquiring into a law's original reasonableness was perhaps tantamount to questioning whether it existed at all. "In holding the origin to have been unreasonable, the Court nearly always doubts or denies the actual origin and continuance of the custom &lt;i&gt;in fact.&lt;/i&gt; " C. Allen, Law in the Making 140 (3d ed. 1939) (hereinafter Allen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The near-dispositive strength Blackstone accorded &lt;i&gt;stare decisis&lt;/i&gt; was not some mere personal predilection. Chancellor Kent was of the same view: "If a decision has been made upon solemn argument and mature deliberation, the presumption is in favor of its correctness; and the community have &lt;i&gt;a right&lt;/i&gt; to regard it as a just declaration or exposition of the law, and to regulate their actions and contracts by it." 1 J. Kent, Commentaries *475&#151;*476 (emphasis added). See also Hamilton's statement in The Federalist: "To avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules and precedents which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them." The Federalist No. 78, p. 471 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  In fact, however, "most of the basic departures [from English common law] were accomplished not by judicial decision but by local statute, so that by the time of the American Revolution one hears less and less about the unsuitability of common law principles to the American environment." 1 M. Horwitz, Transformation of American Law 1780-1860, p. 5 (1977) (hereinafter Horwitz).&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*426&lt;/span&gt; Stevens, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, and Breyer, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 443. Scalia, J., &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*426&lt;/span&gt; filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 443. Ginsburg, J., filed a dissenting opinion, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 444.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;William Bradford Reynolds&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs was &lt;i&gt;Bradley J. Schlozman.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jonathan S. Massey&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Laurence H. Tribe, J. Peter Staples,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Thomas C. Goldstein.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury found petitioner guilty of unfair competition and awarded respondent $50,000 in compensatory damages and $4.5 million in punitive damages. The District Court held that the punitive damages award did not violate the Federal Constitution. The Court of Appeals concluded that "the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to reduce the amount of punitive damages." App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a. The issue in this case is whether the Court of Appeals applied the wrong standard of review in considering the constitutionality of the punitive damages award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*427&lt;/span&gt; I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parties are competing tool manufacturers. In the 1980's, Leatherman Tool Group, Inc. (Leatherman or respondent), introduced its Pocket Survival Tool (PST). The Court of Appeals described the PST as an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"ingenious multi-function pocket tool which improves on the classic `Swiss army knife' in a number of respects. Not the least of the improvements was the inclusion of pliers, which, when unfolded, are nearly equivalent to regular full-sized pliers. . . . Leatherman apparently largely created and undisputedly now dominates the market for multi-function pocket tools which generally resemble the PST." &lt;i&gt;Leatherman Tool Group, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cooper Industries,&lt;/i&gt; 199 F. 3d 1009, 1010 (CA9 1999). In 1995, Cooper Industries, Inc. (Cooper or petitioner), decided to design and market a competing multifunction tool. Cooper planned to copy the basic features of the PST, add a few features of its own, and sell the new tool under the name "ToolZall." Cooper hoped to capture about 5% of the multifunction tool market. The first ToolZall was designed to be virtually identical to the PST,&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; but the design was ultimately modified in response to this litigation. The controversy to be resolved in this case involves Cooper's improper advertising of its original ToolZall design.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooper introduced the original ToolZall in August 1996 at the National Hardware Show in Chicago. At that show, it used photographs in its posters, packaging, and advertising materials that purported to be of a ToolZall but were actually of a modified PST. When those materials were prepared, the first of the ToolZalls had not yet been manufactured. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*428&lt;/span&gt; A Cooper employee created a ToolZall "mock-up" by grinding the Leatherman trademark from handles and pliers of a PST and substituting the unique fastenings that were to be used on the ToolZall. At least one of the photographs was retouched to remove a curved indentation where the Leatherman trademark had been. The photographs were used, not only at the trade show, which normally draws an audience of over 70,000 people, but also in the marketing materials and catalogs used by Cooper's sales force throughout the United States. Cooper also distributed a touched-up line drawing of a PST to its international sales representatives.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the trade show, Leatherman filed this action asserting claims of trade-dress infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising under &#167; 43(a) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act), 60 Stat. 441, as amended, 15 U. S. C. &#167; 1125(a) (1994 ed. and Supp. V), and a common-law claim of unfair competition for advertising and selling an "imitation" of the PST. In December 1996, the District Court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting Cooper from marketing the ToolZall and from using pictures of the modified PST in its advertising. Cooper withdrew the original ToolZall from the market and developed a new model with plastic coated handles that differed from the PST. In November 1996, it had anticipatorily sent a notice to its sales personnel ordering a recall of all promotional materials containing pictures of the PST, but it did not attempt to retrieve the materials it had sent to its customers until the following April. As a result, the offending promotional materials continued to appear in catalogs and advertisements well into 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a trial conducted in October 1997, the jury returned a verdict that answered several special interrogatories. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*429&lt;/span&gt; With respect to the Lanham Act infringement claims, the jury found that Leatherman had trademark rights in the overall appearance of the PST and that the original ToolZall infringed those rights but that the infringement had not damaged Leatherman. It then found that the modified ToolZall did not infringe Leatherman's trademark rights in the PST. With respect to the advertising claims, it found Cooper guilty of passing off, false advertising, and unfair competition and assessed aggregate damages of $50,000 on those claims. It then answered "Yes" to the following interrogatory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Has Leatherman shown by clear and convincing evidence that by engaging in false advertising or passing off, Cooper acted with malice, or showed a reckless and outrageous indifference to a highly unreasonable risk of harm and has acted with a conscious indifference to Leatherman's rights?" App. 18.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it answered this question in the affirmative, the jury was instructed to determine the "amount of punitive damages [that] should be awarded to Leatherman." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt;  The jury awarded $4.5 million. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the jury returned its verdict, the District Court considered, and rejected, arguments that the punitive damages were "grossly excessive" under our decision in &lt;i&gt;BMW of North America, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S. 559 (1996). See App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a. It then entered its judgment, which provided that 60% of the punitive damages would be paid to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Account of the State of Oregon. The judgment also permanently enjoined Cooper from marketing its original ToolZall in the United States or in 22 designated foreign countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On appeal, Cooper challenged both the District Court's injunction against copying the PST and the punitive damages award. The Court of Appeals issued two opinions. In its published opinion it set aside the injunction. &lt;i&gt;Leather-&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*430&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;man Tool Group, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cooper Industries, Inc., supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; It held that the overall appearance of the PST was not protected under the trademark laws because its distinguishing features, and the combination of those features, were functional. Accordingly, even though Cooper had deliberately copied the PST, it acted lawfully in doing so.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed the punitive damages award. It first rejected Cooper's argument that the Oregon Constitution, which has been interpreted to prohibit awards of punitive damages for torts that impose liability for speech, precluded the jury's award of such damages in this case. It then reviewed the District Court's finding that the award "was proportional and fair, given the nature of the conduct, the evidence of intentional passing off, and the size of an award necessary to create deterrence to an entity of Cooper's size" and concluded "that the award did not violate Cooper's due process rights" under the Federal Constitution. App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a, judgt. order reported at 205 F. 3d 1351 (CA9 1999). It noted that the "passing off" in this case was "very unusual" because "even assuming PST is a superior product," no superior features of the PST were perceivable in the photographs. App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a. "Any customer who bought based on what the photographs &lt;i&gt;showed&lt;/i&gt; would have received essentially that for which he or she paid." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Thus, Cooper's use of the photographs of the PST did not involve "the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*431&lt;/span&gt; same sort of potential harm to Leatherman or to customers as that which may arise from traditional passing off." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 4a. The Court of Appeals made clear, however, that it did not condone the passing off. "[A]t a minimum," it observed, "[the passing off] gave Cooper an unfair advantage" by allowing it to use Leatherman's work product "to obtain a `mock-up' more cheaply, easily, and quickly" than if it had waited until its own product was ready. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Accordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded, "the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to reduce the amount of punitive damages." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooper's petition for a writ of certiorari asked us to decide whether the Court of Appeals reviewed the constitutionality of the punitive damages award under the correct standard and also whether the award violated the criteria we articulated in &lt;i&gt;Gore.&lt;/i&gt; We granted the petition to resolve confusion among the Courts of Appeals on the first question.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; 531 U. S. 923 (2000). We now conclude that the constitutional issue merits &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; review. Because the Court of Appeals applied an "abuse of discretion" standard, we remand the case for determination of the second question under the proper standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*432&lt;/span&gt; II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although compensatory damages and punitive damages are typically awarded at the same time by the same decisionmaker, they serve distinct purposes. The former are intended to redress the concrete loss that the plaintiff has suffered by reason of the defendant's wrongful conduct. See Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 903, pp. 453-454 (1979); &lt;i&gt;Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Haslip,&lt;/i&gt; 499 U. S. 1, 54 (1991) (O'Connor, J., dissenting). The latter, which have been described as "quasi-criminal," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 19, operate as "private fines" intended to punish the defendant and to deter future wrongdoing. A jury's assessment of the extent of a plaintiff's injury is essentially a factual determination, whereas its imposition of punitive damages is an expression of its moral condemnation. See &lt;i&gt;Gertz&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Robert Welch, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 418 U. S. 323, 350 (1974) ("[Punitive damages] are not compensation for injury. Instead, they are private fines levied by civil juries to punish reprehensible conduct and to deter its future occurrence"); &lt;i&gt;Haslip,&lt;/i&gt; 499 U. S., at 54 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) ("[P]unitive damages are specifically designed to exact punishment in excess of actual harm to make clear that the defendant's misconduct was especially reprehensible").&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legislatures have extremely broad discretion in defining criminal offenses, &lt;i&gt;Schall&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Martin,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 253, 268-269, n. 18 (1984), and in setting the range of permissible punishments for each offense, &lt;i&gt;ibid.; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Solem&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Helm,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S. 277, 290 (1983). Judicial decisions that operate &lt;i&gt;within&lt;/i&gt; these legislatively enacted guidelines are typically reviewed for abuse of discretion. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Koon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 518 U. S. 81, 96, 99-100 (1996); cf. &lt;i&gt;Apprendi&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New Jersey,&lt;/i&gt; 530 U. S. 466, 481 (2000) (it is permissible "for judges to exercise discretion &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*433&lt;/span&gt; . . . in imposing a judgment &lt;i&gt;within the range&lt;/i&gt; prescribed by statute").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the criminal sentencing context, legislatures enjoy broad discretion in authorizing and limiting permissible punitive damages awards. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S., at 568 ("States necessarily have considerable flexibility in determining the level of punitive damages that they will allow in different classes of cases and in any particular case"). A good many States have enacted statutes that place limits on the permissible size of punitive damages awards.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; When juries make particular awards within those limits, the role of the trial judge is "to determine whether the jury's verdict is within the confines set by state law, and to determine, by reference to federal standards developed under Rule 59, whether a new trial or remittitur should be ordered." &lt;i&gt;Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kelco Disposal, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 492 U. S. 257, 279 (1989). If no constitutional issue is raised, the role of the appellate court, at least in the federal system, is merely to review the trial court's "determination under an abuse-ofdiscretion standard." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the broad discretion that States possess with respect to the imposition of criminal penalties and punitive damages, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution imposes substantive limits on that discretion. That Clause makes the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against excessive fines and cruel and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*434&lt;/span&gt; unusual punishments applicable to the States. &lt;i&gt;Furman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; 408 U. S. 238 (1972) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam).&lt;/i&gt; The Due Process Clause of its own force also prohibits the States from imposing "grossly excessive" punishments on tortfeasors, &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S., at 562; &lt;i&gt;TXO Production Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Alliance Resources Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 509 U. S. 443, 453-455 (1993) (plurality opinion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court has enforced those limits in cases involving deprivations of life, &lt;i&gt;Enmund&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Florida,&lt;/i&gt; 458 U. S. 782, 787, 801 (1982) (death is not "a valid penalty under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments for one who neither took life, attempted to take life, nor intended to take life"); &lt;i&gt;Coker&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; 433 U. S. 584, 592 (1977) (opinion of White, J.) (sentence of death is "grossly disproportionate" and excessive punishment for the crime of rape);&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; deprivations of liberty, &lt;i&gt;Solem&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Helm,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S., at 279, 303 (life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for nonviolent felonies is "significantly disproportionate"); and deprivations of property, &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bajakajian,&lt;/i&gt; 524 U. S. 321, 324 (1998) (punitive forfeiture of $357,144 for violating reporting requirement was "grossly disporportional" to the gravity of the offense); &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S., at 585-586 ($2 million punitive damages award for failing to advise customers of minor predelivery repairs to new automobiles was "grossly excessive" and therefore unconstitutional).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these cases, the constitutional violations were predicated on judicial determinations that the punishments were "grossly disproportional to the gravity of . . . defendant[s'] offense[s]." &lt;i&gt;Bajakajian,&lt;/i&gt; 524 U. S., at 334; see also &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S., at 585-586; &lt;i&gt;Solem,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S., at 303; &lt;i&gt;Coker,&lt;/i&gt; 433 U. S., at 592 (opinion of White, J.). We have recognized that the relevant constitutional line is "inherently imprecise," &lt;i&gt;Ba-&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*435&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;jakajian,&lt;/i&gt; 524 U. S., at 336, rather than one "marked by a simple mathematical formula," &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S., at 582. But in deciding whether that line has been crossed, we have focused on the same general criteria: the degree of the defendant's reprehensibility or culpability, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bajakajian,&lt;/i&gt;  524 U. S., at 337; &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S., at 575-580; &lt;i&gt;Solem,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S., at 290-291; &lt;i&gt;Enmund,&lt;/i&gt; 458 U. S., at 798; &lt;i&gt;Coker,&lt;/i&gt; 433 U. S., at 598 (opinion of White, J.); the relationship between the penalty and the harm to the victim caused by the defendant's actions, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bajakajian,&lt;/i&gt; 524 U. S., at 339; &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt;  517 U. S., at 580-583; &lt;i&gt;Solem,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S., at 293; &lt;i&gt;Enmund,&lt;/i&gt; 458 U. S., at 798; &lt;i&gt;Coker,&lt;/i&gt; 433 U. S., at 598 (opinion of White, J.); and the sanctions imposed in other cases for comparable misconduct, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bajakajian,&lt;/i&gt; 524 U. S., at 340-343; &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt;  517 U. S., at 583-585; &lt;i&gt;Solem,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S., at 291; &lt;i&gt;Enmund,&lt;/i&gt; 458 U. S., at 789-796; &lt;i&gt;Coker,&lt;/i&gt; 433 U. S., at 593-597 (opinion of White, J.). Moreover, and of greatest relevance for the issue we address today, in each of these cases we have engaged in an independent examination of the relevant criteria. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bajakajian,&lt;/i&gt; 524 U. S., at 337-344; &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S., at 575-586; &lt;i&gt;Solem,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S., at 295-300; &lt;i&gt;Enmund,&lt;/i&gt; 458 U. S., at 788-801; &lt;i&gt;Coker,&lt;/i&gt; 433 U. S., at 592-600 (opinion of White, J.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Bajakajian,&lt;/i&gt; we expressly noted that the courts of appeals must review the proportionality determination &lt;i&gt;"de novo"&lt;/i&gt; and specifically rejected the suggestion of the respondent, who had prevailed in the District Court, that the trial judge's determination of excessiveness should be reviewed only for an abuse of discretion. "The factual findings made by the district courts in conducting the excessiveness inquiry, of course, must be accepted unless clearly erroneous. . . . But the question whether a fine is constitutionally excessive calls for the application of a constitutional standard to the facts of a particular case, and in this context &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; review of that question is appropriate." 524 U. S., at 336-337, n. 10 (citing &lt;i&gt;Ornelas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S. 690, 697 (1996)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*436&lt;/span&gt; Likewise, in &lt;i&gt;Ornelas,&lt;/i&gt; we held that trial judges' determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause should be reviewed &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; on appeal. The reasons we gave in support of that holding are equally applicable in this case. First, as we observed in &lt;i&gt;Ornelas,&lt;/i&gt; the precise meaning of concepts like "reasonable suspicion" and "probable cause" cannot be articulated with precision; they are "fluid concepts that take their substantive content from the particular contexts in which the standards are being assessed." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 696. That is, of course, also a characteristic of the concept of "gross excessiveness." Second, "the legal rules for probable cause and reasonable suspicion acquire content only through application. Independent review is therefore necessary if appellate courts are to maintain control of, and to clarify, the legal principles." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 697. Again, this is also true of the general criteria set forth in &lt;i&gt;Gore;&lt;/i&gt; they will acquire more meaningful content through case-by-case application at the appellate level. "Finally, &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; review tends to unify precedent" and "`stabilize the law.' " 517 U. S., at 697&#151; 698. Justice Breyer made a similar point in his concurring opinion in &lt;i&gt;Gore:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Requiring the application of law, rather than a decisionmaker's caprice, does more than simply provide citizens notice of what actions may subject them to punishment; it also helps to assure the uniform general treatment of similarly situated persons that is the essence of law itself." 517 U. S., at 587.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our decisions in analogous cases, together with the reasoning that produced those decisions, thus convince us that courts of appeals should apply a &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; standard of review when passing on district courts' determinations of the constitutionality of punitive damages awards.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*437&lt;/span&gt; III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unlike the measure of actual damages suffered, which presents a question of historical or predictive fact, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt;  [&lt;i&gt;St. Louis, I. M. &amp;amp; S. R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Craft,&lt;/i&gt; 237 U. S. 648 (1915)], the level of punitive damages is not really a `fact' `tried' by the jury." &lt;i&gt;Gasperini&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Center for Humanities, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt;  518 U. S. 415, 459 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Because the jury's award of punitive damages does not constitute a finding of "fact," appellate review of the district court's determination that an award is consistent with due process does not implicate the Seventh Amendment concerns raised by respondent and its &lt;i&gt;amicus.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; See Brief for Respondent 18-24; Brief for Association of Trial Lawyers of America as &lt;i&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 17-20. Our decisions in &lt;i&gt;Gasperini&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Hetzel&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Prince William County,&lt;/i&gt; 523 U. S. 208 (1998) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; both of which concerned compensatory damages, are not to the contrary.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*438&lt;/span&gt; It might be argued that the deterrent function of punitive damages suggests that the amount of such damages awarded is indeed a "fact" found by the jury and that, as a result, the Seventh Amendment is implicated in appellate review of that award. Some scholars, for example, assert that punitive damages should be used to compensate for the underdeterrence of unlawful behavior that will result from a defendant's evasion of liability. See Polinsky &amp;amp; Shavell, Punitive Damages: An Economic Analysis, 111 Harv. L. Rev. 869, 890-891 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*439&lt;/span&gt; (1998) (in order to obtain optimal deterrence, "punitive damages should equal the harm multiplied by . . . the ratio of the injurer's chance of escaping liability to his chance of being found liable"); see also &lt;i&gt;Ciraolo&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York,&lt;/i&gt; 216 F. 3d 236, 244-245 (CA2 2000) (Calabresi, J., concurring). "The efficient deterrence theory thus regards punitive damages as merely an augmentation of compensatory damages designed to achieve economic efficiency." Galanter &amp;amp; Luban, Poetic Justice: Punitive Damages and Legal Pluralism, 42 Am. U. L. Rev. 1393, 1449 (1993).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However attractive such an approach to punitive damages might be as an abstract policy matter, it is clear that juries do not normally engage in such a finely tuned exercise of deterrence calibration when awarding punitive damages. See Sunstein, Schkade, &amp;amp; Kahneman, Do People Want Optimal Deterrence?, 29 J. Legal Studies 237, 240 (2000). After all, deterrence is not the only purpose served by punitive damages. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 432. And there is no dispute that, in this case, deterrence was but one of four concerns the jury was instructed to consider when setting the amount of punitive damages.&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt; Moreover, it is not at all obvious that even the &lt;i&gt;deterrent&lt;/i&gt; function of punitive damages can be served &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; by economically "optimal deterrence." "[C]itizens and legislators may rightly insist that they are willing to tolerate some loss in economic efficiency in order to deter what they consider morally offensive conduct, albeit costbeneficial &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*440&lt;/span&gt; morally offensive conduct; efficiency is just one consideration among many." Galanter &amp;amp; Luban, 42 Am. U. L. Rev., at 1450.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differences in the institutional competence of trial judges and appellate judges are consistent with our conclusion. In &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt; we instructed courts evaluating a punitive damages award's consistency with due process to consider three criteria: (1) the degree or reprehensibility of the defendant's misconduct, (2) the disparity between the harm (or potential harm) suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award, and (3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases. 517 U. S., at 574-575. Only with respect to the first &lt;i&gt;Gore&lt;/i&gt; inquiry do the district courts have a somewhat superior vantage over courts of appeals, and even then the advantage exists primarily with respect to issues turning on witness credibility and demeanor.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; Trial courts and appellate courts seem equally capable of analyzing the second factor. And the third &lt;i&gt;Gore&lt;/i&gt; criterion, which calls for a broad legal comparison, seems more suited to the expertise of appellate courts. Considerations of institutional competence therefore fail to tip the balance in favor of deferential appellate review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*441&lt;/span&gt; IV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible that the standard of review applied by the Court of Appeals will affect the result of the &lt;i&gt;Gore&lt;/i&gt; analysis in only a relatively small number of cases. See Brief for Respondent 46-48; Brief for Association of American Railroads as &lt;i&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 18; see also &lt;i&gt;Gasperini,&lt;/i&gt; 518 U. S., at 448 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Nonetheless, it does seem likely that in this case a thorough, independent review of the District Court's rejection of petitioner's due process objections to the punitive damages award might well have led the Court of Appeals to reach a different result. Indeed, our own consideration of each of the three &lt;i&gt;Gore&lt;/i&gt; factors reveals a series of questionable conclusions by the District Court that may not survive &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the jury assessed the reprehensibility of Cooper's misconduct, it was guided by instructions that characterized the deliberate copying of the PST as wrongful. The jury's selection of a penalty to deter wrongful conduct may, therefore, have been influenced by an intent to deter Cooper from engaging in such copying in the future. Similarly, the District Court's belief that Cooper acted unlawfully in deliberately copying the PST design might have influenced its consideration of the first &lt;i&gt;Gore&lt;/i&gt; factor. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a. But, as the Court of Appeals correctly held, such copying of the functional features of an unpatented product is lawful. See &lt;i&gt;TrafFix Devices, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Marketing Displays, Inc., ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 23. The Court of Appeals recognized that the District Court's award of attorney's fees could not be supported if based on the premise that the copying was unlawful, but it did not consider whether that improper predicate might also have undermined the basis for the jury's large punitive damages award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In evaluating the second &lt;i&gt;Gore&lt;/i&gt; factor, the ratio between the size of the award of punitive damages and the harm caused by Cooper's tortious conduct, the District Court &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*442&lt;/span&gt; might have been influenced by respondent's submission that it was not the actual injury&#151;which the jury assessed at $50,000&#151;that was relevant, but rather "the potential harm Leatherman would have suffered had Cooper succeeded in its wrongful conduct." See Brief for Respondent 7; see also Record Doc. No. 323, p. 23. Respondent calculated that "potential harm" by referring to the fact that Cooper had anticipated "gross profits of approximately $3 million during the first five years of sales." Brief for Respondent 7; see also Record Doc. No. 323, at 23. Even if that estimate were correct, however, it would be unrealistic to assume that all of Cooper's sales of the ToolZall would have been attributable to its misconduct in using a photograph of a modified PST in its initial advertising materials. As the Court of Appeals pointed out, the picture of the PST did not misrepresent the features of the original ToolZall and could not have deceived potential customers in any significant way. Its use was wrongful because it enabled Cooper to expedite the promotion of its tool, but that wrongdoing surely could not be treated as the principal cause of Cooper's entire sales volume for a 5-year period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to the third &lt;i&gt;Gore&lt;/i&gt; factor, respondent argues that Cooper would have been subject to a comparable sanction under Oregon's Unlawful Trade Practices Act. Brief for Respondent 49. In a suit brought by a State under that Act, a civil penalty of up to $25,000 per violation may be assessed. Ore. Rev. Stat. &#167; 646.642(3) (1997). In respondent's view, &lt;i&gt;each&lt;/i&gt; of the thousands of pieces of promotional material containing a picture of the PST that Cooper distributed warranted the maximum fine. Brief for Respondent 49. Petitioner, on the other hand, argues that its preparation of a single "mock-up" for use in a single distribution would have been viewed as a single violation under the state statute. Reply Brief for Petitioner 2-3. The Court of Appeals expressed no opinion on this dispute. It did, however, observe that the unfairness in Cooper's use of the picture &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*443&lt;/span&gt; apparently had nothing to do with misleading customers but was related to its inability to obtain a "mock-up" quickly and cheaply. App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a. This observation is more consistent with the single-violation theory than with the notion that the statutory violation would have been sanctioned with a multimillion dollar fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have made these comments on issues raised by application of the three &lt;i&gt;Gore&lt;/i&gt; guidelines to the facts of this case, not to prejudge the answer to the constitutional question, but rather to illustrate why we are persuaded that the Court of Appeals' answer to that question may depend upon the standard of review. The &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; standard should govern its decision. Because the Court of Appeals applied a less demanding standard in this case, we vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Thomas, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continue to believe that the Constitution does not constrain the size of punitive damages awards. See &lt;i&gt;BMW of North America, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S. 559, 599 (1996) (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., dissenting). For this reason, given the opportunity, I would vote to overrule &lt;i&gt;BMW.&lt;/i&gt;  This case, however, does not present such an opportunity. The only issue before us today is what standard should be used to review a trial court's ruling on a &lt;i&gt;BMW&lt;/i&gt; challenge. Because I agree with the Court's resolution of that issue, I join the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was (and remain) of the view that excessive punitive damages do not violate the Due Process Clause; but the Court held otherwise. See &lt;i&gt;BMW of North America, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S. 559 (1996); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 598 (Scalia, J., dissenting). And I was of the view that we should review for abuse &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*444&lt;/span&gt; of discretion (rather than &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; ) fact-bound constitutional issues which, in their resistance to meaningful generalization, resemble the question of excessiveness of punitive damages&#151;namely, whether there exists reasonable suspicion for a stop and probable cause for a search; but the Court held otherwise. See &lt;i&gt;Ornelas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S. 690 (1996); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 700 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Finally, in a case in which I joined a dissent that made it unnecessary for me to reach the issue, the Court categorically stated that "the question whether a fine is constitutionally excessive calls for . . . &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; review." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bajakajian,&lt;/i&gt;  524 U. S. 321, 336-337, n. 10 (1998); see &lt;i&gt;id.&lt;/i&gt; , at 344 (Kennedy, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J.,and O'Connor and Scalia, JJ., dissenting). Given these precedents, I agree that &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; review of the question of excessive punitive damages best accords with our jurisprudence. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Ginsburg, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Gasperini&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Center for Humanities, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 518 U. S. 415 (1996), we held that appellate review of a federal trial court's refusal to set aside a jury verdict as excessive is reconcilable with the Seventh Amendment if "appellate control [is] limited to review for `abuse of discretion.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 419. &lt;i&gt;Gasperini&lt;/i&gt; was a diversity action in which the defendant had challenged a compensatory damages award as excessive under New York law. The reasoning of that case applies as well to an action challenging a punitive damages award as excessive under the Constitution. I would hold, therefore, that the proper standard of appellate oversight is not &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; review, as the Court today concludes, but review for abuse of discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"An essential characteristic of [the federal court] system is the manner in which, in civil common-law actions, it distributes trial functions between judge and jury and, under the influence&#151;if not the command&#151;of the Seventh Amendment, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*445&lt;/span&gt; assigns the decisions of disputed questions of fact to the jury." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 432 (citing &lt;i&gt;Byrd&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 356 U. S. 525, 537 (1958)). The Seventh Amendment provides: "In Suits at common law . . . the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law." In &lt;i&gt;Gasperini,&lt;/i&gt; we observed that although trial courts traditionally had broad authority at common law to set aside jury verdicts and to grant new trials, 518 U. S., at 432-433, "appellate review of a federal trial court's denial of a motion to set aside a jury's verdict as excessive is a relatively late, and less secure, development," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 434. We ultimately concluded that the Seventh Amendment does not preclude such appellate review, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 436, but explained that "[w]ithin the federal system, practical reasons combine with Seventh Amendment constraints to lodge in the district court, not the court of appeals, primary responsibility for application of [an excessiveness standard]," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 438. "Trial judges have the unique opportunity to consider the evidence in the living courtroom context," we said, "while appellate judges see only the cold paper record." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). "If [courts of appeals] reverse, it must be because of an abuse of discretion. . . . The very nature of the problem counsels restraint. . . . [Appellate courts] must give the benefit of every doubt to the judgment of the trial judge." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 438-439 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing &lt;i&gt;Dagnello&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Long Island R. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 289 F. 2d 797, 806 (CA2 1961)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;i&gt;Gasperini&lt;/i&gt; involved compensatory damages, I see no reason why its logic should be abandoned when punitive damages are alleged to be excessive. At common law, as our longstanding decisions reiterate, the task of determining the amount of punitive damages "has [always been] left to the discretion of the jury." &lt;i&gt;Day&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wood worth,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;How.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;363&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 371 (1852); see &lt;i&gt;Barry&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Edmunds,&lt;/i&gt; 116 U. S. 550, 565 (1886) &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*446&lt;/span&gt; ("[N]othing is better settled than that . . . it is the peculiar function of the jury to determine the amount [of punitive damages] by their verdict."). The commitment of this function to the jury, we have explained, reflects the historical understanding that "the degree of punishment to be thus inflicted must depend on the peculiar circumstances of each case." &lt;i&gt;Day,&lt;/i&gt; 13 How., at 371. The relevant factors include "the conduct and motives of the defendant" and whether, "in committing the wrong complained of, he acted recklessly, or wilfully and maliciously, with a design to oppress and injure the plaintiff." 1 J. Sutherland, Law of Damages 720 (1882). Such inquiry, the Court acknowledges, "is a factsensitive undertaking." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 438, n. 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court nevertheless today asserts that a "jury's award of punitive damages does not constitute a finding of `fact' " within the meaning of the Seventh Amendment. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 437. An ultimate award of punitive damages, it is true, involves more than the resolution of matters of historical or predictive fact. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; (citing &lt;i&gt;Gasperini,&lt;/i&gt; 518 U. S., at 459 (Scalia, J., dissenting)). But there can be no question that a jury's verdict on punitive damages is fundamentally dependent on determinations we characterize as fact findings&#151; &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; the extent of harm or potential harm caused by the defendant's misconduct, whether the defendant acted in good faith, whether the misconduct was an individual instance or part of a broader pattern, whether the defendant behaved negligently, recklessly, or maliciously. Punitive damages are thus not "[u]nlike the measure of actual damages suffered," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 437 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), in cases of intangible, noneconomic injury. One million dollars' worth of pain and suffering does not exist as a "fact" in the world any more or less than one million dollars' worth of moral outrage. Both derive their meaning from a set of underlying facts as determined by a jury. If one exercise in quantification is properly regarded as fact finding, see &lt;i&gt;St. Louis, I. M. &amp;amp; S. R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Craft,&lt;/i&gt; 237 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*447&lt;/span&gt; U. S. 648, 661 (1915) (compensation for pain and suffering "involves only a question of fact"), it seems to me the other should be so regarded as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kelco Disposal, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 492 U. S. 257 (1989), we approved application of an abuse-of-discretion standard for appellate review of a district court's ruling on a motion to set aside a punitive damages award as excessive. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 279. &lt;i&gt;BrowningFerris&lt;/i&gt; reserved the question whether even such deferential appellate review might run afoul of the Seventh Amendment. At that time (&lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; pre-&lt;i&gt;Gasperini&lt;/i&gt; ), the Court "ha[d] never held expressly that the Seventh Amendment allows appellate review of a district court's denial of a motion to set aside an award as excessive." 492 U. S., at 279, n. 25. We found it unnecessary to reach the Seventh Amendment question in &lt;i&gt;Browning-Ferris&lt;/i&gt; because the jury verdict there survived lower court review intact. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 279, n. 25, 280. &lt;i&gt;Browning-Ferris,&lt;/i&gt; in short, signaled our recognition that appellate review of punitive damages, if permissible at all, would involve &lt;i&gt;at most&lt;/i&gt; abuse-of-discretion review. "[P]articularly . . . because the federal courts operate under the strictures of the Seventh Amendment," we were "reluctant to stray too far from traditional common-law standards, or to take steps which ultimately might interfere with the proper role of the jury." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 280, n. 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court finds no incompatibility between this case and &lt;i&gt;Browning-Ferris,&lt;/i&gt; observing that &lt;i&gt;Browning-Ferris&lt;/i&gt; presented for our review an excessiveness challenge resting solely on state law, not on the Constitution. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 433, and n. 7. It is unclear to me why this distinction should make a difference. Of the three guideposts &lt;i&gt;BMW of North America, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S. 559 (1996), established for assessing constitutional excessiveness, two were derived from common-law standards that typically inform state law. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 575, n. 24 ("The principle that punishment should fit the crime is deeply rooted and frequently repeated in &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*448&lt;/span&gt; common-law jurisprudence." (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 580 ("The principle that exemplary damages must bear a `reasonable relationship' to compensatory damages has a long pedigree."). The third guidepost&#151;comparability of sanctions for comparable misconduct&#151;is not similarly rooted in common law, nor is it similarly fact bound. As the Court states, "the third &lt;i&gt;Gore&lt;/i&gt;  criterion . . . calls for a broad legal comparison." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 440. But to the extent the inquiry is "legal" in character, there is little difference between review &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; and review for abuse of discretion. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Gasperini,&lt;/i&gt; 518 U. S., at 448 (Stevens, J., dissenting) ("[I]t is a familiar . . . maxim that deems an error of law an abuse of discretion.").&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from "Seventh Amendment constraints," an abuseof-discretion standard also makes sense for "practical reasons." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 438. With respect to the first &lt;i&gt;Gore&lt;/i&gt; inquiry (&lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct), district courts have an undeniably superior vantage over courts of appeals. As earlier noted, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 445, district courts view the evidence not on a "cold paper record," but "in the living courtroom context," &lt;i&gt;Gasperini,&lt;/i&gt; 518 U. S., at 438. They can assess from the best seats the vital matter of witness credibility. And "it of course remains true that [a] &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*449&lt;/span&gt; Court of Appeals should defer to the District Court's findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 440, n. 14.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court recognizes that district courts have the edge on the first &lt;i&gt;Gore&lt;/i&gt; factor, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 440, but goes on to say that "[t]rial courts and appellate courts seem equally capable of analyzing the second &lt;i&gt;[Gore]&lt;/i&gt; factor" (&lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; whether punitive damages bear a reasonable relationship to the actual harm inflicted), &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Only "the third &lt;i&gt;Gore&lt;/i&gt; criterion [&lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; intrajurisdictional and inter jurisdictional comparisons] . . . seems more suited to the expertise of appellate courts." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the extent the second factor requires a determination of "the actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff," &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S., at 580, district courts may be better positioned to conduct the inquiry, especially in cases of intangible injury. I can demur to the Court's assessment of relative institutional strengths, however, for even accepting that assessment, I would disagree with the Court's conclusion that "[c]onsiderations of institutional competence . . . fail to tip the balance in favor of deferential appellate review," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 440. &lt;i&gt;Gore&lt;/i&gt;  itself assigned particular importance to the first inquiry, characterizing "degree of reprehensibility" as "[p]erhaps the most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award." 517 U. S., at 575. District courts, as just noted, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 448 and this page, have a superior vantage over courts of appeals in conducting that fact-intensive inquiry. Therefore, in the typical case envisioned by &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt;  where reasonableness is primarily tied to reprehensibility, an appellate court should have infrequent occasion to reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This observation, I readily acknowledge, suggests that the practical difference between the Court's approach and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*450&lt;/span&gt; my own is not large. An abuse-of-discretion standard, as I see it, hews more closely to "the strictures of the Seventh Amendment," &lt;i&gt;Browning-Ferris,&lt;/i&gt; 492 U. S., at 280, n. 26. The Court's &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; standard is more complex. It requires lower courts to distinguish between ordinary common-law excessiveness and constitutional excessiveness, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 433, and to separate out fact findings that qualify for "clearly erroneous" review, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 440, n. 14. See also &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 440, n. 13 (suggesting abuse-of-discretion review might be in order "if a State were to adopt a scheme that tied the award of punitive damages more tightly to the jury's finding of compensatory damages"). The Court's approach will be challenging to administer. Complex as it is, I suspect that approach and mine will yield different outcomes in few cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ninth Circuit, I conclude, properly identified abuse of discretion as the appropriate standard in reviewing the District Court's determination that the punitive damages awarded against Cooper were not grossly excessive. For the Seventh Amendment and practical reasons stated, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1]  The ToolZall was marked with a different name than the PST, was held together with different fasteners,and, in the words of the Court of Appeals, "included a serrated blade and certain other small but not particularly visible differences."&lt;i&gt;Leatherman Tool Group, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cooper Industries,&lt;/i&gt; 199 F. 3d 1009, 1010 (CA9 1999).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  To "create" the drawing, a Cooper manager photocopied a line-art drawing of a PST and then "whited out" Leatherman's trademark. App. 43-47.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Because this holding removed the predicate for the award of fees under the Lanham Act, see n. 2, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; the Court of Appeals set aside that award and directed the District Court, on remand, to consider whether the evidence of passing off, standing alone, was sufficient to warrant a fee award. The Court of Appeals noted that the jury verdict form did not distinguish between passing off as a Lanham Act claim and passing off as a matter of state law. Although a fee award under &#167; 35(a)could not be supported unless the federal statute was violated, there is no reason to believe that any possible difference between federal and state passing off would affect the constitutionality of the punitive damages award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Respondent and its &lt;i&gt;amicus&lt;/i&gt; at times appear to conflate the question of the proper standard for reviewing the District Court's due process determination with the question of the substantive standard for determining the jury award's conformity with due process in the first instance. See Brief for Arthur F. McEvoy as &lt;i&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 13 ("[O]n appeal the litigant's objection to the &lt;i&gt;substance&lt;/i&gt; of the jury's holding&#151;whether on liability or damages&#151;should be evaluated under a `rational fact finder' standard . . ."); Brief for Respondent 13. The former is the question we agreed to review. The latter question has already been answered in &lt;i&gt;BMW of North America, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v.&lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S.559 (1996). Thus, our rejection in &lt;i&gt;TXO Production Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Alliance Resources Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 509 U. S. 443 (1993), of "heightened scrutiny" of punitive damages awards, see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 456, is not only wholly consistent with our decision today, it is irrelevant to our resolution of the question presented.&lt;/p&gt;

J. 2071, 2074 (1998) ("[P]unitive damages may have a retributive or expressive function, designed to embody social outrage at the action of serious wrongdoers").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  See &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S., at 614-619 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Since our decision in &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt; four additional States have added punitive damages caps: Alabama, Alaska, North Carolina, and Ohio. See Ala. Code &#167; 6-11-21 (Supp. 2000); Alaska Stat. Ann. &#167; 09.17.020 (2000); N. C. Gen. Stat. &#167; 1D-25 (1999); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &#167; 2315.21 (Supp. 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  In &lt;i&gt;Browning-Ferris,&lt;/i&gt; the petitioner did argue that the award violated the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment, but we held the Clause inapplicable to punitive damages. The petitioner's reliance on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was unavailing because that argument had not been raised in the District Court, the Court of Appeals, or the certiorari petition. See 492 U. S., at 276-277.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  Although disagreeing with the specific holding in &lt;i&gt;Coker,&lt;/i&gt; Chief Justice Burger and then-Justice Rehnquist accepted the proposition that the "concept of disproportionality bars the death penalty for minor crimes." 433 U. S., at 604 (Burger, C. J., dissenting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9]  Contrary to respondent's assertion, Brief for Respondent 12-13, our decision today is &lt;i&gt;supported&lt;/i&gt; by our reasoning in &lt;i&gt;Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Haslip,&lt;/i&gt; 499 U. S. 1, 20-21 (1991). In that case, we emphasized the importance of appellate review to ensuring that a jury's award of punitive damages comports with due process. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 20-21 ("[A]ppellate review makes certain that the punitive damages are reasonable in their amount and rational in light of their purpose to punish what has occurred and to deter its repetition").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[10]  Respondent argues that our decision in &lt;i&gt;Honda Motor Co.&lt;/i&gt; v.&lt;i&gt;Oberg,&lt;/i&gt;  512 U. S. 415 (1994), rests upon the assumption that punitive damages awards are findings of fact. In that case, we held that the Oregon Constitution, which prohibits the reexamination of any "fact tried by a jury," Ore. Const., Art. VII, &#167; 3, violated due process because it did not allow for any review of the constitutionality of punitive damages awards. Respondent claims that, because we considered this provision of the Oregon Constitution to cover punitive damages, we implicitly held that punitive damages are a "fact tried by a jury." Brief for Respondent 27-28. It was the Oregon Supreme Court's interpretation of that provision, however, and not our own, that compelled the treatment of punitive damages as covered. See &lt;i&gt;Oberg,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S., at 427; see also &lt;i&gt;Van Lom&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Schneiderman,&lt;/i&gt; 187 Ore. 89, 93, 210 P. 2d 461, 462 (1949) (construing the Oregon Constitution).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[11]  Nor does the historical material upon which respondent relies so extensively, see Brief for Respondent 19-24, conflict with our decision to require &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; review. Most of the sources respondent cites merely stand for the proposition that, perhaps because it is a fact-sensitive undertaking, determining the amount of punitive damages should be left to the discretion of the jury. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Barry&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Edmunds,&lt;/i&gt; 116 U. S. 550, 565 (1886) ("[I]t is the peculiar function of the jury" to set the amount of punitive damages); &lt;i&gt;Day&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wood worth,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;How.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;363&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 371 (1852) (punitive damages should be "left to the discretion of the jury"). They do not, however, indicate that the amount of punitive damages imposed by the jury is itself a "fact" within the meaning of the Seventh Amendment's Reexamination Clause. See &lt;i&gt;Gasperini&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Center for Humanities, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt;  518 U. S. 415, 432 (1996) (distinguishing between the "Trial by Jury" Clause, which "bears . . . on the allocation of trial functions between judge and jury," and the "Reexamination" Clause, which "controls the allocation of authority to review verdicts"); see also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 447-448 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (same).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, punitive damages have evolved somewhat since the time of respondent's sources. Until well into the 19th century, punitive damages frequently operated to compensate for intangible injuries, compensation which was not otherwise available under the narrow conception of compensatory damages prevalent at the time. See &lt;i&gt;Haslip,&lt;/i&gt; 499 U. S., at 61 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); see also Note, Exemplary Damages in the Law of Torts, 70 Harv. L. Rev. 517, 520 (1957) (observing a "vacillation" in the 19th-century cases between "compensatory" and "punitive" theories of "exemplary damages"). As the types of compensatory damages available to plaintiffs have broadened, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 1 J. Nates, C. Kimball, D. Axelrod, &amp;amp; R. Goldstein, Damages in Tort Actions &#167; 3.01[3][a] (2000) (pain and suffering are generally available as species of compensatory damages), the theory behind punitive damages has shifted toward a more purely punitive (and therefore less factual) understanding. Cf. Note, 70 Harv. L. Rev., at 520 (noting a historical shift away from a compensatory&#151;and toward a more purely punitive&#151;conception of punitive damages).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[12]  The jury was instructed to consider the following factors: (1) "The character of the defendant's conduct that is the subject of Leatherman's unfair competition claims"; (2) "The defendant's motive"; (3) "The sum of money that would be required to discourage the defendant and others from engaging in such conduct in the future"; and (4) "The defendant's income and assets." App. 14. Although the jury's application of these instructions may have depended on specific findings of fact, nothing in our decision today suggests that the Seventh Amendment would permit a court, in reviewing a punitive damages award, to disregard such jury findings. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S., at 579-580.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[13]  We express no opinion on the question whether &lt;i&gt;Gasperini&lt;/i&gt; would govern&#151;and &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; review would be inappropriate&#151;if a State were to adopt a scheme that tied the award of punitive damages more tightly to the jury's finding of compensatory damages. This might be the case, for example, if the State's scheme constrained a jury to award only the exact amount of punitive damages it determined was necessary to obtain economically optimal deterrence or if it defined punitive damages as a multiple of compensatory damages (&lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; treble damages).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[14]  While we have determined that the Court of Appeals must review the District Court's application of the &lt;i&gt;Gore&lt;/i&gt; test &lt;i&gt;de novo,&lt;/i&gt; it of course remains true that the Court of Appeals should defer to the District Court's findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. See &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bajakajian,&lt;/i&gt; 524 U. S. 321, 336-337, n. 10 (1998).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Appellate courts, following our instruction, apply &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; review to trial court determinations of reasonable suspicion, probable cause, and excessiveness of fines. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 435-436 (citing &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bajakajian,&lt;/i&gt; 524 U. S. 321, 336-337, n. 10 (1998), and &lt;i&gt;Ornelas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt;  517 U. S. 690, 696-698 (1996)). But such determinations typically are made without jury involvement, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bajakajian,&lt;/i&gt; 524 U. S., at 325&#151; 326; &lt;i&gt;Ornelas,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S., at 694, and surely do not implicate the Seventh Amendment. Moreover, although &lt;i&gt;Bajakajian&lt;/i&gt; said "the question whether a [criminal] fine is constitutionally excessive calls for . . . &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; review," 524 U. S., at 336-337, n. 10, &lt;i&gt;Bajakajian&lt;/i&gt; did not disturb our holding in &lt;i&gt;Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kelco Disposal, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 492 U. S. 257 (1989), that the "Excessive Fines Clause does not apply to awards of punitive damages in [civil] cases between private parties," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 260.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  An appellate court might be at a loss to accord such deference to jury findings of fact absent trial court employment of either a special verdict or a general verdict accompanied by written interrogatories. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 49.&lt;/p&gt;

v.&lt;br&gt;
GARVEY&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;No. 00-1210.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;United States Supreme Court.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided May 14, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*506&lt;/span&gt; Per Curiam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit here rejected an arbitrator's factual findings and then resolved the merits of the parties' dispute instead of remanding the case for further arbitration proceedings. Because the court's determination conflicts with our cases limiting review of an arbitrator's award entered pursuant to an agreement between an employer and a labor organization and prescribing the appropriate remedy where vacation of the award is warranted, we grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and reverse. The motions for leave to file briefs &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; of the National Academy of Arbitrators and the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball are granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1980's, petitioner Major League Baseball Players Association (Association) filed grievances against the Major League Baseball Clubs (Clubs), claiming the Clubs had colluded in the market for free-agent services after the 1985, 1986, and 1987 baseball seasons, in violation of the industry's collective-bargaining agreement. A free agent is a player who may contract with any Club, rather than one whose right to contract is restricted to a particular Club. In a &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*506&lt;/span&gt; series of decisions, arbitrators found collusion by the Clubs and damage to the players. The Association and Clubs subsequently entered into a Global Settlement Agreement (Agreement), pursuant to which the Clubs established a $280 million fund to be distributed to injured players. The Association also designed a "Framework" to evaluate the individual player's claims, and, applying that Framework, recommended distribution plans for claims relating to a particular season or seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Framework provided that players could seek an arbitrator's review of the distribution plan. The arbitrator would determine "`only whether the approved Framework and the criteria set forth therein have been properly applied in the proposed Distribution Plan.' " &lt;i&gt;Garvey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Roberts,&lt;/i&gt; 203 F. 3d 580, 583 (CA9 2000) &lt;i&gt;(Garvey I)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; The Framework set forth factors to be considered in evaluating players' claims, as well as specific requirements for lost contract-extension claims. Such claims were cognizable "`only in those cases where evidence exists that a specific offer of an extension was made by a club prior to collusion only to thereafter be withdrawn when the collusion scheme was initiated.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 584.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent Steve Garvey, a retired, highly regarded first baseman, submitted a claim for damages of approximately $3 million. He alleged that his contract with the San Diego Padres was not extended to the 1988 and 1989 seasons due to collusion. The Association rejected Garvey's claim in February 1996, because he presented no evidence that the Padres actually offered to extend his contract. Garvey objected, and an arbitration hearing was held. He testified that the Padres offered to extend his contract for the 1988 and 1989 seasons and then withdrew the offer after they began colluding with other teams. He presented a June 1996 letter from Ballard Smith, Padres' President and CEO from 1979 to 1987, stating that,before the end of the 1985 season, Smith offered to extend Garvey's contract through &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*507&lt;/span&gt; the 1989 season, but that the Padres refused to negotiate with Garvey thereafter due to collusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arbitrator denied Garvey's claim, after seeking additional documentation from the parties. In his award, he explained that "`[t]here exists . . . substantial doubt as to the credibility of the statements in the Smith letter.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 586. He noted the "stark contradictions" between the 1996 letter and Smith's testimony in the earlier arbitration proceedings regarding collusion, where Smith, like other owners, denied collusion and stated that the Padres simply were not interested in extending Garvey's contract. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; The arbitrator determined that, due to these contradictions, he "`must reject [Smith's] more recent assertion that Garvey did not receive [a contract] extension' " due to collusion, and found that Garvey had not shown a specific offer of extension. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; He concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"`The shadow cast over the credibility of the Smith testimony coupled with the absence of any other corroboration of the claim submitted by Garvey compels a finding that the Padres declined to extend his contract not because of the constraints of the collusion effort of the clubs but rather as a baseball judgment founded upon [Garvey's] age and recent injury history.' " &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garvey moved in Federal District Court to vacate the arbitrator's award, alleging that the arbitrator violated the Framework by denying his claim. The District Court denied the motion. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed by a divided vote. The court acknowledged that judicial review of an arbitrator's decision in a labor dispute is extremely limited. But it held that review of the merits of the arbitrator's award was warranted in this case, because the arbitrator "`dispensed his own brand of industrial justice.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 589. The court recognized that Smith's prior testimony with respect to collusion conflicted with the statements in his 1996 letter. But in the court's view, the arbitrator's &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*508&lt;/span&gt; refusal to credit Smith's letter was "inexplicable" and "border[ed] on the irrational," because a panel of arbitrators, chaired by the arbitrator involved here, had previously concluded that the owners' prior testimony was false. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 590. The court rejected the arbitrator's reliance on the absence of other corroborating evidence, attributing that fact to Smith and Garvey's direct negotiations. The court also found that the record provided "strong support" for the truthfulness of Smith's 1996 letter. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 591-592. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded with directions to vacate the award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Court then remanded the case to the arbitration panel for further hearings, and Garvey appealed. The Court of Appeals, again by a divided vote, explained that &lt;i&gt;Garvey I&lt;/i&gt; established that "the conclusion that Smith made Garvey an offer and subsequently withdrew it because of the collusion scheme was the only conclusion that the arbitrator could draw from the record in the proceedings." No. 00-56080, 2000 WL 1801383, *1 (CA9, Dec. 7, 2000) (unpublished), judgt. order reported at 243 F. 3d 547 &lt;i&gt;(Garvey II).&lt;/i&gt; Noting that its prior instructions might have been unclear, the court clarified that &lt;i&gt;Garvey I&lt;/i&gt; "left only one possible result&#151;the result our holding contemplated&#151;an award in Garvey's favor." 2000 WL 1801383, at *1. The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court and directed that it remand the case to the arbitration panel with instructions to enter an award for Garvey in the amount he claimed.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*509&lt;/span&gt; The parties do not dispute that this case arises under &#167; 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 156, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 185(a), as the controversy involves an assertion of rights under an agreement between an employer and a labor organization. Although Garvey's specific allegation is that the arbitrator violated the Framework for resolving players' claims for damages, that Framework was designed to facilitate payments to remedy the Clubs' breach of the collective-bargaining agreement. Garvey's right to be made whole is founded on that agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judicial review of a labor-arbitration decision pursuant to such an agreement is very limited. Courts are not authorized to review the arbitrator's decision on the merits despite allegations that the decision rests on factual errors or misinterprets the parties' agreement. &lt;i&gt;Paperworkers&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Misco, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 484 U. S. 29, 36 (1987). We recently reiterated that if an "`arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,' the fact that `a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.' " &lt;i&gt;Eastern Associated Coal Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mine Workers,&lt;/i&gt; 531 U. S. 57, 62 (2000) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Misco, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 38). It is only when the arbitrator strays from interpretation and application of the agreement and effectively "dispense[s] his own brand of industrial justice" that his decision may be unenforceable. &lt;i&gt;Steelworkers&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Enterprise Wheel &amp;amp; Car Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 363 U. S. 593, 597 (1960). When an arbitrator resolves disputes regarding the application of a contract, and no dishonesty is alleged, the arbitrator's "improvident, even silly, fact finding" does not provide a basis for a reviewing court to refuse to enforce the award. &lt;i&gt;Misco,&lt;/i&gt; 484 U. S., at 39.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In discussing the courts' limited role in reviewing the merits of arbitration awards, we have stated that "`courts . . . have no business weighing the merits of the grievance [or] considering whether there is equity in a particular claim.' " &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*510&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 37 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Steelworkers&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Mfg. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 363 U. S. 564, 568 (1960)). When the judiciary does so, "it usurps a function which . . . is entrusted to the arbitration tribunal." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 569; see also &lt;i&gt;Enterprise Wheel &amp;amp; Car Corp., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 599 ("It is the arbitrator's construction [of the agreement] which was bargained for . . ."). Consistent with this limited role, we said in &lt;i&gt;Misco&lt;/i&gt; that "[e]ven in the very rare instances when an arbitrator's procedural aberrations rise to the level of affirmative misconduct, as a rule the court must not foreclose further proceedings by settling the merits according to its own judgment of the appropriate result." 484 U. S., at 40-41, n. 10. That step, we explained, "would improperly substitute a judicial determination for the arbitrator's decision that the parties bargained for" in their agreement. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Instead, the court should "simply vacate the award, thus leaving open the possibility of further proceedings if they are permitted under the terms of the agreement." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the Court of Appeals here recited these principles, but its application of them is nothing short of baffling. The substance of the court's discussion reveals that it overturned the arbitrator's decision because it disagreed with the arbitrator's factual findings, particularly those with respect to credibility. The Court of Appeals, it appears, would have credited Smith's 1996 letter, and found the arbitrator's refusal to do so at worst "irrational" and at best "bizarre." &lt;i&gt;Garvey I,&lt;/i&gt; 203 F. 3d, at 590-591. But even "serious error" on the arbitrator's part does not justify overturning his decision, where, as here, he is construing a contract and acting within the scope of his authority. &lt;i&gt;Misco, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 38.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Garvey II,&lt;/i&gt; the court clarified that &lt;i&gt;Garvey I&lt;/i&gt; both rejected the arbitrator's findings and went further, resolving the merits of the parties' dispute based on the court's assessment of the record before the arbitrator. For that reason, the court found further arbitration proceedings inappropriate. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*511&lt;/span&gt; But again, established law ordinarily precludes a court from resolving the merits of the parties' dispute on the basis of its own factual determinations, no matter how erroneous the arbitrator's decision. &lt;i&gt;Misco, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 40, n. 10; see also &lt;i&gt;American Mfg. Co., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 568. Even when the arbitrator's award may properly be vacated, the appropriate remedy is to remand the case for further arbitration proceedings. &lt;i&gt;Misco, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 40, n. 10. The dissent suggests that the remedy described in &lt;i&gt;Misco&lt;/i&gt; is limited to cases where the arbitrator's errors are procedural. &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 512 (opinion of Stevens, J.). &lt;i&gt;Misco&lt;/i&gt; did involve procedural issues, but our discussion regarding the appropriate remedy was not so limited. If a remand is appropriate &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; when the arbitrator's award has been set aside for "procedural aberrations" that constitute "affirmative misconduct," it follows that a remand ordinarily will be appropriate when the arbitrator simply made factual findings that the reviewing court perceives as "irrational." The Court of Appeals usurped the arbitrator's role by resolving the dispute and barring further proceedings, a result at odds with this governing law.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the foregoing reasons, the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the order of the District Court denying the motion to vacate the arbitrator's award, and it erred further in directing that judgment be entered in Garvey's favor. The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the judgment of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*512&lt;/span&gt; the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Ginsburg, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with the Court that in &lt;i&gt;Garvey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Roberts,&lt;/i&gt; 203 F. 3d 580 (CA9 2000), the Ninth Circuit should not have disturbed the arbitrator's award. Correction of that error sets this case straight. I see no need to say more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well settled that an arbitrator "does not sit to dispense his own brand of industrial justice." &lt;i&gt;Steelworkers&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Enterprise Wheel &amp;amp; Car Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 363 U. S. 593, 597 (1960). We have also said fairly definitively, albeit in dicta, that a court should remedy an arbitrator's "procedural aberrations" by vacating the award and remanding for further proceedings. &lt;i&gt;Paperworkers&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Misco, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 484 U. S. 29, 40-41, n. 10 (1987). Our cases, however, do not provide significant guidance as to what standards a federal court should use in assessing whether an arbitrator's behavior is so untethered to either the agreement of the parties or the factual record so as to constitute an attempt to "dispense his own brand of industrial justice." Nor, more importantly, do they tell us how, having made such a finding, courts should deal with "the extraordinary circumstance in which the arbitrator's own rulings make clear that, more than being simply erroneous, his finding is completely inexplicable and borders on the irrational." &lt;i&gt;Garvey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Roberts,&lt;/i&gt; 203 F. 3d 580, 590 (CA9 2000) (case below). Because our case law is not sufficiently clear to allow me to conclude that the case below was wrongly decided&#151;let alone to conclude that the decision was so wrong as to require the extraordinary remedy of a summary &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*513&lt;/span&gt; reversal&#151;I dissent from the Court's disposition of this petition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the benefit of briefing or argument, today the Court resolves two difficult questions. First, it decides that even if the Court of Appeals' appraisal of the merits is correct&#151;that is to say, even if the arbitrator did dispense his own brand of justice untethered to the agreement of the parties, and even if the correct disposition of the matter is perfectly clear&#151;the only course open to a reviewing court is to remand the matter for another arbitration. That conclusion is not compelled by any of our cases, nor by any analysis offered by the Court. As the issue is subject to serious arguments on both sides, the Court should have set this case for argument if it wanted to answer this remedial question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, without reviewing the record or soliciting briefing, the Court concludes that, in any event, "no serious error on the arbitrator's part is apparent in this case." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 511, n. 2. At this stage in the proceedings, I simply cannot endorse that conclusion. After examining the record, obtaining briefing, and hearing oral argument, the Court of Appeals offered a reasoned explanation of its conclusion. See 203 F. 3d, at 589-592; see also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 593-594 (Hawkins, J., concurring). Whether or not I would ultimately agree with the Ninth Circuit's analysis, I find the Court's willingness to reverse a fact bound determination of the Court of Appeals without engaging that court's reasoning a troubling departure from our normal practice.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Garvey contends that, because the Association's petition was filed more than 90 days after &lt;i&gt;Garvey I,&lt;/i&gt; we cannot consider a challenge raising issues resolved in that decision. But there is no question that the Association's petition was filed in sufficient time for us to review &lt;i&gt;Garvey II,&lt;/i&gt; and we have authority to consider questions determined in earlier stages of the litigation where certiorari is sought from the most recent of the judgments of the Court of Appeals. &lt;i&gt;Mercer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Theriot,&lt;/i&gt; 377 U. S. 152 (1964) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wolf Brothers &amp;amp; Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 240 U. S. 251, 258 (1916).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  In any event, no serious error on the arbitrator's part is apparent in this case. The fact that an earlier panel of arbitrators rejected the owners' testimony as a whole does not compel the conclusion that the panel found Smith's specific statements with respect to Garvey to be false. The arbitrator's explanation for his decision indicates that he simply found Smith an unreliable witness and that, in the absence of corroborating evidence, he could only conclude that Garvey failed to show that the Padres had offered to extend his contract. The arbitrator's analysis may have been unpersuasive to the Court of Appeals, but his decision hardly qualifies as serious error, let alone irrational or inexplicable error. And, as we have said, any such error would not justify the actions taken by the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   The Court's opinion is somewhat ambiguous as to its reasons for overturning the portion of the Court of Appeals' decision setting aside the arbitration. It is unclear whether the majority is saying that a court may never set aside an arbitration because of a factual error, no matter how perverse, or whether the Court merely holds that the error in this case was not sufficiently severe to allow a court to take that step. If it is the latter, the Court offers no explanation of what standards it is using or of its reasons for reaching that conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cases raise an important question concerning what degree of protection, if any, the First Amendment provides to speech that discloses the contents of an illegally intercepted communication. That question is both novel and narrow. Despite the fact that federal law has prohibited such disclosures since 1934,&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; this is the first time that we have confronted such an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit at hand involves the repeated intentional disclosure of an illegally intercepted cellular telephone conversation about a public issue. The persons who made the disclosures did not participate in the interception, but they did know&#151;or at least had reason to know&#151;that the interception &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*518&lt;/span&gt; was unlawful. Accordingly, these cases present a conflict between interests of the highest order&#151;on the one hand, the interest in the full and free dissemination of information concerning public issues, and, on the other hand, the interest in individual privacy and, more specifically, in fostering private speech. The Framers of the First Amendment surely did not foresee the advances in science that produced the conversation, the interception, or the conflict that gave rise to this action. It is therefore not surprising that Circuit judges, as well as the Members of this Court, have come to differing conclusions about the First Amendment's application to this issue. Nevertheless, having considered the interests at stake, we are firmly convinced that the disclosures made by respondents in this suit are protected by the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 1992 and most of 1993, the Pennsylvania State Education Association, a union representing the teachers at the Wyoming Valley West High School, engaged in collectivebargaining negotiations with the school board. Petitioner Kane, then the president of the local union, testified that the negotiations were "`contentious' " and received "a lot of media attention." App. 79, 92. In May 1993, petitioner Bartnicki, who was acting as the union's "chief negotiator," used the cellular phone in her car to call Kane and engage in a lengthy conversation about the status of the negotiations. An unidentified person intercepted and recorded that call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their conversation, Kane and Bartnicki discussed the timing of a proposed strike, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 41-45, difficulties created by public comment on the negotiations, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 46, and the need for a dramatic response to the board's intransigence. At one point, Kane said: "`If they're not gonna move for three percent, we're gonna have to go to their, their &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*519&lt;/span&gt; homes . . . . To blow off their front porches, we'll have to do some work on some of those guys. (PAUSES). Really, uh, really and truthfully because this is, you know, this is bad news. (UNDECIPHERABLE).' " &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early fall of 1993, the parties accepted a nonbinding arbitration proposal that was generally favorable to the teachers. In connection with news reports about the settlement, respondent Vopper, a radio commentator who had been critical of the union in the past, played a tape of the intercepted conversation on his public affairs talk show. Another station also broadcast the tape, and local newspapers published its contents. After filing suit against Vopper and other representatives of the media, Bartnicki and Kane (hereinafter petitioners) learned through discovery that Vopper had obtained the tape from respondent Jack Yocum, the head of a local taxpayers' organization that had opposed the union's demands throughout the negotiations. Yocum, who was added as a defendant, testified that he had found the tape in his mailbox shortly after the interception and recognized the voices of Bartnicki and Kane. Yocum played the tape for some members of the school board, and later delivered the tape itself to Vopper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their amended complaint, petitioners alleged that their telephone conversation had been surreptitiously intercepted by an unknown person using an electronic device, that Yocum had obtained a tape of that conversation, and that he intentionally disclosed it to Vopper, as well as other individuals and media representatives. Thereafter, Vopper and other members of the media repeatedly published the contents of that conversation. The amended complaint alleged that each of the defendants "knew or had reason to know" that the recording of the private telephone conversation had been obtained by means of an illegal interception. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*520&lt;/span&gt; at 27. Relying on both federal and Pennsylvania statutory provisions, petitioners sought actual damages, statutory damages, punitive damages, and attorney's fees and costs.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the parties completed their discovery, they filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Respondents contended that they had not violated the statute because (a) they had nothing to do with the interception, and (b) in any event, their actions were not unlawful since the conversation might have been intercepted inadvertently. Moreover, even if they had violated the statute by disclosing the intercepted conversation, respondents argued, those disclosures were protected by the First Amendment. The District Court rejected the first statutory argument because, under the plain statutory language, an individual violates the federal Act by intentionally disclosing the contents of an electronic communication when he or she "know[s] or ha[s] reason to know that the information was obtained" through an illegal interception.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 99&#151; 1687, pp. 53a&#151;54a (emphasis deleted). Accordingly, actual involvement in the illegal interception is not necessary in order to establish a violation of that statute. With respect to the second statutory argument, the District Court agreed that petitioners had to prove that the interception in question &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*521&lt;/span&gt; was intentional,&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; but concluded that the text of the interception raised a genuine issue of material fact with respect to intent. That issue of fact was also the basis for the District Court's denial of petitioners' motion. Finally, the District Court rejected respondents' First Amendment defense because the statutes were content-neutral laws of general applicability that contained "no indicia of prior restraint or the chilling of free speech." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 55a&#151;56a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thereafter, the District Court granted a motion for an interlocutory appeal, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1292(b). It certified as controlling questions of law: "(1) whether the imposition of liability on the media Defendants under the [wiretapping statutes] solely for broadcasting the newsworthy tape on the Defendant [Vopper's] radio news/public affairs program, when the tape was illegally intercepted and recorded by unknown persons who were not agents of [the] Defendants, violates the First Amendment; and (2) whether imposition of liability under the aforesaid [wiretapping] statutes on Defendant Jack Yocum solely for providing the anonymously intercepted and recorded tape to the media Defendants violates the First Amendment." App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 99-1728, p. 76a. The Court of Appeals accepted the appeal, and the United States, also a petitioner, intervened pursuant to 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2403 in order to defend the constitutionality of the federal statute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three members of the panel agreed with petitioners and the Government that the federal and Pennsylvania wiretapping statutes are "content-neutral" and therefore subject to "intermediate scrutiny." 200 F. 3d 109, 121 (CA3 1999). Applying that standard, the majority concluded that the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*522&lt;/span&gt; statutes were invalid because they deterred significantly more speech than necessary to protect the privacy interests at stake. The court remanded the case with instructions to enter summary judgment for respondents. In dissent, Senior Judge Pollak expressed the view that the prohibition against disclosures was necessary in order to remove the incentive for illegal interceptions and to preclude compounding the harm caused by such interceptions through wider dissemination. In so doing, he agreed with the majority opinion in a similar case decided by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, &lt;i&gt;Boehner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McDermott,&lt;/i&gt; 191 F. 3d 463 (1999). See also &lt;i&gt;Peavy&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;WFAA&#151;TV, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 221 F. 3d 158 (CA5 2000).&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 530 U. S. 1260 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we pointed out in &lt;i&gt;Berger&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York,&lt;/i&gt; 388 U. S. 41, 45-49 (1967), sophisticated (and not so sophisticated) methods of eavesdropping on oral conversations and intercepting telephone calls have been practiced for decades, primarily by law enforcement authorities.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Berger,&lt;/i&gt; we held that New &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*523&lt;/span&gt; York's broadly written statute authorizing the police to conduct wiretaps violated the Fourth Amendment. Largely in response to that decision, and to our holding in &lt;i&gt;Katz&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 389 U. S. 347 (1967), that the attachment of a listening and recording device to the outside of a telephone booth constituted a search, "Congress undertook to draft comprehensive legislation both authorizing the use of evidence obtained by electronic surveillance on specified conditions, and prohibiting its use otherwise. S. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 66 (1968)." &lt;i&gt;Gelbard&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt;  408 U. S. 41, 78 (1972) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). The ultimate result of those efforts was Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 82 Stat. 211, entitled Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the stated purposes of that title was "to protect effectively the privacy of wire and oral communications." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; In addition to authorizing and regulating electronic surveillance for law enforcement purposes, Title III also regulated private conduct. One part of those regulations, &#167; 2511(1), defined five offenses punishable by a fine of not more than $10,000, by imprisonment for not more than five years, or by both. Subsection (a) applied to any person who "willfully intercepts . . . any wire or oral communication." Subsection (b) applied to the intentional use of devices designed to intercept oral conversations; subsection (d) applied to the use of the contents of illegally intercepted wire or &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*524&lt;/span&gt; oral communications; and subsection (e) prohibited the unauthorized disclosure of the contents of interceptions that were authorized for law enforcement purposes. Subsection (c), the original version of the provision most directly at issue in this suit, applied to any person who "willfully discloses, or endeavors to disclose, to any other person the contents of any wire or oral communication, knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of a wire or oral communication in violation of this subsection." The oral communications protected by the Act were only those "uttered by a person exhibiting an expectation that such communication is not subject to interception under circumstances justifying such expectation." &#167; 2510(2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As enacted in 1968, Title III did not apply to the monitoring of radio transmissions. In the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 1848, however, Congress enlarged the coverage of Title III to prohibit the interception of "electronic" as well as oral and wire communications. By reason of that amendment, as well as a 1994 amendment which applied to cordless telephone communications, 108 Stat. 4279, Title III now applies to the interception of conversations over both cellular and cordless phones.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; Although a lesser criminal penalty may apply to the interception of such transmissions, the same civil remedies are available whether the communication was "oral," "wire," or "electronic," as defined by 18 U. S. C. &#167; 2510 (1994 ed. and Supp. V).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constitutional question before us concerns the validity of the statutes as applied to the specific facts of these cases. Because of the procedural posture of these cases, it is appropriate to make certain important assumptions about those &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*525&lt;/span&gt; facts. We accept petitioners' submission that the interception was intentional, and therefore unlawful, and that, at a minimum, respondents "had reason to know" that it was unlawful. Accordingly, the disclosure of the contents of the intercepted conversation by Yocum to school board members and to representatives of the media, as well as the subsequent disclosures by the media defendants to the public, violated the federal and state statutes. Under the provisions of the federal statute, as well as its Pennsylvania analogue, petitioners are thus entitled to recover damages from each of the respondents. The only question is whether the application of these statutes in such circumstances violates the First Amendment.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In answering that question, we accept respondents' submission on three factual matters that serve to distinguish most of the cases that have arisen under &#167; 2511. First, respondents played no part in the illegal interception. Rather, they found out about the interception only after it occurred, and in fact never learned the identity of the person or persons who made the interception. Second, their access to the information on the tapes was obtained lawfully, even though the information itself was intercepted unlawfully by someone else. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Florida Star&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;B. J. F.,&lt;/i&gt; 491 U. S. 524, 536 (1989) ("Even assuming the Constitution permitted a State to proscribe &lt;i&gt;receipt&lt;/i&gt; of information, Florida has not taken this step"). Third, the subject matter of the conversation was a matter of public concern. If the statements about the labor negotiations had been made in a public arena&#151;during a bargaining session, for example&#151;they would have been newsworthy. This would also be true if a third party had inadvertently overheard Bartnicki making the same statements to Kane when the two thought they were alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*526&lt;/span&gt; V&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We agree with petitioners that &#167; 2511(1)(c), as well as its Pennsylvania analog, is in fact a content-neutral law of general applicability. "Deciding whether a particular regulation is content based or content neutral is not always a simple task. . . . As a general rule, laws that by their terms distinguish favored speech from disfavored speech on the basis of the ideas or views expressed are content based." &lt;i&gt;Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;FCC,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S. 622, 642-643 (1994). In determining whether a regulation is content based or content neutral, we look to the purpose behind the regulation; typically, "[g]overnment regulation of expressive activity is content neutral so long as it is `&lt;i&gt;justified&lt;/i&gt; without reference to the content of the regulated speech.' " &lt;i&gt;Ward&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rock Against Racism,&lt;/i&gt; 491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989).&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this suit, the basic purpose of the statute at issue is to "protec[t] the privacy of wire[, electronic,] and oral communications." S. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 66 (1968). The statute does not distinguish based on the content of the intercepted conversations, nor is it justified by reference to the content of those conversations. Rather, the communications at issue are singled out by virtue of the fact that they were illegally intercepted&#151;by virtue of the source, rather than the subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the naked prohibition against disclosures is fairly characterized as a regulation of pure speech. Unlike the prohibition against the "use" of the contents of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*527&lt;/span&gt; an illegal interception in &#167; 2511(1)(d),&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; subsection (c) is not a regulation of conduct. It is true that the delivery of a tape recording might be regarded as conduct, but given that the purpose of such a delivery is to provide the recipient with the text of recorded statements, it is like the delivery of a handbill or a pamphlet, and as such, it is the kind of "speech" that the First Amendment protects.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; As the majority below put it, "[i]f the acts of `disclosing' and `publishing' information do not constitute speech, it is hard to imagine what does fall within that category, as distinct from the category of expressive conduct." 200 F. 3d, at 120.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;VI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general matter, "state action to punish the publication of truthful information seldom can satisfy constitutional standards." &lt;i&gt;Smith&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail Publishing Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 443 U. S. 97, 102 (1979). More specifically, this Court has repeatedly &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*528&lt;/span&gt; held that "if a newspaper lawfully obtains truthful information about a matter of public significance then state officials may not constitutionally punish publication of the information, absent a need . . . of the highest order." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 103; see also &lt;i&gt;Florida Star&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;B. J. F.,&lt;/i&gt; 491 U. S. 524 (1989); &lt;i&gt;Landmark Communications, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Virginia,&lt;/i&gt; 435 U. S. 829 (1978).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, in &lt;i&gt;New York Times Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 403 U. S. 713 (1971) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; the Court upheld the right of the press to publish information of great public concern obtained from documents stolen by a third party. In so doing, that decision resolved a conflict between the basic rule against prior restraints on publication and the interest in preserving the secrecy of information that, if disclosed, might seriously impair the security of the Nation. In resolving that conflict, the attention of every Member of this Court was focused on the character of the stolen documents' contents and the consequences of public disclosure. Although the undisputed fact that the newspaper intended to publish information obtained from stolen documents was noted in Justice Harlan's dissent, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 754, neither the majority nor the dissenters placed any weight on that fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; raised, but did not resolve, the question "whether, in cases where information has been acquired &lt;i&gt;unlawfully&lt;/i&gt; by a newspaper or by a source, government may ever punish not only the unlawful acquisition, but the ensuing publication as well."&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Florida Star,&lt;/i&gt; 491 U. S., at 535, n. 8. The question here, however, is a narrower version of that still-open question. Simply put, the issue here is this: "Where the punished publisher of information has obtained the information in question in a manner lawful in itself but from a source who has obtained it unlawfully, may the government punish the ensuing publication of that information based on the defect in a chain?" &lt;i&gt;Boehner,&lt;/i&gt; 191 F. 3d, at 484-485 (Sentelle, J., dissenting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*529&lt;/span&gt; Our refusal to construe the issue presented more broadly is consistent with this Court's repeated refusal to answer categorically whether truthful publication may ever be punished consistent with the First Amendment. Rather,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[o]ur cases have carefully eschewed reaching this ultimate question, mindful that the future may bring scenarios which prudence counsels our not resolving anticipatorily. . . . We continue to believe that the sensitivity and significance of the interests presented in clashes between [the] First Amendment and privacy rights counsel relying on limited principles that sweep no more broadly than the appropriate context of the instant case." &lt;i&gt;Flor-&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;ida Star,&lt;/i&gt; 491 U. S., at 532-533. See also &lt;i&gt;Landmark Communications,&lt;/i&gt; 435 U. S., at 838. Accordingly, we consider whether, given the facts of these cases, the interests served by &#167; 2511(1)(c) can justify its restrictions on speech.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government identifies two interests served by the statute&#151;first, the interest in removing an incentive for parties to intercept private conversations, and second, the interest in minimizing the harm to persons whose conversations have been illegally intercepted. We assume that those interests adequately justify the prohibition in &#167; 2511(1)(d) against the interceptor's own use of information that he or she acquired by violating &#167; 2511(1)(a), but it by no means follows that punishing disclosures of lawfully obtained information of public interest by one not involved in the initial illegality is an acceptable means of serving those ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The normal method of deterring unlawful conduct is to impose an appropriate punishment on the person who engages in it. If the sanctions that presently attach to a violation of &#167; 2511(1)(a) do not provide sufficient deterrence, perhaps those sanctions should be made more severe. But it would be quite remarkable to hold that speech by a law-abiding possessor of information can be suppressed in order to deter &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*530&lt;/span&gt; conduct by a non-law-abiding third party. Although there are some rare occasions in which a law suppressing one party's speech may be justified by an interest in deterring criminal conduct by another, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ferber,&lt;/i&gt; 458 U. S. 747 (1982),&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt; this is not such a case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only a handful of exceptions, the violations of &#167; 2511(1)(a) that have been described in litigated cases have been motivated by either financial gain or domestic disputes.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; In virtually all of those cases, the identity of the person or persons intercepting the communication has been known.&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt; Moreover, petitioners cite no evidence that Congress viewed the prohibition against disclosures as a response to the difficulty of identifying persons making improper use of scanners and other surveillance devices and accordingly of deterring such conduct,&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt; and there is no &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*531&lt;/span&gt; empirical evidence to support the assumption that the prohibition against disclosures reduces the number of illegal interceptions.&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this suit demonstrates that there may be an occasional situation in which an anonymous scanner will risk criminal prosecution by passing on information without any expectation of financial reward or public praise, surely this is the exceptional case. Moreover, there is no basis for assuming that imposing sanctions upon respondents will deter the unidentified scanner from continuing to engage in surreptitious interceptions. Unusual cases fall far short of a &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*532&lt;/span&gt; showing that there is a "need . . . of the highest order" for a rule supplementing the traditional means of deterring antisocial conduct. The justification for any such novel burden on expression must be "far stronger than mere speculation about serious harms." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Treasury Employees,&lt;/i&gt; 513 U. S. 454, 475 (1995).&lt;sup&gt;[18]&lt;/sup&gt; Accordingly, the Government's first suggested justification for applying &#167; 2511(1)(c) to an otherwise innocent disclosure of public information is plainly insufficient.&lt;sup&gt;[19]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government's second argument, however, is considerably stronger. Privacy of communication is an important interest, &lt;i&gt;Harper &amp;amp; Row, Publishers, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Nation Enterprises,&lt;/i&gt; 471 U. S. 539, 559 (1985),&lt;sup&gt;[20]&lt;/sup&gt; and Title III's restrictions are intended to protect that interest, thereby "encouraging the uninhibited exchange of ideas and information among private parties . . . ." Brief for United States 27. Moreover, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*533&lt;/span&gt; the fear of public disclosure of private conversations might well have a chilling effect on private speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In a democratic society privacy of communication is essential if citizens are to think and act creatively and constructively. Fear or suspicion that one's speech is being monitored by a stranger, even without the reality of such activity, can have a seriously inhibiting effect upon the willingness to voice critical and constructive ideas." President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society 202 (1967). Accordingly, it seems to us that there are important interests to be considered on &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; sides of the constitutional calculus. In considering that balance, we acknowledge that some intrusions on privacy are more offensive than others, and that the disclosure of the contents of a private conversation can be an even greater intrusion on privacy than the interception itself. As a result, there is a valid independent justification for prohibiting such disclosures by persons who lawfully obtained access to the contents of an illegally intercepted message, even if that prohibition does not play a significant role in preventing such interceptions from occurring in the first place.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need not decide whether that interest is strong enough to justify the application of &#167; 2511(c) to disclosures of trade secrets or domestic gossip or other information of purely private concern. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Time, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hill,&lt;/i&gt; 385 U. S. 374, 387-388 (1967) (reserving the question whether truthful publication of private matters unrelated to public affairs can be constitutionally proscribed). In other words, the outcome of these cases does not turn on whether &#167; 2511(1)(c) may be enforced with respect to most violations of the statute without offending the First Amendment. The enforcement of that provision in these cases, however, implicates the core purposes &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*534&lt;/span&gt; of the First Amendment because it imposes sanctions on the publication of truthful information of public concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these cases, privacy concerns give way when balanced against the interest in publishing matters of public importance. As Warren and Brandeis stated in their classic law review article: "The right of privacy does not prohibit any publication of matter which is of public or general interest." The Right to Privacy, 4 Harv. L. Rev. 193, 214 (1890). One of the costs associated with participation in public affairs is an attendant loss of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Exposure of the self to others in varying degrees is a concomitant of life in a civilized community. The risk of this exposure is an essential incident of life in a society which places a primary value on freedom of speech and of press. `Freedom of discussion, if it would fulfill its historic function in this nation, must embrace all issues about which information is needed or appropriate to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of their period.' " &lt;i&gt;Time, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hill,&lt;/i&gt; 385 U. S., at 388 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Thornhill&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Alabama,&lt;/i&gt; 310 U. S. 88, 102 (1940)).&lt;sup&gt;[21]&lt;/sup&gt; Our opinion in &lt;i&gt;New York Times Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sullivan,&lt;/i&gt; 376 U. S. 254 (1964), reviewed many of the decisions that settled the "general proposition that freedom of expression upon public questions is secured by the First Amendment." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 269; see &lt;i&gt;Roth&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 354 U. S. 476, 484 (1957); &lt;i&gt;Bridges&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;California,&lt;/i&gt; 314 U. S. 252, 270 (1941); &lt;i&gt;Stromberg&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;California,&lt;/i&gt; 283 U. S. 359, 369 (1931). Those cases all relied on our "profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open," &lt;i&gt;New York Times,&lt;/i&gt; 376 U. S., at 270; see &lt;i&gt;Terminiello&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chicago,&lt;/i&gt; 337 U. S. 1, 4 (1949); &lt;i&gt;De Jonge&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Oregon,&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*535&lt;/span&gt; 299 U. S. 353, 365 (1937); &lt;i&gt;Whitney&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;California,&lt;/i&gt; 274 U. S. 357, 375-376 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring); see also &lt;i&gt;Roth,&lt;/i&gt;  354 U. S., at 484; &lt;i&gt;Stromberg,&lt;/i&gt; 283 U. S., at 369; &lt;i&gt;Bridges,&lt;/i&gt; 314 U. S., at 270. It was the overriding importance of that commitment that supported our holding that neither factual error nor defamatory content, nor a combination of the two, sufficed to remove the First Amendment shield from criticism of official conduct. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 273; see also &lt;i&gt;NAACP&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Button,&lt;/i&gt; 371 U. S. 415, 445 (1963); &lt;i&gt;Wood&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia,&lt;/i&gt; 370 U. S. 375 (1962); &lt;i&gt;Craig&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Harney,&lt;/i&gt; 331 U. S. 367 (1947); &lt;i&gt;Pennekamp&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Florida,&lt;/i&gt; 328 U. S. 331, 342, 343, n. 5, 345 (1946); &lt;i&gt;Bridges,&lt;/i&gt; 314 U. S., at 270.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think it clear that parallel reasoning requires the conclusion that a stranger's illegal conduct does not suffice to remove the First Amendment shield from speech about a matter of public concern.&lt;sup&gt;[22]&lt;/sup&gt; The months of negotiations over the proper level of compensation for teachers at the Wyoming Valley West High School were unquestionably a matter of public concern, and respondents were clearly engaged in debate about that concern. That debate may be more mundane than the Communist rhetoric that inspired Justice Brandeis' classic opinion in &lt;i&gt;Whitney&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;California,&lt;/i&gt; 274 U. S., at 372, but it is no less worthy of constitutional protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment is affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt;  Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor joins, concurring.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I join the Court's opinion. I agree with its narrow holding limited to the special circumstances present here: (1) the radio broadcasters acted lawfully (up to the time of final public disclosure); and (2) the information publicized involved &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*536&lt;/span&gt; a matter of unusual public concern, namely, a threat of potential physical harm to others. I write separately to explain why, in my view, the Court's holding does not imply a significantly broader constitutional immunity for the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Court recognizes, the question before us&#151;a question of immunity from statutorily imposed civil liability&#151; implicates competing constitutional concerns. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 532&#151; 533. The statutes directly interfere with free expression in that they prevent the media from publishing information. At the same time, they help to protect personal privacy&#151;an interest here that includes not only the "right to be let alone," &lt;i&gt;Olmstead&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 277 U. S. 438, 478 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting), but also "the interest . . . in fostering private speech," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 518. Given these competing interests "on both sides of the equation, the key question becomes one of proper fit." &lt;i&gt;Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;FCC,&lt;/i&gt; 520 U. S. 180, 227 (1997) (Breyer, J., concurring in part). See also &lt;i&gt;Nixon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Shrink Missouri Government PAC,&lt;/i&gt; 528 U. S. 377, 402 (2000) (Breyer, J., concurring).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would ask whether the statutes strike a reasonable balance between their speech-restricting and speech-enhancing consequences. Or do they instead impose restrictions on speech that are disproportionate when measured against their corresponding privacy and speech-related benefits, taking into account the kind, the importance, and the extent of these benefits, as well as the need for the restrictions in order to secure those benefits? What this Court has called "strict scrutiny"&#151;with its strong presumption against constitutionality&#151;is normally out of place where, as here, important competing constitutional interests are implicated. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 518 (recognizing "conflict between interests of the highest order"); &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 533 ("important interests to be considered on &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; sides of the constitutional calculus"); &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt;  at 534 ("balanc[ing]" the interest in privacy "against the interest &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*537&lt;/span&gt; in publishing matters of public importance"); &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 534 (privacy interest outweighed in these cases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statutory restrictions before us directly enhance private speech. See &lt;i&gt;Harper &amp;amp; Row, Publishers, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Nation Enterprises,&lt;/i&gt; 471 U. S. 539, 559 (1985) (describing "`freedom &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to speak publicly' " (quoting &lt;i&gt;Estate of Hemingway&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Random House, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 23 N. Y. 2d 341, 348, 244 N. E. 2d 250, 255 (1968))). The statutes ensure the privacy of telephone conversations much as a trespass statute ensures privacy within the home. That assurance of privacy helps to overcome our natural reluctance to discuss private matters when we fear that our private conversations may become public. And the statutory restrictions consequently encourage conversations that otherwise might not take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, these statutes restrict public speech directly, deliberately, and of necessity. They include media publication within their scope not simply as a means, say, to deter interception, but also as an end. Media dissemination of an intimate conversation to an entire community will often cause the speakers serious harm over and above the harm caused by an initial disclosure to the person who intercepted the phone call. See &lt;i&gt;Gelbard&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt;  408 U. S. 41, 51-52 (1972). And the threat of that widespread dissemination can create a far more powerful disincentive to speak privately than the comparatively minor threat of disclosure to an interceptor and perhaps to a handful of others. Insofar as these statutes protect private communications against that widespread dissemination, they resemble laws that would award damages caused through publication of information obtained by theft from a private bedroom. See generally Warren &amp;amp; Brandeis, The Right to Privacy, 4 Harv. L. Rev. 193 (1890) (hereinafter Warren &amp;amp; Brandeis). See also Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; &lt;i&gt;652D&lt;/i&gt; (1977).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general matter, despite the statutes' direct restrictions on speech, the Federal Constitution must tolerate &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*538&lt;/span&gt; laws of this kind because of the importance of these privacy and speech-related objectives. See Warren &amp;amp; Brandeis 196 (arguing for state-law protection of the right to privacy). Cf. &lt;i&gt;Katz&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 389 U. S. 347, 350-351 (1967) ("[T]he protection of a person's &lt;i&gt;general&lt;/i&gt; right to privacy&#151;his right to be let alone by other people&#151;is, like the protection of his property and of his very life, left largely to the law of the individual States"); &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 518 (protecting privacy and promoting speech are "interests of the highest order"). Rather than broadly forbid this kind of legislative enactment, the Constitution demands legislative efforts to tailor the laws in order reasonably to reconcile media freedom with personal, speech-related privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, looked at more specifically, the statutes, as applied in these circumstances, do not reasonably reconcile the competing constitutional objectives. Rather, they disproportionately interfere with media freedom. For one thing, the broadcasters here engaged in no unlawful activity other than the ultimate publication of the information another had previously obtained. They "neither encouraged nor participated directly or indirectly in the interception." App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 99-1687, p. 33a. See also &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt;  at 525. No one claims that they ordered, counseled, encouraged, or otherwise aided or abetted the interception, the later delivery of the tape by the interceptor to an intermediary, or the tape's still later delivery by the intermediary to the media. Cf. 18 U. S. C. &#167; 2 (criminalizing aiding and abetting any federal offense); 2 W. LaFave &amp;amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law &#167;&#167; 6.6(b)&#151;(c), pp. 128-129 (1986) (describing criminal liability for aiding and abetting). And, as the Court points out, the statutes do not forbid the receipt of the tape itself. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 525. The Court adds that its holding "does not apply to punishing parties for obtaining the relevant information &lt;i&gt;unlawfully.&lt;/i&gt; " &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 532, n. 19 (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*539&lt;/span&gt; For another thing, the speakers had little or no &lt;i&gt;legitimate&lt;/i&gt;  interest in maintaining the privacy of the particular conversation. That conversation involved a suggestion about "blow[ing] off . . . front porches" and "do[ing] some work on some of those guys," App. 46, thereby raising a significant concern for the safety of others. Where publication of private information constitutes a wrongful act, the law recognizes a privilege allowing the reporting of threats to public safety. See Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 595, Comment &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; (1977) (general privilege to report that "another intends to kill or rob or commit some other serious crime against a third person"); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; &#167; 652G (privilege applies to invasion of privacy tort). Cf. Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition &#167; 40, Comment &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; (1995) (trade secret law permits disclosures relevant to public health or safety, commission of crime or tort, or other matters of substantial public concern); &lt;i&gt;Lachman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sperry-Sun Well Surveying Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 457 F. 2d 850, 853 (CA10 1972) (nondisclosure agreement not binding in respect to criminal activity); &lt;i&gt;Tarasoff&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Regents of Univ. of Cal.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/cal/72ta/tarasoff-v-regents-of-university-of-california/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Cal. 3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;425&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 436, 551 P. 2d 334, 343-344 (1976) (psychiatric privilege not binding in presence of danger to self or others). Even where the danger may have passed by the time of publication, that fact cannot legitimize the speaker's earlier privacy expectation. Nor should editors, who must make a publication decision quickly, have to determine present or continued danger before publishing this kind of threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the speakers themselves, the president of a teacher's union and the union's chief negotiator, were "limited public figures," for they voluntarily engaged in a public controversy. They thereby subjected themselves to somewhat greater public scrutiny and had a lesser interest in privacy than an individual engaged in purely private affairs. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 535 (respondents were engaged in matter of public concern); &lt;i&gt;Wolston&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Reader's Digest Assn., Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 443 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*540&lt;/span&gt; U. S. 157, 164 (1979); &lt;i&gt;Hutchinson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Proxmire,&lt;/i&gt; 443 U. S. 111, 134 (1979); &lt;i&gt;Gertz&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Robert Welch, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 418 U. S. 323, 351 (1974). See also Warren &amp;amp; Brandeis 215.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that the Constitution requires anyone, including public figures, to give up entirely the right to private communication, &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; communication free from telephone taps or interceptions. But the subject matter of the conversation at issue here is far removed from that in situations where the media publicizes truly private matters. See &lt;i&gt;Michaels&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Internet Entertainment Group, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/cacd/cZXB/michaels-v-internet-entertainment-group-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;823&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 841-842 (CD Cal. 1998) (broadcast of videotape recording of sexual relations between famous actress and rock star not a matter of legitimate public concern); W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp;amp; D. Owen, Prosser &amp;amp; Keeton on Law of Torts &#167; 117, p. 857 (5th ed. 1984) (stating that there is little expectation of privacy in mundane facts about a person's life, but that "portrayal of . . . intimate private characteristics or conduct" is "quite a different matter"); Warren &amp;amp; Brandeis 214 (recognizing that in certain matters "the community has no legitimate concern"). Cf. &lt;i&gt;Time, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Firestone,&lt;/i&gt; 424 U. S. 448, 454-455 (1976) (despite interest of public, divorce of wealthy person not a "public controversy"). Cf. also &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 533 ("[S]ome intrusions on privacy are more offensive than others").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, in finding a constitutional privilege to publish unlawfully intercepted conversations of the kind here at issue, the Court does not create a "public interest" exception that swallows up the statutes' privacy-protecting general rule. Rather, it finds constitutional protection for publication of intercepted information of a special kind. Here, the speakers' legitimate privacy expectations are unusually low, and the public interest in defeating those expectations is unusually high. Given these circumstances, along with the lawful nature of respondents' behavior, the statutes' enforcement would disproportionately harm media freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*541&lt;/span&gt; I emphasize the particular circumstances before us because, in my view, the Constitution permits legislatures to respond flexibly to the challenges future technology may pose to the individual's interest in basic personal privacy. Clandestine and pervasive invasions of privacy, unlike the simple theft of documents from a bedroom, are genuine possibilities as a result of continuously advancing technologies. Eavesdropping on ordinary cellular phone conversations in the street (which many callers seem to tolerate) is a very different matter from eavesdropping on encrypted cellular phone conversations or those carried on in the bedroom. But the technologies that allow the former may come to permit the latter. And statutes that may seem less important in the former context may turn out to have greater importance in the latter. Legislatures also may decide to revisit statutes such as those before us, creating better tailored provisions designed to encourage, for example, more effective privacy-protecting technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, we should avoid adopting overly broad or rigid constitutional rules, which would unnecessarily restrict legislative flexibility. I consequently agree with the Court's holding that the statutes as applied here violate the Constitution, but I would not extend that holding beyond these present circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology now permits millions of important and confidential conversations to occur through a vast system of electronic networks. These advances, however, raise significant privacy concerns. We are placed in the uncomfortable position of not knowing who might have access to our personal and business e-mails, our medical and financial records, or our cordless and cellular telephone conversations. In an attempt to prevent some of the most egregious violations of privacy, the United States, the District of Columbia, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*542&lt;/span&gt; and 40 States have enacted laws prohibiting the intentional interception and knowing disclosure of electronic communications.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The Court holds that all of these statutes violate the First Amendment insofar as the illegally intercepted conversation touches upon a matter of "public concern," an amorphous concept that the Court does not even attempt to define. But the Court's decision diminishes, rather than enhances, the purposes of the First Amendment, thereby chilling the speech of the millions of Americans who rely upon electronic technology to communicate each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 30 years ago, with Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Congress recognized that the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"tremendous scientific and technological developments that have taken place in the last century have made possible today the widespread use and abuse of electronic &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*543&lt;/span&gt; surveillance techniques. As a result of these developments, privacy of communication is seriously jeopardized by these techniques of surveillance. . . . No longer is it possible, in short, for each man to retreat into his home and be left alone. Every spoken word relating to each man's personal, marital, religious, political, or commercial concerns can be intercepted by an unseen auditor and turned against the speaker to the auditor's advantage." S. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 67 (1968) (hereinafter S. Rep. No. 1097). This concern for privacy was inseparably bound up with the desire that personal conversations be frank and uninhibited, not cramped by fears of clandestine surveillance and purposeful disclosure:&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In a democratic society privacy of communication is essential if citizens are to think and act creatively and constructively. Fear or suspicion that one's speech is being monitored by a stranger, even without the reality of such activity, can have a seriously inhibiting effect upon the willingness to voice critical and constructive ideas." President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society 202 (1967). To effectuate these important privacy and speech interests, Congress and the vast majority of States have proscribed the intentional interception and knowing disclosure of the contents of electronic communications.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 18 U. S. C. &#167; 2511(1)(c) (placing restrictions upon "any person who . . . intentionally discloses, or endeavors to disclose, to any other person the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*544&lt;/span&gt; knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication").&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court correctly observes that these are "contentneutral law[s] of general applicability" which serve recognized interests of the "highest order": "the interest in individual privacy and . . . in fostering private speech." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt;  at 526, 518. It nonetheless subjects these laws to the strict scrutiny normally reserved for governmental attempts to censor different viewpoints or ideas. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 532 (holding that petitioners have not established the requisite "`need. . . of the highest order' ") (quoting &lt;i&gt;Smith&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail Publishing Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 443 U. S. 97, 103 (1979)). There is scant support, either in precedent or in reason, for the Court's tacit application of strict scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A content-neutral regulation will be sustained if "`it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest; if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression; and if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.' " &lt;i&gt;Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;FCC,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S. 622, 662 (1994) (quoting &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;O'Brien,&lt;/i&gt; 391 U. S. 367, 377 (1968)). Here, Congress and the Pennsylvania Legislature have acted "`without reference to the content of the regulated speech.' " &lt;i&gt;Renton&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Playtime Theatres, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 475 U. S. 41, 48 (1986). There is no intimation that these laws seek "to suppress unpopular ideas or information or manipulate the public debate" or that they "distinguish favored speech from disfavored speech on the basis of the ideas or views expressed." &lt;i&gt;Turner Broadcasting, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 641, 643. The anti disclosure provision is based solely upon the manner in which the conversation was acquired, not the subject matter of the conversation or the viewpoints of the speakers. The same &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*545&lt;/span&gt; information, if obtained lawfully, could be published with impunity. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Seattle Times Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rhinehart,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 20, 34 (1984) (upholding under intermediate scrutiny a protective order on information acquired during discovery in part because "the party may disseminate the identical information . . . as long as the information is gained through means independent of the court's processes"). As the concerns motivating strict scrutiny are absent, these contentneutral restrictions upon speech need pass only intermediate scrutiny.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court's attempt to avoid these precedents by reliance upon the &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt; string of newspaper cases is unpersuasive. In these cases, we held that statutes prohibiting the media from publishing certain truthful information&#151;the name of a rape victim, &lt;i&gt;Florida Star&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;B. J. F.,&lt;/i&gt; 491 U. S. 524 (1989); &lt;i&gt;Cox Broadcasting Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cohn,&lt;/i&gt; 420 U. S. 469 (1975), the confidential proceedings before a state judicial review commission, &lt;i&gt;Landmark Communications, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Virginia,&lt;/i&gt;  435 U. S. 829 (1978), and the name of a juvenile defendant, &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oklahoma Publishing Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;District Court, Oklahoma Cty.,&lt;/i&gt; 430 U. S. 308 (1977) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; &#151; violated the First Amendment. In so doing, we stated that "if a newspaper lawfully obtains truthful information about a matter of public significance then state officials may not constitutionally punish publication of the information, absent a need to further a state interest of the highest order." &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 103. Neither this &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt; principle nor any other aspect of these cases, however, justifies the Court's imposition of strict scrutiny here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the laws at issue in the &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt; cases regulated the content or subject matter of speech. This fact alone was enough to trigger strict scrutiny, see &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S. 803, 813 (2000) ("[A] content-based speech restriction . . . can stand only if it satisfies strict scrutiny"), and suffices to distinguish these anti disclosure provisions. But, as our synthesis of these &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*546&lt;/span&gt; cases in &lt;i&gt;Florida Star&lt;/i&gt; made clear, three other unique factors also informed the scope of the &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt; principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the information published by the newspapers had been lawfully obtained from the government itself.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; "Where information is entrusted to the government, a less drastic means than punishing truthful publication almost always exists for guarding against the dissemination of private facts." &lt;i&gt;Florida Star, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 534. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Landmark Communications, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 841, and n. 12 (noting that the State could have taken steps to protect the confidentiality of its proceedings, such as holding in contempt commission members who breached their duty of confidentiality). Indeed, the State's ability to control the information undermined the claim that the restriction was necessary, for "[b]y placing the information in the public domain on official court records, the State must be presumed to have concluded that the public interest was thereby being served." &lt;i&gt;Cox Broadcasting, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 495. This factor has no relevance in the present cases, where we deal with private conversations that have been intentionally kept out of the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the information in each case was already "publicly available," and punishing further dissemination would not have advanced the purported government interests of confidentiality. &lt;i&gt;Florida Star, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 535. Such is not the case here. These statutes only prohibit "disclos[ure]," 18 U. S. C. &#167; 2511(1)(c); 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &#167; 5703(2) (2000), and one cannot "disclose" what is already in the public domain. See Black's Law Dictionary 477 (7th ed. 1999) (defining "disclosure" as "[t]he act or process of making known something that was previously unknown; a revelation of facts"); &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*547&lt;/span&gt; S. Rep. No. 1097, at 93 ("The disclosure of the contents of an intercepted communication that had already become `public information' or `common knowledge' would not be prohibited"). These laws thus do not fall under the axiom that "the interests in privacy fade when the information involved already appears on the public record." &lt;i&gt;Cox Broadcasting, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 494-495.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, these cases were concerned with "the `timidity and self-censorship' which may result from allowing the media to be punished for publishing certain truthful information." &lt;i&gt;Florida Star,&lt;/i&gt; 491 U. S., at 535. But fear of "timidity and self-censorship" is a basis for upholding, not striking down, these anti disclosure provisions: They allow private conversations to transpire without inhibition. And unlike the statute at issue in &lt;i&gt;Florida Star,&lt;/i&gt; which had no scienter requirement, see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 539, these statutes only address those who &lt;i&gt;knowingly&lt;/i&gt; disclose an illegally intercepted conversation.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; They do not impose a duty to inquire into the source of the information and one could negligently disclose the contents of an illegally intercepted communication without liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, it is obvious that the &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt; cases upon which the Court relies do not address the question presented here. Our decisions themselves made this clear: "The &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt;  principle does not settle the issue whether, in cases where information has been acquired &lt;i&gt;unlawfully&lt;/i&gt; by a newspaper or by a source, government may ever punish not only the unlawful acquisition, but the ensuing publication as well." &lt;i&gt;Florida Star, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 535, n. 8; see also &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail,&lt;/i&gt; 443 U. S., at 105 ("Our holding in this case is narrow. There is no issue before us of unlawful press [conduct]"); &lt;i&gt;Landmark&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*548&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Communications,&lt;/i&gt; 435 U. S., at 837 ("We are not here concerned with the possible applicability of the statute to one who secures the information by illegal means and thereafter divulges it").&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undaunted, the Court places an inordinate amount of weight upon the fact that the receipt of an illegally intercepted communication has not been criminalized. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt;  at 528-532. But this hardly renders those who knowingly receive and disclose such communications "law-abiding," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 529, and it certainly does not bring them under the &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt; principle. The transmission of the intercepted communication from the eavesdropper to the third party is itself illegal; and where, as here, the third party then knowingly discloses that communication, another illegal act has been committed. The third party in this situation cannot be likened to the reporters in the &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt; cases, who lawfully obtained their information through consensual interviews or public documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These laws are content neutral; they only regulate information that was illegally obtained; they do not restrict republication of what is already in the public domain; they impose no special burdens upon the media; they have a scienter requirement to provide fair warning; and they promote the privacy and free speech of those using cellular telephones. It is hard to imagine a more narrowly tailored prohibition of the disclosure of illegally intercepted communications, and it distorts our precedents to review these statutes under the often fatal standard of strict scrutiny. These laws therefore should be upheld if they further a substantial &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*549&lt;/span&gt; governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free speech, and they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress and the overwhelming majority of States reasonably have concluded that sanctioning the knowing disclosure of illegally intercepted communications will deter the initial interception itself, a crime which is extremely difficult to detect. It is estimated that over 20 million scanners capable of intercepting cellular transmissions currently are in operation, see Thompson, Cell Phone Snooping: Why Electronic Eavesdropping Goes Unpunished, 35 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 137, 149 (1997), notwithstanding the fact that Congress prohibited the marketing of such devices eight years ago, see 47 U. S. C. &#167; 302a(d).&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; As Congress recognized, "[a]ll too often the invasion of privacy itself will go unknown. Only by striking at all aspects of the problem can privacy be adequately protected." S. Rep. No. 1097, at 69. See also Hearings on H. R. 3378 before the Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Justice of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. and 2d Sess., 290 (1986) ("Congress should be under no illusion . . . that the Department [of Justice], because of the difficulty of such investigations, would be able to bring a substantial number of successful prosecutions").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the Court faults Congress for providing "no empirical evidence to support the assumption that the prohibition against disclosures reduces the number of illegal interceptions," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 530-531, and insists that "there is no basis for assuming that imposing sanctions upon respondents will deter the unidentified scanner from continuing &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*550&lt;/span&gt; to engage in surreptitious interceptions," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 531. It is the Court's reasoning, not the judgment of Congress and numerous States regarding the necessity of these laws, which disappoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments will vary up or down with the novelty and plausibility of the justification raised." &lt;i&gt;Nixon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Shrink Missouri Government PAC,&lt;/i&gt; 528 U. S. 377, 391 (2000). "[C]ourts must accord substantial deference to the predictive judgments of Congress." &lt;i&gt;Turner Broadcasting,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S., at 665 (citing &lt;i&gt;Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Democratic National Committee,&lt;/i&gt; 412 U. S. 94, 103 (1973)). This deference recognizes that, as an institution, Congress is far better equipped than the judiciary to evaluate the vast amounts of data bearing upon complex issues and that "[s]ound policy making often requires legislators to forecast future events and to anticipate the likely impact of these events based on deductions and inferences for which complete empirical support may be unavailable." &lt;i&gt;Turner Broadcasting,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S., at 665. Although we must nonetheless independently evaluate such congressional findings in performing our constitutional review, this "is not a license to reweigh the evidence &lt;i&gt;de novo,&lt;/i&gt; or to replace Congress' factual predictions with our own." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 666.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "dry-up-the-market" theory, which posits that it is possible to deter an illegal act that is difficult to police by preventing the wrongdoer from enjoying the fruits of the crime, is neither novel nor implausible. It is a time-tested theory that under girds numerous laws, such as the prohibition of the knowing possession of stolen goods. See 2 W. Lafave &amp;amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law &#167; 8.10(a), p. 422 (1986) ("Without such receivers, theft ceases to be profitable. It is obvious that the receiver must be a principal target of any society anxious to stamp out theft in its various forms"). We ourselves adopted the exclusionary &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*551&lt;/span&gt; rule based upon similar reasoning, believing that it would "deter unreasonable searches," &lt;i&gt;Oregon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Elstad,&lt;/i&gt; 470 U. S. 298, 306 (1985), by removing an officers "incentive to disregard [the Fourth Amendment]," &lt;i&gt;Elkins&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt;  364 U. S. 206, 217 (1960).&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same logic applies here and demonstrates that the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than essential to further the interest of protecting the privacy of individual communications. Were there no prohibition on disclosure, an unlawful eavesdropper who wanted to disclose the conversation could anonymously launder the interception through a third party and thereby avoid detection. Indeed, demand for illegally obtained private information would only increase if it could be disclosed without repercussion. The law against interceptions, which the Court agrees is valid, would be utterly ineffectual without these anti disclosure provisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a similar reason, we upheld against First Amendment challenge a law prohibiting the distribution of child pornography. See &lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ferber,&lt;/i&gt; 458 U. S. 747 (1982). Just as with unlawfully intercepted electronic communications, we there noted the difficulty of policing the "low-profile, clandestine industry" of child pornography production and concurred with 36 legislatures that "[t]he most expeditious if not the only practical method of law enforcement may be to dry up the market for this material by imposing severe criminal penalties on persons selling, advertising, or otherwise promoting the product." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 760. In so doing, we did not demand, nor did Congress provide, any empirical &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*552&lt;/span&gt; evidence to buttress this basic syllogism. Indeed, we reaffirmed the theory's vitality in &lt;i&gt;Osborne&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ohio,&lt;/i&gt; 495 U. S. 103, 109-110 (1990), finding it "surely reasonable for the State to conclude that it will decrease the production of child pornography if it penalizes those who possess and view the product, thereby decreasing demand."&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At base, the Court's decision to hold these statutes unconstitutional rests upon nothing more than the bald substitution of its own prognostications in place of the reasoned judgment of 41 legislative bodies and the United States Congress.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; The Court does not explain how or from where Congress should obtain statistical evidence about the effectiveness of these laws, and "[s]ince as a practical matter it is never easy to prove a negative, it is hardly likely that conclusive factual data could ever be assembled." &lt;i&gt;Elkins, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 218. Reliance upon the "dry-up-the-market" theory &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*553&lt;/span&gt; is both logical and eminently reasonable, and our precedents make plain that it is "far stronger than mere speculation." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Treasury Employees,&lt;/i&gt; 513 U. S. 454, 475 (1995).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These statutes also protect the important interests of deterring clandestine invasions of privacy and preventing the involuntary broadcast of private communications. Over a century ago, Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis recognized that "[t]he intensity and complexity of life, attendant upon advancing civilization, have rendered necessary some retreat from the world, and man, under the refining influence of culture, has become more sensitive to publicity, so that solitude and privacy have become more essential to the individual." The Right to Privacy, 4 Harv. L. Rev. 193, 196 (1890). "There is necessarily, and within suitably defined areas, a . . . freedom &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to speak publicly, one which serves the same ultimate end as freedom of speech in its affirmative aspect." &lt;i&gt;Harper &amp;amp; Row, Publishers, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Nation Enterprises,&lt;/i&gt; 471 U. S. 539, 559 (1985) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). One who speaks into a phone "is surely entitled to assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world." &lt;i&gt;Katz&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 389 U. S. 347, 352 (1967); cf. &lt;i&gt;Gelbard&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 408 U. S. 41, 52 (1972) (compelling testimony about matters obtained from an illegal interception at a grand jury proceeding "compounds the statutorily proscribed invasion of . . . privacy by adding to the injury of the interception the insult of . . . disclosure").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These statutes undeniably protect this venerable right of privacy. Concomitantly, they further the First Amendment rights of the parties to the conversation. "At the heart of the First Amendment lies the principle that each person should decide for himself or herself the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration, and adherence." &lt;i&gt;Turner Broadcasting,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S., at 641. By "protecting the privacy of individual thought and expression," &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*554&lt;/span&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States Dist. Court for Eastern Dist. of Mich.,&lt;/i&gt; 407 U. S. 297, 302 (1972), these statutes further the "uninhibited, robust, and wide-open" speech of the private parties, &lt;i&gt;New York Times Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sullivan,&lt;/i&gt; 376 U. S. 254, 270 (1964). Unlike the laws at issue in the &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt; cases, which served only to protect the identities and actions of a select group of individuals, these laws protect millions of people who communicate electronically on a daily basis. The chilling effect of the Court's decision upon these private conversations will surely be great: An estimated 49.1 million analog cellular telephones are currently in operation. See Hao, Nokia Profits from Surge in Cell Phones, Fla. Today, July 18, 1999, p. E1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Court recognizes and even extols the virtues of this right to privacy, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 532-533, these are "mere words," W. Shakespeare, Troilus and Cressida, act v, sc. 3, overridden by the Court's newfound right to publish unlawfully acquired information of "public concern," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt;  at 525. The Court concludes that the private conversation between Gloria Bartnicki and Anthony Kane is somehow a "debate . . . . worthy of constitutional protection." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt;  at 535. Perhaps the Court is correct that "[i]f the statements about the labor negotiations had been made in a public arena&#151;during a bargaining session, for example&#151; they would have been newsworthy." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 525. The point, however, is that Bartnicki and Kane had no intention of contributing to a public "debate" at all, and it is perverse to hold that another's unlawful interception and knowing disclosure of their conversation is speech "worthy of constitutional protection." Cf. &lt;i&gt;Hurley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 515 U. S. 557, 573 (1995) ("[O]ne important manifestation of the principle of free speech is that one who chooses to speak may also decide `what not to say' "). The Constitution should not protect the involuntary broadcast of personal conversations. Even where the communications involve public figures or &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*555&lt;/span&gt; concern public matters, the conversations are nonetheless private and worthy of protection. Although public persons may have forgone the right to live their lives screened from public scrutiny in some areas, it does not and should not follow that they also have abandoned their right to have a private conversation without fear of it being intentionally intercepted and knowingly disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court's decision to hold inviolable our right to broadcast conversations of "public importance" enjoys little support in our precedents. As discussed above, given the qualified nature of their holdings, the &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt; cases cannot bear the weight the Court places upon them. More mystifying still is the Court's reliance upon the "Pentagon Papers" case, &lt;i&gt;New York Times Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 403 U. S. 713 (1971) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; which involved the United States' attempt to prevent the publication of Defense Department documents relating to the Vietnam War. In addition to involving Government controlled information, that case fell squarely under our precedents holding that prior restraints on speech bear "`a heavy presumption against . . . constitutionality.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 714. Indeed, it was this presumption that caused Justices Stewart and White to join the 6-to-3 &lt;i&gt;per curiam&lt;/i&gt; decision. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 730-731 (White, J., joined by Stewart, J., concurring) ("I concur in today's judgments, but only because of the concededly extraordinary protection against prior restraints enjoyed by the press under our constitutional system"). By no stretch of the imagination can the statutes at issue here be dubbed "prior restraints." And the Court's "parallel reasoning" from other in apposite cases fails to persuade. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 535.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely "the interest in individual privacy," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 518, at its narrowest, must embrace the right to be free from surreptitious eavesdropping on, and involuntary broadcast of, our cellular telephone conversations. The Court subordinates that right, not to the claims of those who themselves wish to speak, but to the claims of those who wish to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*556&lt;/span&gt; publish the intercepted conversations of others. Congress' effort to balance the above claim to privacy against a marginal claim to speak freely is thereby set at naught.&lt;/p&gt;

McDermott by &lt;i&gt;Frank Cicero, Jr., Christopher Landau,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Daryl Joseffer.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  See 48 Stat. 1069, 1103.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Either actual damages or "statutory damages of whichever is the greater of $100 a day for each day of violation or $10,000" may be recovered under 18 U. S. C. &#167; 2520(c)(2);under the Pennsylvania Act, the amount is the greater of$100 a day or $1,000, but the plaintiff may also recover punitive damages and reasonable attorney's fees. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &#167; 5725(a) (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Title 18U. S. C. &#167; 2511(1)(c) provides that any person who "intentionally discloses, or endeavors to disclose, to any other person the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication, knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication in violation of this subsection;. . . shall be punished . . . ." The Pennsylvania Act contains a similar provision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Title 18 U. S. C. &#167; 2511(1)(a) provides: "(1) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter [&#167;&#167; 2510-2520 (1994 ed. and Supp. V)] any person who&#151;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(a) intentionally intercepts, endeavors to intercept, or procures any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, oral, or electronic communication; . . . shall be punished . . . ."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  In the &lt;i&gt;Boehner&lt;/i&gt; case,as in this suit, a conversation over a car cell phone was intercepted, but in that case the defendant knew both who was responsible for intercepting the conversation and how they had done it. 191 F. 3d, at 465. In the opinion of the majority, the defendant acted unlawfully in accepting the tape in order to provide it to the media. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 476. Apparently because the couple responsible for the interception did not eavesdrop "for purposes of direct or indirect commercial advantage or private financial gain," they were fined only $500. See Department of Justice Press Release, Apr. 23, 1997. In another similar case involving a claim for damages under &#167; 2511(1)(c), &lt;i&gt;Peavy&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;WFAA&#151;TV, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt;  221 F. 3d 158 (CA5 2000), the media defendant in fact participated in the interceptions at issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  In particular,calls placed on cellularand cordless telephones can be intercepted more easily than those placed on traditional phones. See &lt;i&gt;Shubert&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Metrophone, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 898 F. 2d 401, 404-405 (CA3 1990). Although calls placed on cell and cordless phones can be easily intercepted, it is not clear how often intentional interceptions take place. From 1992 through 1997, less than 100 cases were prosecuted charging violations of 18 U. S. C. &#167; 2511. See Statement of James K. Kallstrom, Assistant Director in Charge of the New York Division of the FBI on February 5, 1997 before the Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade, and Consumer Protection, Committee on Commerce, U. S. House of Representatives Regarding Cellular Privacy. However, information concerning techniques and devices for intercepting cell and cordless phone calls can be found in a number of publications, trade magazines, and sites on the Internet, see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 6, and at one set of congressional hearings in 1997, a scanner, purchased off the shelf and minimally modified, was used to intercept phone calls of Members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nix&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;O'Malley,&lt;/i&gt; 160 F. 3d 343, 346 (CA6 1998); &lt;i&gt;McKamey&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Roach,&lt;/i&gt; 55 F. 3d 1236, 1240 (CA6 1995).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  In answering this question, we draw no distinction between the media respondents and Yocum. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sullivan,&lt;/i&gt; 376 U. S. 254, 265-266 (1964); &lt;i&gt;First Nat. Bank of Boston&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bellotti,&lt;/i&gt; 435 U. S. 765, 777 (1978).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9]  "But while a content-based purpose may be sufficient in certain circumstances to show that a regulation is content based, it is not necessary to such a showing in all cases. . . . Nor will the mere assertion of a contentneutral purpose be enough to save a law which, on its face, discriminates based on content." &lt;i&gt;Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;FCC,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S. 622, 642-643 (1994).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[10]  The Solicitor General has cataloged some of the cases that fall under subsection (d): "[I]t is unlawful for a company to use an illegally intercepted communication about a business rival in order to create a competing product; it is unlawful for an investor to use illegally intercepted communications in trading in securities; it is unlawful for a union to use an illegally intercepted communication about management (or vice versa) to prepare strategy for contract negotiations; it is unlawful for a supervisor to use information in an illegally recorded conversation to discipline a subordinate; and it is unlawful for a blackmailer to use an illegally intercepted communication for purposes of extortion. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 1968 Senate Report 67 (corporate and labor-management uses); &lt;i&gt;Fultz&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gilliam,&lt;/i&gt; 942 F. 2d 396, 400 n. 4 (6th Cir. 1991) (extortion); &lt;i&gt;Dorris&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Absher,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/tnmd/d8Bz/dorris-v-absher/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;959&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;813&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 815-817 (M. D. Tenn. 1997) (workplace discipline), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 179 F. 3d 420 (6th Cir. 1999). The statute has also been held to bar the use of illegally intercepted communications for important and socially valuable purposes. See &lt;i&gt;In re Grand Jury,&lt;/i&gt; 111 F. 3d 1066, 1077-1079 (3d Cir. 1997)." Brief for United States 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[11]  Put another way, what gave rise to statutory liability in this suit was the information communicated on the tapes. See &lt;i&gt;Boehner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McDermott,&lt;/i&gt;  191 F. 3d 463, 484 (CADC 1999) (Sentelle, J., dissenting) ("What . . . is being punished . . . here is not conduct dependent upon the nature or origin of the tapes; it is speech dependent upon the nature of the contents").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[12]  That question was subsequently reserved in &lt;i&gt;Landmark Communications, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Virginia,&lt;/i&gt; 435 U. S. 829, 837 (1978).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[13]  In cases relying on such a rationale, moreover, the speech at issue is considered of minimal value. &lt;i&gt;Osborne&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ohio,&lt;/i&gt; 495 U. S. 103 (1990); &lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt; v.&lt;i&gt;Ferber,&lt;/i&gt; 458 U. S., at 762 ("The value of permitting live performances and photographic reproductions of children engaged in lewd sexual conduct is exceedingly modest, if not &lt;i&gt;de minimis&lt;/i&gt; ").
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government also points to two other areas of the law&#151;namely, mail theft and stolen property&#151;in which a ban on the receipt or possession of an item is used to deter some primary illegality. Brief for United States 14; see also &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 550-551 (Rehnquist, C. J.,dissenting). Neither of those examples, though, involve prohibitions on speech. As such, they are not relevant to a First Amendment analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[14]  The media respondents have included a list of 143 cases under &#167; 2511(1)(a) and 63 cases under &#167;&#167; 2511(1)(c) and (d)&#151;which must also involve violations of subsection (a)&#151;in an appendix to their brief. The Reply Brief filed by the United States contains an appendix describing each of the cases in the latter group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[15]  Inonly 5 of the 206 cases listed in the appendixes, see n. 14, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt;  n. 17, &lt;i&gt;infra,&lt;/i&gt; was the identity of the interceptor wholly unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[16]  The legislative history of the 1968 Act indicates that Congress' concern focused on private surveillance "in domestic relations and industrial espionage situations." S. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 225 (1968). Similarly, in connection with the enactment of the 1986 amendment, one Senator referred to the interest in protecting private communications from "a corporate spy, a police officer without probable cause, or just a plain snoop." 131 Cong. Rec. 24366 (1985) (statement of Sen. Leahy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[17]  The dissent argues that we have not given proper respect to "congressional findings" or to "`Congress' factual predictions.' " &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 550. But the relevant factual foundation is not to be found in the legislative record. Moreover, the dissent does not argue that Congress did provide empirical evidence in support of its assumptions, nor, for that matter, does it take real issue with the fact that in the vast majority of cases involving illegal interceptions, the identity of the person or persons responsible for the interceptions is known. Instead, the dissent advances a minor disagreement with our numbers, stating that nine cases "involved an unknown &lt;i&gt;or unproved&lt;/i&gt; eavesdropper." &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 552, n. 9 (emphasis added). The dissent includes in that number cases in which the identity of the interceptor, though suspected, was not "proved" because the identity of the interceptor was not at issue or the evidence was insufficient. In any event, whether there are 5 cases or 9 involving anonymous interceptors out of the 206 cases under &#167; 2511, in most of the cases involving illegal interceptions, the identity of the interceptor is no mystery. If, as the proponents of the dry-up-the-market theory would have it, it is difficult to identify the persons responsible for illegal interceptions (and thus necessary to prohibit disclosure by third parties with no connection to, or responsibility for, the initial illegality), one would expect to see far more cases in which the identity of the interceptor was unknown (and, concomitantly, far fewer in which the interceptor remained anonymous). Thus, not only is there a dearth of evidence in the legislative record to support the dry-up-the-market theory, but what post enactment evidence is available cuts against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[18]  Indeed, even the burden of justifying restrictions on commercial speech requires more than "`mere speculation or conjecture.' " &lt;i&gt;Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Assn., Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 527 U. S. 173, 188 (1999).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[19]  Our holding, of course, does not apply to punishing parties for obtaining the relevant information unlawfully. "It would be frivolous to assert&#151;and no one does in these cases&#151;that the First Amendment, in the interest of securing news or otherwise, confers a license on either the reporter or his news sources to violate valid criminal laws. Although stealing documents or private wiretapping could provide newsworthy information, neither reporter nor source is immune from conviction for such conduct, whatever the impact on the flow of news." &lt;i&gt;Branzburg&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hayes,&lt;/i&gt; 408 U. S. 665, 691 (1972).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[20]  "`The essential thrust of the First Amendment is to prohibit improper restraints on the &lt;i&gt;voluntary&lt;/i&gt; public expression of ideas; it shields the man who wants to speak or publish when others wish him to be quiet. There is necessarily, and within suitably defined areas, a concomitant freedom &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to speak publicly, one which serves the same ultimate end as freedom of speech in its affirmative aspect.' " &lt;i&gt;Harper &amp;amp; Row, Publishers, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Nation Enterprises,&lt;/i&gt; 471 U. S., at 559 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Estate of Hemingway&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Random House, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 23 N. Y. 2d 341, 348, 244 N. E. 2d 250, 255 (1968)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[21]  Moreover, "our decisions establish that absent exceptional circumstances, reputational interests alone cannot justify the proscription of truthful speech." &lt;i&gt;Butterworth&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Smith,&lt;/i&gt; 494 U. S. 624, 634 (1990).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[22]  See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Florida Star&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;B. J. F.,&lt;/i&gt; 491 U. S. 524, 535 (1989) (acknowledging "the `timidity and self-censorship' which may result from allowing the media to be punished for publishing truthful information").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2]  "Electronic communication" is defined as "any transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photo electronic or photo optical system." 18 U. S. C. &#167; 2510(12) (1994 ed., Supp. V).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  The one exception was &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail,&lt;/i&gt; where reporters obtained the juvenile defendant's name from witnesses to the crime. See 443 U. S., at 99. However, the statute at issue there imposed a blanket prohibition on the publication of the information. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 98-99. In contrast, these antidisclosure provisions do not prohibit publication so long as the information comes from a legal source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  In 1986, to ensure that only the most culpable could face liability for disclosure, Congress increased the scienter requirement from "willful" to "intentional." 18 U. S. C. &#167; 2511(1)(c); see also S. Rep. No. 99-541, p. 6 (1986) ("In order to underscore that the inadvertent reception of a protected communication is not a crime, the subcommittee changed the state of mind requirement under [Title III] from `willful' to `intentional' ").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  Tellingly,we noted in &lt;i&gt;Florida Star&lt;/i&gt; that "[t]o the extent sensitive information rests in private hands, the government may under some circumstances forbid its nonconsensual acquisition, thereby bringing outside of the &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt; principle the publication of any information so acquired." 491 U. S., at 534; see also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 535 ("[I]t is highly anomalous to sanction persons other than the source of [the] release").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  The problem is pervasive because legal "radio scanners [may be] modified to intercept cellular calls." S. Rep. No. 99-541, at 9. For example, the scanner at issue in &lt;i&gt;Boehner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McDermott,&lt;/i&gt; 191 F. 3d 463 (CADC 1999), had been recently purchased at Radio Shack. See Thompson, 35 Am. Crim. L. Rev., at 152, and n. 138 (citing Stratton, Scanner Wasn't Supposed to Pick up Call, But it Did, Orlando Sentinel, Jan. 18, 1997, p. A15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  In crafting the exclusionary rule, we did not first require empirical evidence. See &lt;i&gt;Elkins,&lt;/i&gt; 364 U. S., at 218 ("Empirical statistics are not available to show that the inhabitants of states which follow the exclusionary rule suffer less from lawless searches and seizures than do those of states which admit evidence unlawfully obtained"). When it comes to this Court's awesome power to strike down an Act of Congress as unconstitutional, it should not be "do as we say, not as we do."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  The Court attempts to distinguish &lt;i&gt;Ferber&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Osborne&lt;/i&gt; on the ground that they involved low-value speech, but this has nothing to do with the reasonableness of the "dry-up-the-market" theory. The Court also posits that Congress here could simply have increased the penalty for intercepting cellular communications. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 529. But the Court's back-seat legislative advice does nothing to undermine the reasonableness of Congress' belief that prohibiting only the initial interception would not effectively protect the privacy interests of cellular telephone users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9]  The Court observes that in many of the cases litigated under &#167; 2511(1), "the person or persons intercepting the communication ha[ve] been known." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 530. Of the 206 cases cited in the appendices, 143 solely involved &#167; 2511(1)(a) claims of wrongful interception&#151;&lt;i&gt;disclosure&lt;/i&gt;  was not at issue. It is of course unremarkable that intentional &lt;i&gt;interception&lt;/i&gt; cases have not been pursued where the identity of the eavesdropper was unknown. Of the 61 disclosure and use cases with published facts brought under &#167;&#167; 2511(1)(c) and (d), 9 involved an unknown or unproved eavesdropper, 1 involved a lawful pen register, and 5 involved recordings that were not surreptitious. Thus, as relevant, 46 disclosure cases involved known eavesdroppers. Whatever might be gleaned from this figure, the Court is practicing voodoo statistics when it states that it undermines the "dry-up-the-market" theory. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 531, n. 17. These cases say absolutely nothing about the interceptions and disclosures that have been &lt;i&gt;deterred.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Argued March 28, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided May 14, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*485&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*485&lt;/span&gt; Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Scalia, and Kennedy, JJ., joined. Stevens, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Souter and Ginsburg, JJ., joined, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 499. Breyer, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acting Solicitor General Underwood&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With her on the briefs were former &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Ogden, Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lisa Schiavo Blatt.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gerald F. Uelmen&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;James J. Brosnahan, Annette P. Carnegie, Christina Kirk-Kazhe, Robert A. Raich,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Randy E. Barnett.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*486&lt;/span&gt; Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Controlled Substances Act, 84 Stat. 1242, 21 U. S. C. &#167; 801 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; prohibits the manufacture and distribution of various drugs, including marijuana. In this case, we must decide whether there is a medical necessity exception to these prohibitions. We hold that there is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 1996, California voters enacted an initiative measure entitled the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. Attempting "[t]o ensure that seriously ill Californians have the right to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes," Cal. Health &amp;amp; Safety Code Ann. &#167; 11362.5 (West Supp. 2001), the statute creates an exception to California laws prohibiting the possession and cultivation of marijuana. These prohibitions no longer apply to a patient or his primary caregiver who possesses or cultivates marijuana for the patient's medical purposes upon the recommendation or approval of a physician. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; In the wake of this voter initiative, several groups organized "medical cannabis dispensaries" to meet the needs of qualified patients. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cannabis Cultivators Club,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1086&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 1092 (ND Cal. 1998). Respondent Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative is one of these groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cooperative is a not-for-profit organization that operates in downtown Oakland. A physician serves as medical director, and registered nurses staff the Cooperative during business hours. To become a member, a patient must provide a written statement from a treating physician assenting to marijuana therapy and must submit to a screening interview. If accepted as a member, the patient receives an identification card entitling him to obtain marijuana from the Cooperative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 1998, the United States sued the Cooperative and its executive director, respondent Jeffrey Jones (together, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*487&lt;/span&gt; the Cooperative), in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Seeking to enjoin the Cooperative from distributing and manufacturing marijuana,&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; the United States argued that, whether or not the Cooperative's activities are legal under California law, they violate federal law. Specifically, the Government argued that the Cooperative violated the Controlled Substances Act's prohibitions on distributing, manufacturing, and possessing with the intent to distribute or manufacture a controlled substance. 21 U. S. C. &#167; 841(a). Concluding that the Government had established a probability of success on the merits, the District Court granted a preliminary injunction. App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a&#151;40a; 5 F. Supp. 2d, at 1105.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cooperative did not appeal the injunction but instead openly violated it by distributing marijuana to numerous persons, App. to Pet. for Cert. 21a&#151;23a. To terminate these violations, the Government initiated contempt proceedings. In defense, the Cooperative contended that any distributions were medically necessary. Marijuana is the only drug, according to the Cooperative, that can alleviate the severe pain and other debilitating symptoms of the Cooperative's patients. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 29a. The District Court rejected this defense, however, after determining there was insufficient evidence that each recipient of marijuana was in actual danger of imminent harm without the drug. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 29a&#151;32a. The District Court found the Cooperative in contempt and, at the Government's request, modified the preliminary injunction to empower the United States Marshal to seize the Cooperative's premises. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 37a. Although recognizing that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*488&lt;/span&gt; "human suffering" could result, the District Court reasoned that a court's "equitable powers [do] not permit it to ignore federal law." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Three days later, the District Court summarily rejected a motion by the Cooperative to modify the injunction to permit distributions that are medically necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cooperative appealed both the contempt order and the denial of the Cooperative's motion to modify. Before the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decided the case, however, the Cooperative voluntarily purged its contempt by promising the District Court that it would comply with the initial preliminary injunction. Consequently, the Court of Appeals determined that the appeal of the contempt order was moot. 190 F. 3d 1109, 1112-1113 (1999).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The denial of the Cooperative's motion to modify the injunction, however, presented a live controversy that was appealable under 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1292(a)(1). Reaching the merits of this issue, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded. According to the Court of Appeals, the medical necessity defense was a "legally cognizable defense" that likely would apply in the circumstances. 190 F. 3d, at 1114. Moreover, the Court of Appeals reasoned, the District Court erroneously "believed that it had no discretion to issue an injunction that was more limited in scope than the Controlled Substances Act itself." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1114-1115. Because, according to the Court of Appeals, district courts retain "broad equitable discretion" to fashion injunctive relief, the District Court could have, and should have, weighed the "public interest" and considered factors such as the serious harm in depriving patients of marijuana. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Remanding the case, the Court of Appeals instructed the District Court to consider "the criteria for a medical necessity exemption, and, should it modify the injunction, to set forth those criteria in the modification order." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1115. Following these instructions, the District Court granted the Cooperative's &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*489&lt;/span&gt; motion to modify the injunction to incorporate a medical necessity defense.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States petitioned for certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' decision that medical necessity is a legally cognizable defense to violations of the Controlled Substances Act. Because the decision raises significant questions as to the ability of the United States to enforce the Nation's drug laws, we granted certiorari. 531 U. S. 1010 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Controlled Substances Act provides that, "[e]xcept as authorized by this subchapter, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally . . . to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance." 21 U. S. C. &#167; 841(a)(1). The subchapter, in turn, establishes exceptions. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*490&lt;/span&gt; For marijuana (and other drugs that have been classified as "schedule I" controlled substances), there is but one express exception, and it is available only for Government-approved research projects, &#167; 823(f). Not conducting such a project, the Cooperative cannot, and indeed does not, claim this statutory exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cooperative contends, however, that notwithstanding the apparently absolute language of &#167; 841(a), the statute is subject to additional, implied exceptions, one of which is medical necessity. According to the Cooperative, because necessity was a defense at common law, medical necessity should be read into the Controlled Substances Act. We disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an initial matter, we note that it is an open question whether federal courts ever have authority to recognize a necessity defense not provided by statute. A necessity defense "traditionally covered the situation where physical forces beyond the actor's control rendered illegal conduct the lesser of two evils." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bailey,&lt;/i&gt; 444 U. S. 394, 410 (1980). Even at common law, the defense of necessity was somewhat controversial. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Queen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dudley &amp;amp; Stephens,&lt;/i&gt; 14 Q. B. 273 (1884). And under our constitutional system, in which federal crimes are defined by statute rather than by common law, see &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hudson,&lt;/i&gt; 7 Cranch 32, 34 (1812), it is especially so. As we have stated: "Whether, as a policy matter, an exemption should be created is a question for legislative judgment, not judicial inference." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rutherford,&lt;/i&gt; 442 U. S. 544, 559 (1979). Nonetheless, we recognize that this Court has discussed the possibility of a necessity defense without altogether rejecting it. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bailey, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 415.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*491&lt;/span&gt; We need not decide, however, whether necessity can ever be a defense when the federal statute does not expressly provide for it. In this case, to resolve the question presented, we need only recognize that a medical necessity exception for marijuana is at odds with the terms of the Controlled Substances Act. The statute, to be sure, does not explicitly abrogate the defense.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; But its provisions leave no doubt that the defense is unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under any conception of legal necessity, one principle is clear: The defense cannot succeed when the legislature itself has made a "determination of values." 1 W. LaFave &amp;amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law &#167; 5.4, p. 629 (1986). In the case of the Controlled Substances Act, the statute reflects a determination that marijuana has no medical benefits worthy of an exception (outside the confines of a Governmentapproved research project). Whereas some other drugs can be dispensed and prescribed for medical use, see 21 U. S. C. &#167; 829, the same is not true for marijuana. Indeed, for purposes of the Controlled Substances Act, marijuana has "no currently accepted medical use" at all. &#167; 812.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of the Act supports this conclusion. The statute divides drugs into five schedules, depending in part on whether the particular drug has a currently accepted &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*492&lt;/span&gt; medical use. The Act then imposes restrictions on the manufacture and distribution of the substance according to the schedule in which it has been placed. Schedule I is the most restrictive schedule.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; The Attorney General can include a drug in schedule I only if the drug "has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States," "has a high potential for abuse," and has "a lack of accepted safety for use . . . under medical supervision." &#167;&#167; 812(b)(1)(A)&#151;(C). Under the statute, the Attorney General could not put marijuana into schedule I if marijuana had any accepted medical use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cooperative points out, however, that the Attorney General did not place marijuana into schedule I. Congress put it there, and Congress was not required to find that a drug lacks an accepted medical use before including the drug in schedule I. We are not persuaded that this distinction has any significance to our inquiry. Under the Cooperative's logic, drugs that Congress places in schedule I could be distributed when medically necessary whereas drugs that the Attorney General places in schedule I could not. Nothing in the statute, however, suggests that there are two tiers of schedule I narcotics, with drugs in one tier more readily available than drugs in the other. On the contrary, the statute consistently treats all schedule I drugs alike. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt;  &#167; 823(a) (providing criteria for Attorney General to consider when determining whether to register an applicant to manufacture schedule I controlled substances), &#167; 823(b) (providing criteria for Attorney General to consider when determining whether to register an applicant to distribute schedule I controlled substances), &#167; 823(f) (providing procedures for becoming a government-approved research project), &#167; 826 (establishing production quotas for schedule I drugs). Moreover, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*493&lt;/span&gt; the Cooperative offers no convincing explanation for why drugs that Congress placed on schedule I should be subject to fewer controls than the drugs that the Attorney General placed on the schedule. Indeed, the Cooperative argues that, in placing marijuana and other drugs on schedule I, Congress "wishe[d] to assert the most restrictive level of controls created by the [Controlled Substances Act]." Brief for Respondents 24. If marijuana should be subject to the most restrictive level of controls, it should not be treated any less restrictively than other schedule I drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cooperative further argues that use of schedule I drugs generally&#151;whether placed in schedule I by Congress or the Attorney General&#151;can be medically necessary, notwithstanding that they have "no currently accepted medical use." According to the Cooperative, a drug may not yet have achieved general acceptance as a medical treatment but may nonetheless have medical benefits to a particular patient or class of patients. We decline to parse the statute in this manner. It is clear from the text of the Act that Congress has made a determination that marijuana has no medical benefits worthy of an exception. The statute expressly contemplates that many drugs "have a useful and legitimate medical purpose and are necessary to maintain the health and general welfare of the American people," &#167; 801(1), but it includes no exception at all for any medical use of marijuana. Unwilling to view this omission as an accident, and unable in any event to override a legislative determination manifest in a statute, we reject the Cooperative's argument.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*494&lt;/span&gt; Finally, the Cooperative contends that we should construe the Controlled Substances Act to include a medical necessity defense in order to avoid what it considers to be difficult constitutional questions. In particular, the Cooperative asserts that, shorn of a medical necessity defense, the statute exceeds Congress' Commerce Clause powers, violates the substantive due process rights of patients, and offends the fundamental liberties of the people under the Fifth, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments. As the Cooperative acknowledges, however, the canon of constitutional avoidance has no application in the absence of statutory ambiguity. Because we have no doubt that the Controlled Substances Act cannot bear a medical necessity defense to distributions of marijuana, we do not find guidance in this avoidance principle. Nor do we consider the underlying constitutional issues today. Because the Court of Appeals did not address these claims, we decline to do so in the first instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, we hold that medical necessity is not a defense to manufacturing and distributing marijuana.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; The &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*495&lt;/span&gt; Court of Appeals erred when it held that medical necessity is a "legally cognizable defense." 190 F. 3d, at 1114. It further erred when it instructed the District Court on remand to consider "the criteria for a medical necessity exemption, and, should it modify the injunction, to set forth those criteria in the modification order." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1115.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cooperative contends that, even if the Controlled Substances Act forecloses the medical necessity defense, there is an alternative ground for affirming the Court of Appeals. This case, the Cooperative reminds us, arises from a motion to modify an injunction to permit distributions that are medically necessary. According to the Cooperative, the Court of Appeals was correct that the District Court had "broad equitable discretion" to tailor the injunctive relief to account for medical necessity, irrespective of whether there is a legal defense of necessity in the statute. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1114. To sustain the judgment below, the argument goes, we need only reaffirm that federal courts, in the exercise of their equity jurisdiction, have discretion to modify an injunction based upon a weighing of the public interest.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We disagree. Although district courts whose equity powers have been properly invoked indeed have discretion in fashioning injunctive relief (in the absence of a statutory restriction), the Court of Appeals erred concerning the factors that the district courts may consider in exercising such discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*496&lt;/span&gt; A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an initial matter, the Cooperative is correct that, when district courts are properly acting as courts of equity, they have discretion unless a statute clearly provides otherwise. For "several hundred years," courts of equity have enjoyed "sound discretion" to consider the "necessities of the public interest" when fashioning injunctive relief. &lt;i&gt;Hecht Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bowles,&lt;/i&gt; 321 U. S. 321, 329-330 (1944). See also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 329 ("The essence of equity jurisdiction has been the power of the Chancellor to do equity and to mould each decree to the necessities of the particular case. Flexibility rather than rigidity has distinguished it"); &lt;i&gt;Weinberger&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Romero-Barcelo,&lt;/i&gt;  456 U. S. 305, 312 (1982) ("In exercising their sound discretion, courts of equity should pay particular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction"). Such discretion is displaced only by a "clear and valid legislative command." &lt;i&gt;Porter&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Warner Holding Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 328 U. S. 395, 398 (1946). See also &lt;i&gt;Romero-Barcelo, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 313 ("Of course, Congress may intervene and guide or control the exercise of the courts' discretion, but we do not lightly assume that Congress has intended to depart from established principles").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cooperative is also correct that the District Court in this case had discretion. The Controlled Substances Act vests district courts with jurisdiction to enjoin violations of the Act, 21 U. S. C. &#167; 882(a). But a "grant of jurisdiction to issue [equitable relief] hardly suggests an absolute duty to do so under any and all circumstances," &lt;i&gt;Hecht, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 329 (emphasis deleted). Because the District Court's use of equitable power is not textually required by any "clear and valid legislative command," the court did not have to issue an injunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;TVA&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hill,&lt;/i&gt; 437 U. S. 153 (1978), does not support the Government's contention that the District Court lacked discretion in fashioning injunctive relief. In &lt;i&gt;Hill,&lt;/i&gt; the Court held that the Endangered Species Act of 1973 required the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*497&lt;/span&gt; District Court to enjoin completion of a dam, whose operation would either eradicate the known population of the snail darter or destroy its critical habitat. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 193-195. The District Court lacked discretion because an injunction was the "only means of ensuring compliance." &lt;i&gt;Romero-Barcelo, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 314 (explaining why the District Court in &lt;i&gt;Hill&lt;/i&gt;  lacked discretion). Congress' "order of priorities," as expressed in the statute, would be deprived of effect if the District Court could choose to deny injunctive relief. &lt;i&gt;Hill, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 194. In effect, the District Court had only a Hobson's choice. By contrast, with respect to the Controlled Substances Act, criminal enforcement is an alternative, and indeed the customary, means of ensuring compliance with the statute. Congress' resolution of the policy issues can be (and usually is) upheld without an injunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the mere fact that the District Court had discretion does not suggest that the District Court, when evaluating the motion to modify the injunction, could consider any and all factors that might relate to the public interest or the conveniences of the parties, including the medical needs of the Cooperative's patients. On the contrary, a court sitting in equity cannot "ignore the judgment of Congress, deliberately expressed in legislation." &lt;i&gt;Virginian R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Railway Employees,&lt;/i&gt; 300 U. S. 515, 551 (1937). A district court cannot, for example, override Congress' policy choice, articulated in a statute, as to what behavior should be prohibited. "Once Congress, exercising its delegated powers, has decided the order of priorities in a given area, it is . . . for the courts to enforce them when enforcement is sought." &lt;i&gt;Hill,&lt;/i&gt; 437 U. S., at 194. Courts of equity cannot, in their discretion, reject the balance that Congress has struck in a statute. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 194-195. Their choice (unless there is statutory language to the contrary) is simply whether a particular means of enforcing the statute should be chosen over another permissible &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*498&lt;/span&gt; means; their choice is not whether enforcement is preferable to no enforcement at all.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; Consequently, when a court of equity exercises its discretion, it may not consider the advantages and disadvantages of nonenforcement of the statute, but only the advantages and disadvantages of "employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction," &lt;i&gt;RomeroBarcelo,&lt;/i&gt; 456 U. S., at 312, over the other available methods of enforcement. Cf. &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 316 (referring to "discretion to rely on remedies other than an immediate prohibitory injunction"). To the extent the district court considers the public interest and the conveniences of the parties, the court is limited to evaluating how such interest and conveniences are affected by the selection of an injunction over other enforcement mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;C&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the Court of Appeals erred by considering relevant the evidence that some people have "serious medical conditions for whom the use of cannabis is necessary in order to treat or alleviate those conditions or their symptoms," that these people "will suffer serious harm if they are denied cannabis," and that "there is no legal alternative to cannabis &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*499&lt;/span&gt; for the effective treatment of their medical conditions." 190 F. 3d, at 1115. As explained above, in the Controlled Substances Act, the balance already has been struck against a medical necessity exception. Because the statutory prohibitions cover even those who have what could be termed a medical necessity, the Act precludes consideration of this evidence. It was thus error for the Court of Appeals to instruct the District Court on remand to consider "the criteria for a medical necessity exemption, and, should it modify the injunction, to set forth those criteria in the modification order." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;* * *&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg join, concurring in the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lest the Court's narrow holding be lost in its broad dicta, let me restate it here: "[W]e hold that medical necessity is not a defense to &lt;i&gt;manufacturing&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;distributing&lt;/i&gt; marijuana." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 494 (emphasis added). This confined holding is consistent with our grant of certiorari, which was limited to the question "[w]hether the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U. S. C. 801 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; forecloses a medical necessity defense to the Act's prohibition against &lt;i&gt;manufacturing&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;distributing&lt;/i&gt; marijuana, a Schedule I controlled substance." Pet. for Cert. (I) (emphasis added). And, at least with respect to distribution, this holding is consistent with how the issue was raised and litigated below. As stated by the District Court, the question before it was "whether [respondents'] admitted &lt;i&gt;distribution&lt;/i&gt; of marijuana for use by seriously &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*500&lt;/span&gt; ill persons upon a physician's recommendation violates federal law," and if so, whether such distribution "should be enjoined pursuant to the injunctive relief provisions of the federal Controlled Substances Act." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cannabis Cultivators Club,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1086&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 1091 (ND Cal. 1998) (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, in the lower courts as well as here, respondents have raised the medical necessity defense as a justification for distributing marijuana to cooperative members, and it was in that context that the Ninth Circuit determined that respondents had "a legally cognizable defense." 190 F. 3d 1109, 1114 (1999). The Court is surely correct to reverse that determination. Congress' classification of marijuana as a schedule I controlled substance&#151;that is, one that cannot be distributed outside of approved research projects, see 21 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 812, 823(f), 829&#151;makes it clear that "the Controlled Substances Act cannot bear a medical necessity defense to &lt;i&gt;distributions&lt;/i&gt; of marijuana," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 494 (emphasis added).&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from its limited holding, the Court takes two unwarranted and unfortunate excursions that prevent me from joining its opinion. First, the Court reaches beyond its holding, and beyond the facts of the case, by suggesting that the defense of necessity is unavailable for anyone under the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*501&lt;/span&gt; Controlled Substances Act. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 491-493, 494-495, n. 7, 499. Because necessity was raised in this case as a defense to distribution, the Court need not venture an opinion on whether the defense is available to anyone other than distributors. Most notably, whether the defense might be available to a seriously ill patient for whom there is no alternative means of avoiding starvation or extraordinary suffering is a difficult issue that is not presented here.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the Court gratuitously casts doubt on "whether necessity can ever be a defense" to &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; federal statute that does not explicitly provide for it, calling such a defense into question by a misleading reference to its existence as an "open question." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 490, 491. By contrast, our precedent has expressed no doubt about the viability of the common-law defense, even in the context of federal criminal statutes that do not provide for it in so many words. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bailey,&lt;/i&gt; 444 U. S. 394, 415 (1980) ("We therefore hold that, where a criminal defendant is charged with escape and claims that he is entitled to an instruction on the theory of duress or necessity, he must proffer evidence of a bona fide effort to surrender or return to custody as soon as the claimed duress or necessity had lost its coercive force"); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 416, n. 11 ("Our principal difference with the dissent, therefore, is not as to the &lt;i&gt;existence&lt;/i&gt; of such a defense but as to the importance of surrender as an element of it" (emphasis added)). Indeed, the Court's comment on the general availability of the necessity defense is completely unnecessary because the Government has made no such suggestion. Cf. Brief for United States 17-18 (narrowly arguing that necessity defense cannot succeed if legislature has &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*502&lt;/span&gt; already "canvassed the issue" and precluded it for a particular statute (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Court's opinion on this point is pure dictum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overbroad language of the Court's opinion is especially unfortunate given the importance of showing respect for the sovereign States that comprise our Federal Union. That respect imposes a duty on federal courts, whenever possible, to avoid or minimize conflict between federal and state law, particularly in situations in which the citizens of a State have chosen to "serve as a laboratory" in the trial of "novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country." &lt;i&gt;New State Ice Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Liebmann,&lt;/i&gt; 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). In my view, this is such a case.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; By passing Proposition 215, California voters have decided that seriously ill patients and their primary caregivers should be exempt from prosecution under state laws for cultivating and possessing marijuana if the patient's physician recommends using the drug for treatment.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; This case does not call upon the Court to deprive &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; such patients of the benefit of the necessity defense to federal prosecution, when the case itself does not involve &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; such patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional point deserves emphasis. This case does not require us to rule on the scope of the District Court's discretion to enjoin, or to refuse to enjoin, the possession of marijuana or other potential violations of the Controlled &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*503&lt;/span&gt; Substances Act by a seriously ill patient for whom the drug may be a necessity. Whether it would be an abuse of discretion for the District Court to refuse to enjoin those sorts of violations, and whether the District Court may consider the availability of the necessity defense for that sort of violator, are questions that should be decided on the authority of cases such as &lt;i&gt;Hecht Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bowles,&lt;/i&gt; 321 U. S. 321 (1944), and &lt;i&gt;Weinberger&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Romero-Barcelo,&lt;/i&gt; 456 U. S. 305 (1982), and that properly should be left "open" by this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I join the Court's judgment of reversal because I agree that a distributor of marijuana does not have a medical necessity defense under the Controlled Substances Act. I do not, however, join the dicta in the Court's opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   &lt;i&gt;Janet M. LaRue&lt;/i&gt; filed a brief for the Family Research Council as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefs of &lt;i&gt;amici curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging affirmance were filed for the State of California by &lt;i&gt;Bill Lockyer,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;David De Alba,&lt;/i&gt; Special Assistant Attorney General; for the American Civil Liberties Union et al. by &lt;i&gt;Steven R. Shapiro, Daniel P. Tokaji,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Jordan C. Budd;&lt;/i&gt; for the American Public Health Association et al. by &lt;i&gt;Daniel N. Abrahamson;&lt;/i&gt;  for the Marijuana Policy Project et al. by &lt;i&gt;Cheryl Flax-Davidson;&lt;/i&gt; for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws et al. by &lt;i&gt;R. Keith Stroup, John Wesley Hall, Jr.,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lisa B. Kemler;&lt;/i&gt; for Edward Neil Brundridge et al. by &lt;i&gt;Thomas V. Loran III;&lt;/i&gt; and for Sheriff Mark N. Dion et al. by &lt;i&gt;Julie M. Carpenter.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefs of &lt;i&gt;amici curiae&lt;/i&gt; were filed for the California Medical Association et al. by &lt;i&gt;Catherine I. Hanson&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Alice P. Mead;&lt;/i&gt; and for the Institute on Global Drug Policy of the Drug Free America Foundation et al. by &lt;i&gt;David G. Evans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;John E. Lamp.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The Government requested, and the District Court granted, an injunction that prohibited the possession of marijuana with the intent to manufacture and distribute, as well as the distribution and manufacture of marijuana. For simplicity, in this opinion, we refer to these activities collectively as distributing and manufacturing marijuana. The legal issues are the same for all of these activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The amended preliminary injunction reaffirmed that the Cooperative is generally enjoined from manufacturing, distributing, and possessing with the intent to manufacture or distribute marijuana, but it carved out an exception for cases of medical necessity. Specifically, the District Court ordered that "[t]he foregoing injunction does not apply to the distribution of cannabis by [the Cooperative] to patient-members who (1) suffer from a serious medical condition, (2) will suffer imminent harm if the patient-member does not have access to cannabis, (3) need cannabis for the treatment of the patient-member's medical condition, or need cannabis to alleviate the medical condition or symptoms associated with the medical condition, and (4) have no reasonable legal alternative to cannabis for the effective treatment or alleviation of the patient-member's medical condition or symptoms associated with the medical condition because the patient-member has tried all other legal alternatives to cannabis and the alternatives have been ineffective in treating or alleviating the patientmember's medical condition or symptoms associated with the medical condition, or the alternatives result in side effects which the patient-member cannot reasonably tolerate." App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a&#151;17a.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States appealed the District Court's order amending the preliminary injunction. At the Government's request, we stayed the order pending the appeal. 530 U. S. 1298 (2000). The Court of Appeals has postponed oral argument pending our decision in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  The Cooperative is incorrect to suggest that &lt;i&gt;Bailey&lt;/i&gt; has settled the question whether federal courts have authority to recognize a necessity defense not provided by statute. There, the Court rejected the necessity defense of a prisoner who contended that adverse prison conditions justified his prison escape. The Court held that the necessity defense is unavailable to prisoners, like Bailey, who fail to present evidence of a bona fide effort to surrender as soon as the claimed necessity had lost its coercive force. 444 U. S., at 415. It was not argued, and so there was no occasion to consider, whether the statute might be unable to bear any necessity defense at all. And although the Court noted that Congress "legislates against a background of Anglo-Saxon common law" and thus "may" have contemplated a necessity defense, the Court refused to "balanc[e] [the] harms," explaining that "we are construing an Act of Congress, not drafting it." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 415-416, n. 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  We reject the Cooperative's intimation that elimination of the defense requires an "explici[t]" statement. Brief for Respondents 21. Considering that we have never held necessity to be a viable justification for violating a federal statute, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 490, and n. 3, and that such a defense would entail a social balancing that is better left to Congress, we decline to set the bar so high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  As noted, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 490, the only express exception for schedule I drugs is the Government-approved research project, see 21 U. S. C. &#167; 823(f). Unlike drugs in other schedules, see &#167; 829, schedule I drugs cannot be dispensed under a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  The Government argues that the 1998 "sense of the Congress" resolution, 112 Stat. 2681-760 to 2681-761, supports its position that Congress has foreclosed the medical necessity defense. Entitled "Not Legalizing Marijuana for Medicinal Use," the resolution declares that "Congress continues to support the existing Federal legal process for determining the safety and efficacy of drugs and opposes efforts to circumvent this process by legalizing marijuana, and other Schedule I drugs, for medicinal use without valid scientific evidence and the approval of the Food and Drug Administration." Because we conclude that the Controlled Substances Act cannot sustain the medical necessity defense, we need not consider whether the 1998 "sense of the Congress resolution" is additional evidence of a legislative determination to eliminate the defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  Lest there be any confusion, we clarify that nothing in our analysis, or the statute, suggests that a distinction should be drawn between the prohibitions on manufacturing and distributing and the other prohibitions in the Controlled Substances Act. Furthermore, the very point of our holding is that there is no medical necessity exception to the prohibitions at issue, even when the patient is "seriously ill" and lacks alternative avenues for relief. Indeed, it is the Cooperative's argument that its patients are "seriously ill," see, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Brief for Respondents 11, 13, 17, and lacking "alternatives," see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 13. We reject the argument that these factors warrant a medical necessity exception. If we did not, we would be affirming instead of reversing the Court of Appeals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we share Justice Stevens' concern for "showing respect for the sovereign States that comprise our Federal Union." &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 502 (opinion concurring in judgment). However, we are "construing an Act of Congress, not drafting it." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bailey,&lt;/i&gt; 444 U. S. 394, 415, n. 11 (1980). Because federal courts interpret, rather than author, the federal criminal code, we are not atliberty to rewrite it. Nor are we passing today on a constitutional question, such as whether the Controlled Substances Act exceeds Congress' power under the Commerce Clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  Notwithstanding Justice Stevens' concerns, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 502-503, it is appropriate for us to address this issue because thiscase arises from a motion to modify the injunction, because the Court of Appeals held that the District Court misconstrued its equitable discretion, and because the Cooperative offers this conclusion as an alternative ground for affirmance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9]  &lt;i&gt;Hecht Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bowles,&lt;/i&gt; 321 U. S.321 (1944), for example, held that the District Court was not required to issue an injunction to restrain violations of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 and regulations thereunder when "some `other order' might be more appropriate, or at least so appear to the court." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 328 (quoting statutory provision that enabled district court to issue an injunction, a restraining order, "or other order"). &lt;i&gt;Weinberger&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Romero-Barcelo,&lt;/i&gt; 456 U. S. 305 (1982), held that a District Court had discretion not to issue an injunction precluding the United States Navy from releasing ordnance into water, but to rely on other means of ensuring compliance, including ordering the Navy to obtain a permit. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 314-318. See also &lt;i&gt;Amoco Production Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gambell,&lt;/i&gt; 480 U. S. 531, 544-546 (1987) (holding that a District Court did not err in declining to issue an injunction to bar exploratory drilling on Alaskan public lands, because the District Court's decision "did not undermine" the policy of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, 16 U. S. C. &#167; 3120, and because the Secretary of the Interior had other means of meaningfully complying with the statute).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  In any event, respondents do not fit the paradigm of a defendant who may assert necessity. The defense "traditionally covered the situation where physical forces beyond the actor's control rendered illegal conduct the lesser of two evils." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bailey,&lt;/i&gt; 444 U. S. 394, 410 (1980); see generally 1W. LaFave &amp;amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law &#167; 5.4, pp. 627-640 (1986). Respondents, on the other hand, have not been forced to confront a choice of evils&#151;violating federal law by distributing marijuana to seriously ill patients or letting those individuals suffer&#151;but have thrust that choice upon themselves by electing to become distributors for such patients. Of course, respondents also cannot claim necessity based upon the choice of evils facing seriously ill patients, as that is not the same choice respondents face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  As a result, perhaps the most glaring example of the Court's dicta is its footnote 7, where it opines that "nothing in our analysis, or the statute, suggests that a distinction should be drawn between the prohibitions on manufacturing and distributing and the other prohibitions in the Controlled Substances Act." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 494, n. 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Cf. Feeney, Bush Backs States' Rights on Marijuana: He Opposes Medical Use But Favors Local Control, Dallas Morning News, Oct. 20, 1999, p. 6A, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;1999&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;WL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;28018944&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (then-Governor Bush supporting state selfdetermination on medical marijuana use).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Since 1996, six other States&#151;Alaska, Colorado, Maine, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington&#151;have passed medical marijuana initiatives,and Hawaii has enacted a similar measure through its legislature. See Alaska Stat. Ann. &#167;&#167; 11.71.090,17.37.010 to 17.37.080 (2000); Colo. Const., Art. XVIII, &#167; 14; Haw. Rev. Stat. &#167;&#167; 329-121 to 329-128 (Supp. 2000); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 22, &#167; 2383&#151;B(5) (Supp. 2000); Nev. Const., Art. 4, &#167; 38; Ore. Rev. Stat. &#167;&#167; 475.300 to 475.346 (1999); Wash. Rev. Code &#167;&#167; 69.51A.005 to 69.51A.902 (1997 and Supp. 2000-2001).&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*558&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*559&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*560&lt;/span&gt; Breyer, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Kennedy, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined, and in which Scalia, J.,joined as to Parts I, II, and V. Scalia, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 581. Thomas, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt;  p. 586. Stevens, J., and O'Connor, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Paul R. Q. Wolfson&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Acting Solicitor General Under wood,&lt;/i&gt; former &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Ogden, Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler, David M. Cohen, Douglas N. Letter,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Anne Murphy.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steven S. Rosenthal&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;W. Stephen Smith&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ellen E. Deason.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Breyer, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Constitution's Compensation Clause guarantees federal judges a "Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office." U. S. Const., Art. III, &#167; 1. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that this Clause prevents the Government from collecting certain &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*561&lt;/span&gt; Medicare and Social Security taxes from a small number of federal judges who held office nearly 20 years ago&#151;before Congress extended the taxes to federal employees in the early 1980's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our view, the Clause does not prevent Congress from imposing a "non-discriminatory tax laid generally" upon judges and other citizens, &lt;i&gt;O'Malley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Woodrough,&lt;/i&gt; 307 U. S. 277, 282 (1939), but it does prohibit taxation that singles out judges for specially unfavorable treatment. Consequently, unlike the Court of Appeals, we conclude that Congress may apply the Medicare tax&#151;a nondiscriminatory tax&#151;to thensitting federal judges. The special retroactivity-related Social Security rules that Congress enacted in 1984, however, effectively singled out then-sitting federal judges for unfavorable treatment. Hence, like the Court of Appeals, we conclude that the Clause forbids the application of the Social Security tax to those judges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Medicare law before us is straightforward. In 1965, Congress created a Federal Medicare "hospital insurance" program and tied its financing to Social Security. See Social Security Amendments of 1965, 79 Stat. 291. The Medicare law required most American workers (whom Social Security covered) to pay an additional Medicare tax. But it did not require Federal Government employees (whom Social Security did not cover) to pay that tax. See 26 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 3121(b)(5), (6) (1982 ed.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1982, Congress, believing that "[f]ederal workers should bear a more equitable share of the costs of financing the benefits to which many of them eventually became entitled," S. Rep. No. 97-494, pt. 1, p. 378 (1982), extended both Medicare eligibility and Medicare taxes to all currently employed federal employees as well as to all newly hired federal employees, Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*562&lt;/span&gt; &#167; 278, 96 Stat. 559-563. That new law meant that (as of January 1, 1983) all federal judges, like all other federal employees and most other citizens, would have to contribute between 1.30% and 1.45% of their federal salaries to Medicare's hospital insurance system. See 26 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 3101(b)(4)&#151;(6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Social Security law before us is more complex. In 1935, Congress created the Social Security program. See Social Security Act, 49 Stat. 620. For nearly 50 years, that program covered employees in the private sector, but it did not cover Government employees. See 26 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 3121(b)(5), (6) (1982 ed.) (excluding federal employees); &#167; 3121(b)(7) (excluding state employees). In 1981, a National Commission on Social Security Reform, convened by the President and chaired by Alan Greenspan, noting the need for "action . . . To strengthen the financial status" of Social Security, recommended that Congress extend the program to cover Federal, but not state or local, Government employees. Report of the National Commission on Social Security Reform 2-1, 2-7 (Jan. 1983). In particular, the Commission recommended that Congress &lt;i&gt;require&lt;/i&gt; all incoming federal employees (those hired after January 1, 1984) to enter the Social Security system and to pay Social Security taxes. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 2-7. The Commission emphasized that "present Federal employees will &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be affected by this recommendation." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 2-8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1983, Congress enacted the Commission's recommendation into law (effective January 1, 1984) with an important exception. See Social Security Amendments of 1983, &#167; 101(b)(1), 97 Stat. 69 (amending 26 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 3121(b)(5), (6)). As the Commission had recommended, Congress &lt;i&gt;re-&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;quired&lt;/i&gt; all newly hired federal employees to participate in the Social Security program. It also &lt;i&gt;permitted,&lt;/i&gt; without requiring, almost all (about 96%) then-currently employed federal employees to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the Commission's recommendation, however, the law added an exception. That exception seemed to restrict &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*563&lt;/span&gt; the freedom of choice of the remaining 4% of all current employees. This class consisted of the President, Vice President, high-level Executive Branch employees, Members of Congress, a few other Legislative Branch employees, and all federal judges. See 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 410(a)(5)(C)&#151;(G); see also H. R. Rep. No. 98-25, p. 39 (1983); H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 98-542, p. 13 (1983) (noting that for these current federal employees "the rules are being changed in the middle of the game"). The new law seemed to &lt;i&gt;require&lt;/i&gt; this class of current federal employees to enter into the Social Security program, see 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 410(a)(5)(C)&#151;(G). But, as to almost all of these employees, the new law imposed no additional financial obligation or burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is because the new law then created an exception to the exception, see Federal Employees' Retirement Contribution Temporary Adjustment Act of 1983, &#167;&#167; 203(a)(2), 208, 97 Stat. 1107, 1111 (codified at note following 5 U. S. C. &#167; 8331). The exception to the exception said that any member of this small class of current high-level officials (4% of all thencurrent employees) who contributed to a "covered" retirement program nonetheless could choose to modify their participation in a manner that left their total payroll deduction&#151;for retirement and Social Security&#151;unchanged. A "covered" employee paying 7% of salary to a "covered" program could continue to pay that 7% and no more, in effect avoiding any additional financial obligation as a result of joining Social Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exception to the exception defined a "covered" program to include the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System&#151;a program long available to almost all federal employees&#151;as well as any other retirement system to which an employee must contribute. &#167;&#167; 203(a)(2)(A), (D). The definition of "covered" program, however, did not encompass the pension system for federal judges&#151;a system that is non contributory in respect to a judge (but contributory in respect to a spouse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*564&lt;/span&gt; The upshot is that the 1983 law was specifically aimed at extending Social Security to federal employees. It left about 96% of those who were currently employed free to choose not to participate in Social Security, thereby avoiding any increased financial obligation. It required the remaining 4% to participate in Social Security while freeing them of any added financial obligation (or additional payroll deduction) so long as they previously had participated in other contributory retirement programs. But it left those who could not participate in a contributory program without a choice. Their financial obligations (and payroll deductions) had to increase. And this last mentioned group consisted almost exclusively of federal judges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This litigation began in 1989, when eight federal judges, all appointed before 1983, sued the Government for "compensation" in the United States Claims Court. They argued that the 1983 law, in requiring them to pay Social Security taxes, violated the Compensation Clause. Initially, the Claims Court ruled against the judges on jurisdictional grounds. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Cl. Ct.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;786&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1990). The Court of Appeals reversed. 953 F. 2d 626 (CA Fed. 1992). On remand, eight more judges joined the lawsuit. They contested the extension to judges of the Medicare tax as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Federal Claims held against the judges on the merits. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Fed. Cl.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;436&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1994). The Federal Circuit reversed, ordering summary judgment for the judges as to liability. 64 F. 3d 647 (1995). The Government petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari. Some Members of this Court were disqualified from hearing the matter, and we failed to find a quorum of six Justices. See 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1. Consequently, the Court of Appeals' judgment was affirmed "with the same effect as upon affirmance by an equally divided court." 519 U. S. 801 (1996); see 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2109.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*565&lt;/span&gt; On remand from the Court of Appeals, the Court of Federal Claims found (a) that the 6-year statute of limitations, see 28 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 2401(a), 2501, barred some claims, including all Medicare claims; and (b) that, in any event, a subsequently enacted judicial salary increase promptly cured any violation, making damages minimal. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;38&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Fed. Cl.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;166&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1997). The Court of Appeals (eventually en banc) reversed both determinations. 203 F. 3d 795 (CA Fed. 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government again petitioned for certiorari. It asked this Court to consider two questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Whether Congress violated the Compensation Clause when it extended the Medicare and Social Security taxes to the salaries of sitting federal judges; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) If so, whether any such violation ended when Congress subsequently increased the salaries of all federal judges by an amount greater than the new taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the specific statutory provisions at issue and the passage of time, seven Members of this Court had (and now have) no financial stake in the outcome of this case. Consequently a quorum was, and is, available to consider the questions presented. And we granted the Government's petition for a writ of certiorari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset, the judges claim that the "law of the case" doctrine prevents us from now considering the first question presented, namely, the scope of the Compensation Clause. They note that the Government presented that same question in its petition from the Court of Appeals' earlier ruling on liability. They point out that our earlier denial of that petition for lack of a quorum had the "same effect as" an "affirmance by an equally divided court," 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2109. And they add that this Court has said that an affirmance by an equally divided Court is "conclusive and binding upon the parties as respects that controversy." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pink,&lt;/i&gt; 315 U. S. 203, 216 (1942).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*566&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Pink,&lt;/i&gt; however, concerned a case, &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Moscow Fire Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 309 U. S. 624 (1940), in which this Court had heard oral argument and apparently considered the merits prior to concluding that affirmance by an equally divided Court was appropriate. The law of the case doctrine presumes a hearing on the merits. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Quern&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jordan,&lt;/i&gt;  440 U. S. 332, 347, n. 18 (1979). This case does not involve a previous consideration of the merits. Indeed, when this case previously was before us, due to absence of a quorum, we could not consider either the merits or whether to consider those merits through grant of a writ of certiorari. This fact, along with the obvious difficulty of finding other equivalent substitute forums, convinces us that &lt;i&gt;Pink&lt;/i&gt; `s statement does not control the outcome here, that the "law of the case" doctrine does not prevent our considering both issues presented, and that we should now proceed to decide them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals upheld the judges' claim of tax immunity upon the authority of &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt; 253 U. S. 245 (1920). That case arose in 1919 when Judge Walter Evans challenged Congress' authority to include sitting federal judges within the scope of a federal income tax law that the Sixteenth Amendment had authorized a few years earlier. See Revenue Act of 1918, &#167; 213, 40 Stat. 1065 (defining "gross income" to include judicial salaries). In &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; itself, the Court held that the Compensation Clause barred application of the tax to Evans, who had been appointed a judge before Congress enacted the tax. 253 U. S., at 264. A few years later, the Court extended &lt;i&gt;Evans,&lt;/i&gt; making clear that its rationale covered not only judges appointed before Congress enacted a tax but also judges whose appointments took place after the tax had become law. See &lt;i&gt;Miles&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Graham,&lt;/i&gt; 268 U. S. 501, 509 (1925).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen years after deciding &lt;i&gt;Miles,&lt;/i&gt; this Court overruled &lt;i&gt;Miles. O'Malley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Woodrough,&lt;/i&gt; 307 U. S. 277 (1939). But, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*567&lt;/span&gt; as the Court of Appeals noted, this Court did not expressly overrule &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; itself. 64 F. 3d, at 650. The Court of Appeals added that, if "changes in judicial doctrine" had significantly undermined &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; ` holding, this "Court itself would have overruled the case." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Noting that this case is like &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; (involving judges appointed &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; enactment of the tax), not like &lt;i&gt;O'Malley&lt;/i&gt; (involving judges appointed &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; enactment of the tax), the Court of Appeals held that &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; controlled the outcome. 64 F. 3d, at 650. Hence application of both Medicare and Social Security taxes to these pre enactment judges violated the Compensation Clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals was correct in applying &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; to the instant case, given that "it is this Court's prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents." &lt;i&gt;State Oil Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Khan,&lt;/i&gt; 522 U. S. 3, 20 (1997); see also &lt;i&gt;Rodriguez de Quijas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Shearson/American Express, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989). Nonetheless, the court below, in effect, has invited us to reconsider &lt;i&gt;Evans.&lt;/i&gt; We now overrule &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; insofar as it holds that the Compensation Clause forbids Congress to apply a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory tax to the salaries of federal judges, whether or not they were appointed before enactment of the tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court's opinion in &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; began by explaining why the Compensation Clause is constitutionally important, and we begin by reaffirming that explanation. As &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; points out, 253 U. S., at 251-252, the Compensation Clause, along with the Clause securing federal judges appointments "during good Behavior," U. S. Const., Art. III, &#167; 1&#151;the practical equivalent of life tenure&#151;helps to guarantee what Alexander Hamilton called the "complete independence of the courts of justice." The Federalist No. 78, p. 466 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). Hamilton thought these guarantees necessary because the Judiciary is "beyond comparison the weakest of the three" branches of Government. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 465-466. It has "no influence over either the sword or the purse." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 465. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*568&lt;/span&gt; It has "no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; It has "neither FORCE nor WILL but merely judgment." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamilton's view, and that of many other Founders, was informed by firsthand experience of the harmful consequences brought about when a King of England "made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries." The Declaration of Independence &#182; 11. And Hamilton knew that "&lt;i&gt;a power over a man's subsistence amounts to a power over his will."&lt;/i&gt; The Federalist No. 79, at 472. For this reason, he observed, "[n]ext to permanency in office, nothing can contribute more to the independence of the judges than a fixed provision for their support." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.;&lt;/i&gt; see also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; No. 48, at 310 (J. Madison) ("[A]s the legislative department alone has access to the pockets of the people, and has . . . full discretion . . . over the pecuniary rewards of those who fill the other departments, a dependence is thus created in the latter, which gives still greater facility to encroachments of the former").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; properly added that these guarantees of compensation and life tenure exist, "not to benefit the judges," but "as a limitation imposed in the public interest." 253 U. S., at 253. They "promote the public weal," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 248, in part by helping to induce "learned" men and women "to quit the lucrative pursuits" of the private sector, 1 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *294, but more importantly by helping to secure an independence of mind and spirit necessary if judges are "to maintain that nice adjustment between individual rights and governmental powers which constitutes political liberty," W. Wilson, Constitutional Government in the United States 143 (1911).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice John Marshall pointed out why this protection is important. A judge may have to decide "between the Government and the man whom that Government is prosecuting: between the most powerful individual in the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*569&lt;/span&gt; community, and the poorest and most unpopular." Proceedings and Debates of the Virginia State Convention, of 1829&#151; 1830, p. 616 (1830). A judge's decision may affect an individual's "property, his reputation, his life, his all." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; In the "exercise of these duties," the judge must "observe the utmost fairness." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; The judge must be "perfectly and completely independent, with nothing to influence or contro[l] him but God and his conscience." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; The "greatest scourge . . . ever inflicted," Marshall thought, "was an ignorant, a corrupt, or a dependent Judiciary." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 619.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who founded the Republic recognized the importance of these constitutional principles. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Wilson, Lectures on Law (1791), in 1 Works of James Wilson 363 (J. Andrews ed. 1896) (stating that judges should be "completely independent" in "their salaries, and in their offices"); McKean, Debate in Pennsylvania Ratifying Convention, Dec. 11, 1787, in 2 Debates on the Federal Constitution 539 (J. Elliot ed. 1836) (the security of undiminished compensation disposes judges to be "more easy and independent"); see also 1 Kent, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at *294 ("[P]ermanent support" and the "tenure of their office" "is well calculated . . . to give [judges] the requisite independence"). They are no less important today than in earlier times. And the fact that we overrule &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt;  does not, in our view, diminish their importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also agree with &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; insofar as it holds that the Compensation Clause offers protections that extend beyond a legislative effort directly to diminish a judge's pay, say, by ordering a lower salary. 253 U. S., at 254. Otherwise a legislature could circumvent even the most basic Compensation Clause protection by enacting a discriminatory tax law, for example, that precisely but indirectly achieved the forbidden effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, we disagree with &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; ` application of Compensation Clause principles to the matter before it&#151;a nondiscriminatory tax that treated judges the same way it treated other citizens. &lt;i&gt;Evans'&lt;/i&gt; basic holding was that the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*570&lt;/span&gt; Compensation Clause forbids such a tax because the Clause forbids "all diminution," including "taxation," "whether for one purpose or another." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 255. The Federal Circuit relied upon this holding. 64 F. 3d, at 650. But, in our view, it is no longer sound law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, the dissenters in &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; cast the majority's reasoning into doubt. Justice Holmes, joined by Justice Brandeis, wrote that the Compensation Clause offers "no reason for exonerating" a judge "from the ordinary duties of a citizen, which he shares with all others. To require a man to pay the taxes that all other men have to pay cannot possibly be made an instrument to attack his independence as a judge." 253 U. S., at 265. Holmes analogized the "diminution" that a tax might bring about to the burden that a state law might impose upon interstate commerce. If "there was no discrimination against such commerce the tax constituted one of the ordinary burdens of government from which parties were not exempted." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 267.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For another thing, this Court's subsequent law repudiated &lt;i&gt;Evans'&lt;/i&gt; reasoning. In 1939, 14 years after &lt;i&gt;Miles&lt;/i&gt; extended &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; ` tax immunity to judges appointed after enactment of the tax, this Court retreated from that extension. See &lt;i&gt;O'Malley,&lt;/i&gt; 307 U. S., at 283 (overruling &lt;i&gt;Miles&lt;/i&gt; ). And in so doing the Court, in an opinion announced by Justice Frankfurter, adopted the reasoning of the &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; dissent. The Court said that the question was whether judges are immune "from the incidences of taxation to which everyone else within the defined classes . . . is subjected." 307 U. S., at 282. Holding that judges are not "immun[e] from sharing with their fellow citizens the material burden of the government," &lt;i&gt;ibid.,&lt;/i&gt; the Court pointed out that the legal profession had criticized &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; ` contrary conclusion, and that courts outside the United States had resolved similar matters differently, 307 U. S., at 281. And the Court concluded that "a non-discriminatory tax laid generally on net income is not, when applied to the income of a federal judge, a diminution &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*571&lt;/span&gt; of his salary within the prohibition of Article III." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 282. The Court conceded that &lt;i&gt;Miles&lt;/i&gt; had reached the opposite conclusion, but it said that &lt;i&gt;Miles&lt;/i&gt; "cannot survive." 307 U. S., at 283. Still later, this Court noted that "[b]ecause &lt;i&gt;Miles&lt;/i&gt; relied on &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gore&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, O'Malley&lt;/i&gt; must also be read to undermine the reasoning of &lt;i&gt;Evans.&lt;/i&gt; " &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Will,&lt;/i&gt; 449 U. S. 200, 227, n. 31 (1980).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and most importantly, we believe that the reasoning of Justices Holmes and Brandeis, and of this Court in &lt;i&gt;O'Malley,&lt;/i&gt; is correct. There is no good reason why a judge should not share the tax burdens borne by all citizens. We concede that this Court has held that the Legislature cannot &lt;i&gt;directly&lt;/i&gt; reduce judicial salaries even as part of an equitable effort to reduce &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; Government salaries. See 449 U. S., at 226. But a tax law, unlike a law mandating a salary reduction, affects compensation indirectly, not directly. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt;  (distinguishing between measures that directly and those that indirectly diminish judicial compensation). And those prophylactic considerations that may justify an absolute rule forbidding direct salary reductions are absent here, where indirect taxation is at issue. In practice, the likelihood that a nondiscriminatory tax represents a disguised legislative effort to influence the judicial will is virtually nonexistent. Hence, the potential threats to judicial independence that underlie the Constitution's compensation guarantee cannot justify a special judicial exemption from a commonly shared tax, not even as a preventive measure to counter those threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, we hold that the Compensation Clause does not forbid Congress to enact a law imposing a nondiscriminatory tax (including an increase in rates or a change in conditions) upon judges, whether those judges were appointed before or after the tax law in question was enacted or took effect. Insofar as &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; holds to the contrary, that case, in &lt;i&gt;O'Malley&lt;/i&gt; `s words, "cannot survive." 307 U. S., at 283.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*572&lt;/span&gt; The Government points out that the Medicare tax is just such a nondiscriminatory tax. Neither the courts below, nor the federal judges here, argue to the contrary. Hence, insofar as the Court of Appeals found that application of the Medicare tax law to federal judges is unconstitutional, we reverse its decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Social Security tax is a different matter. Respondents argue that the 1983 law imposing that tax upon thensitting judges violates the Compensation Clause, for it discriminates against judges in a manner forbidden by the Clause, even as interpreted in &lt;i&gt;O'Malley,&lt;/i&gt; not &lt;i&gt;Evans.&lt;/i&gt; Cf. &lt;i&gt;O'Malley, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 282 (stating question as whether judges are immune "from the incidences of taxation &lt;i&gt;to which everyone else within the defined classes&lt;/i&gt; . . . is subjected" (emphasis added)). After examining the statute's details, we agree with the judges that it does discriminate in a manner that the Clause forbids. Four features of the law, taken together, lead us to this conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, federal employees had remained outside the Social Security system for nearly 50 years prior to the passage of the 1983 law. Congress enacted the law pursuant to the Social Security Commission's recommendation to bring those employees within the law. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 562. And the law itself deals primarily with that subject. Thus, history, context, statutory purpose, and statutory language, taken together, indicate that the category of "federal employees" is the appropriate class against which we must measure the asserted discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the law, as applied in practice, in effect imposed a new financial obligation upon sitting judges, but it did not impose a new financial burden upon any other group of (then) current federal employees. We have previously explained why that is so. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 562-564. The law required all newly hired federal employees to join Social Security and pay related taxes. It gave 96% of all current employees &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*573&lt;/span&gt; (employed as of January 1, 1984, or earlier) total freedom to enter, or not to enter, the system as they chose. It gave the remaining 4% of all current employees the freedom to maintain their pre-1984 payroll deductions, provided that they were currently enrolled in a "covered" system. And it defined "covered" system in a way that included virtually all of that 4%, except for federal judges. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 563&#151; 564. The practical upshot is that the law permitted nearly every current federal employee, but not federal judges, to avoid the newly imposed financial obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, the law, by including sitting judges in the system, adversely affected most of them. Inclusion meant a requirement to pay a tax of about $2,000 per year, deducted from a monthly salary check. App. 49. At the same time, 95% of the then-active judges had already qualified for Social Security (due to private sector employment) before becoming judges. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 115. And participation in Social Security as judges would benefit only a minority. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 116&#151; 119 (reviewing examples of individual judges and demonstrating that participation in Social Security primarily would benefit the minority of judges who had not worked the 40 quarters necessary to be fully insured). The new law imposed a substantial cost on federal judges with little or no expectation of substantial benefit for most of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, when measured against Compensation Clause objectives, the Government's justification for the statutory distinction (between judges, who do, and other federal employees, who do not, incur additional financial obligations) is unsound. The sole justification, according to the Government, is one of "equaliz[ing]" the retirement-related obligations that pre-1983 law imposed upon judges with the retirement-related obligations that pre-1983 law imposed upon other current high-level federal employees. Brief for United States 40. Thus the Government says that the new financial burden imposed upon judges was meant to make up for the fact that the judicial retirement system is basically &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*574&lt;/span&gt; a non contributory system, while the system to which other federal employees belonged was a contributory system. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 39-40; Reply Brief for United States 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rationale, however, is the Government's and not necessarily that of Congress, which was silent on the matter. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 463 U. S. 29, 50 (1983) (expressing concern at crediting &lt;i&gt;post hoc&lt;/i&gt; explanation of agency action).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the judicial retirement system is noncontributory because it reflects the fact that the Constitution itself guarantees federal judges life tenure&#151;thereby constitutionally permitting federal judges to draw a salary for life simply by continuing to serve. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Booth&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt;  291 U. S. 339, 352 (1934) (holding that Compensation Clause protects salary of judge who has retired). That fact means that a contributory system, in all likelihood, would not work. And, of course, as of 1982, the non contributory pension salary benefits were themselves part of the judge's compensation. The 1983 statute consequently singles out judges for adverse treatment solely because of a feature required by the Constitution to preserve judicial independence. At the same time, the "equaliz[ation]" in question takes place not by offering all current federal employees (including judges) the same opportunities but by employing a statutory disadvantage which offsets a constitutionally guaranteed advantage. Hence, to accept the "justification" offered here is to permit, through similar reasoning, taxes which have the effect of weakening or eliminating those constitutional guarantees necessary to secure judicial independence, at least insofar as similar guarantees are not enjoyed by others. This point would be obvious were Congress, say, to deny some of the benefits of a tax reduction to those with constitutionally guaranteed life tenure to make up for the fact that other employees lack such tenure. Although the relationships &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*575&lt;/span&gt; here&#151;among advantages and disadvantages&#151;are less distant and more complex, the principle is similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor does the statute "equaliz[e]" with any precision. On the one hand, the then-current retirement system open to all federal employees except judges required a typical employee to contribute 7% to 8% of his or her annual salary. See generally 5 U. S. C. &#167; 8334(a)(1). In return it provided a Member of Congress, for instance, with a pension that vested after five years and increased in value (by 2.5% of the Member's average salary) with each year of service to a maximum of 80% of salary, and covered both employee and survivors. See 5 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 8339, 8341. On the other hand, the judges' retirement system (based on life tenure) required no contribution for a judge who retired at age 65 (and who met certain service requirements) to receive full salary. But the right to receive that salary did not vest until retirement. The system provided nothing for a judge who left office before age 65. Nor did the law provide any coverage for a judge's survivors. Indeed, in 1984, a judge had to contribute 4.5% of annual salary to obtain a survivor's annuity, which increased in value by 1.25% of the judge's salary per year to a maximum of 40% of salary. 28 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 376(b), (&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt; ) (1982 ed.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two systems were not equal either before or after Congress enacted the 1983 law. Before 1983, a typical married federal employee other than a judge had to contribute 7% to 8% of annual salary to receive benefits that were better in some respects (vesting period, spousal benefit) and worse in some respects (80% salary maximum) than his married judicial counterpart would receive in return for a 4.5% contribution. The 1983 law imposed an added 5.7% burden upon the judge, in return for which the typical judge received little, or no, financial benefit. Viewed purely in financial equalization terms, and as applied to typical judges, the new requirement seems to over equalize, putting the typical married judge at a financial disadvantage&#151;though &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*576&lt;/span&gt; perhaps it would produce greater equality when applied to other, less typical examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these four characteristics reveal a law that is special&#151;in its manner of singling out judges for disadvantageous treatment, in its justification as necessary to offset advantages related to constitutionally protected features of the judicial office, and in the degree of permissible legislative discretion that would have to underlie any determination that the legislation has "equalized" rather than gone too far. For these reasons the law before us is very different from the "non-discriminatory" tax that &lt;i&gt;O'Malley&lt;/i&gt; upheld. 307 U. S., at 282. Were the Compensation Clause to permit Congress to enact a discriminatory law with these features, it would authorize the Legislature to diminish, or to equalize away, those very characteristics of the Judicial Branch that Article III guarantees&#151;characteristics which, as we have said, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 568-569, the public needs to secure that judicial independence upon which its rights depend. We consequently conclude that the 1983 Social Security tax law discriminates against the Judicial Branch, in violation of the Compensation Clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government makes additional arguments in support of reversal. But we find them unconvincing. It suggests that Article III protects judges only against a reduction in stated salary, not against indirect measures that only reduce take-home pay. Brief for United States 28. In &lt;i&gt;O'Malley,&lt;/i&gt;  however, this Court, when upholding a "non-discriminatory" tax, strongly implied that the Compensation Clause would bar a discriminatory tax. 307 U. S., at 282. The commentators whose work &lt;i&gt;O'Malley&lt;/i&gt; cited said so explicitly. See Fellman, The Diminution of Judicial Salaries, 24 Iowa L. Rev. 89, 99 (1938); see also Comment, 20 Ill. L. Rev. 376, 377 (1925); Corwin, Constitutional Law in 1919-1920, 14 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 635, 642 (1920). And in &lt;i&gt;Will,&lt;/i&gt; the Court yet more strongly indicated that the Compensation Clause bars indirect efforts to reduce judges' salaries through taxes when &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*577&lt;/span&gt; those taxes discriminate. 449 U. S., at 226. Indeed, the Government itself "assume[s] that discriminatory taxation of judges would contravene fundamental principles underlying Article III, if not the [Compensation] Clause itself." Brief for United States 37, n. 27.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government also argues that there is no evidence here that Congress singled out judges for special treatment in order to intimidate, influence, or punish them. But this Court has never insisted upon such evidence. To require it is to invite legislative efforts that embody, but lack evidence of, some such intent, engendering suspicion among the branches and consequently undermining that mutual respect that the Constitution demands. Cf. Wilson, Lectures on Law, in 1 Works of James Wilson, at 364 (stating that judges "should be removed from the most distant apprehension of being affected, in their judicial character and capacity, by anything, except their own behavior and its consequences"). Nothing in the record discloses anything other than benign congressional motives. If the Compensation Clause is to offer meaningful protection, however, we cannot limit that protection to instances in which the Legislature manifests, say, direct hostility to the Judiciary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Government correctly points out that the law disfavored not only judges but also the President of the United States and certain Legislative Branch employees. As far as we can determine, however, all Legislative Branch employees were free to join a covered system, and the record provides us with no example of any current Legislative Branch employee who had failed to do so. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 16-17, 37-38. The President's pension is non contributory. See note following 3 U. S. C. &#167; 102. And the President himself, like the judges, is protected against diminution in his "[c]ompensation." See U. S. Const., Art. II, &#167; 1. These facts may help establish congressional good faith. But, as we have said, we do not doubt that good faith. And we do not see why, otherwise, the separate and special example &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*578&lt;/span&gt; of that single individual, the President, should make a critical difference here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that, insofar as the 1983 statute required then-sitting judges to join the Social Security system and pay Social Security taxes, that statute violates the Compensation Clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;V&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The second question presented is whether the "constitutional violation ended when Congress increased the statutory salaries of federal judges by an amount greater than the amount [of the Social Security] taxes deducted from respondents' judicial salaries." Pet. for Cert. I.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government argues for an affirmative answer. It points to a statutory salary increase that all judges received in 1984. It says that this increase, subsequent to the imposition of Social Security taxes on judges' salaries, cured any earlier unconstitutional diminution of salaries in a lesser amount. Otherwise, if "Congress improperly reduced judges' salaries from $140,000" per year "to $130,000" per year, the judges would be able to collect the amount of the improper reduction, here $10,000, forever&#151;even if Congress cured the improper reduction by raising salaries $20,000, to $150,000, a year later. Reply Brief for United States 18. To avoid this consequence, the Government argues, we should simply look to the fact of a later salary increase "whether or not one of Congress's purposes in increasing the salaries" was "to terminate the constitutional violation." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how could we always decide whether a later salary increase terminates a constitutional violation without examining the purpose of that increase? Imagine a violation that affected only a few. To accept the Government's position would leave those few at a permanent salary disadvantage. If, for example, Congress reduced the salaries of one group &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*579&lt;/span&gt; of judges by 20%, a later increase of 30% applicable to all judges would leave the first group permanently 20% behind. And a pay cut that left those judges at a permanent disadvantage would perpetuate the very harm that the Compensation Clause seeks to prevent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals consequently examined the context in which the later pay increases took place in order to determine their relation to the earlier Compensation Clause violation. It found "nothing to suggest" that the later salary increase at issue here sought "to make whole the losses sustained by the pre-1983 judges." 185 F. 3d, at 1362-1363. The Government presents no evidence to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relevant economic circumstances surrounding the 1984, and subsequent, salary increases include inflation sufficiently serious to erode the real value of judicial salaries and salary increases insufficient to maintain real salaries or real compensation parity with many other private-sector employees. See Report of 1989 Commission on Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Salaries, Hearings before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 12-13 (1989) (testimony of Lloyd Cutler regarding effect of inflation on judges' salaries since 1969). For instance, while consumer prices rose 363% between 1969 and 1999, salaries in the private sector rose 421%, and salaries for district judges rose 253%. See American Bar Association, Federal Judicial Pay Erosion 11 (Feb. 2001). These figures strongly suggest that the judicial salary increases simply reflected a congressional effort to restore both to judges and to Members of Congress themselves some, but not all, of the real compensation that inflation had eroded. Those salary increases amounted to a congressional effort to adjust judicial salaries to reflect "fluctuations in the value of money," The Federalist No. 79, at 473 (A. Hamilton)&#151;the kind of adjustment that the Founders believed "may be requisite," McKean, Debate in Pennsylvania Ratifying Convention, Dec. 11, 1787, in 2 Debates on the Federal Constitution, at 539; see &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*580&lt;/span&gt; also Rosenn, The Constitutional Guaranty Against Diminution of Judicial Compensation, 24 UCLA L. Rev. 308, 314&#151; 315 (1976).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have found nothing to the contrary. And we therefore agree with the Court of Appeals' similar conclusion. 185 F. 3d, at 1363 ("[E]verything in the record" suggests that the increase was meant to halt "the slide in purchasing power resulting from continued and unadjusted-for inflation").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government says that a circumstance-specific approach may prove difficult to administer. Brief for United States 43. And we concede that examining the circumstances in order to determine whether there is or is not a relation between an earlier violation and a later increase is more complex than the Government's proposed automatic approach. But we see no reason why such relief as damages or an exemption from Social Security would prove unworkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Government looks to our decision in &lt;i&gt;Will&lt;/i&gt; for support. In that case, federal judges challenged the constitutionality of certain legislative "freezes" that Congress had imposed upon earlier enacted Government-wide cost-ofliving salary adjustments. The Court found a Compensation Clause violation in respect to the freeze for what was designated Year One (where Congress had rescinded an earlier voted 4.8% salary increase). &lt;i&gt;Will,&lt;/i&gt; 449 U. S., at 225&#151; 226. The Government points out that the &lt;i&gt;Will&lt;/i&gt; Court "noted that Congress, later in that fiscal year, enacted a statutory increase in judges' salaries that exceeded the salaries that judges would have received" without the rescission. Brief for United States 41. And the Government adds that "it was unquestioned in &lt;i&gt;Will&lt;/i&gt; " that the judges could not receive damages for the time subsequent to this later enactment. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 41-42.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Will&lt;/i&gt; Year One example, however, shows only that, in the circumstances, and unlike the case before us, the later salary increase &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; related to the earlier salary diminishment. Regardless, the very fact that the matter was "unquestioned" &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*581&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Will&lt;/i&gt; shows that it was not argued. See 449 U. S., at 206, n. 3 (noting that the judges' complaint sought relief for Year One's diminution only up to the moment of the subsequent salary increase). Hence the Court did not decide the matter now before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that later statutory salary increases did not cure the preceding unconstitutional harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;VI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insofar as the Court of Appeals found the application of Medicare taxes to the salaries of judges taking office before 1983 unconstitutional, its judgment is reversed. Insofar as that court found the application of Social Security taxes to the salaries of judges taking office before 1984 unconstitutional, its judgment is affirmed. We also affirm the Court of Appeals' determination that the 1984 salary increase received by federal judges did not cure the Compensation Clause violation. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens and Justice O'Connor took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Scalia, concurring in part and dissenting in part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with the Court that extending the Social Security tax to sitting Article III judges in 1984 violated Article III's Compensation Clause. I part paths with the Court on the issue of extending the Medicare tax to federal judges in 1983, which I think was also unconstitutional.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*582&lt;/span&gt; I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an initial matter, I think the Court is right in concluding that &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt; 253 U. S. 245 (1920)&#151;holding that new taxes of general applicability cannot be applied to sitting Article III judges&#151;is no longer good law, and should be overruled. We went out of our way in &lt;i&gt;O'Malley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Woodrough,&lt;/i&gt; 307 U. S. 277, 280-281 (1939), to catalog criticism of &lt;i&gt;Evans,&lt;/i&gt; and subsequently recognized, in &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Will,&lt;/i&gt; 449 U. S. 200, 227, and n. 31 (1980), that &lt;i&gt;O'Malley&lt;/i&gt; had "undermine[d] the reasoning of &lt;i&gt;Evans.&lt;/i&gt; " The Court's decision today simply recognizes what should be obvious: that &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; has not only been undermined, but has in fact collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My disagreement with the Court arises from its focus upon the issue of discrimination, which turns out to be dispositive with respect to the Medicare tax. The Court holds "that the Compensation Clause does not forbid Congress to enact a law imposing a nondiscriminatory tax . . . upon judges, whether those judges were appointed before or after the tax law in question was enacted or took effect." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 571. Since "the Medicare tax is just such a nondiscriminatory tax," the Court concludes that "application of [that] tax law to federal judges is [c]onstitutional." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 572.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we are dealing here with a "Compensation Clause," not a "Discrimination Clause." See U. S. Const., Art. III, &#167; 1 ("The Judges . . . shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office"). As we have said, "the Constitution makes no exceptions for `nondiscriminatory' reductions" in judicial compensation, &lt;i&gt;Will, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 226. A reduction in compensation is a reduction in compensation, even if all federal employees are subjected to the same cut. The discrimination criterion that the Court uses would make sense if the only purpose of the Compensation Clause were &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*583&lt;/span&gt; to prevent invidious (and possibly coercive) action against judges. But as the Court acknowledges, the Clause "`promote[s] the public weal' . . . by helping to induce `learned' men and women to `quit the lucrative pursuits' of the private sector," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 568 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Evans, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 248; 1 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *294). That inducement would not exist if Congress could cut judicial salaries so long as it did not do so discriminatorily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the question comes down to, then, is (1) whether exemption from a certain tax can constitute part of a judge's "compensation," and (2) if so, whether exemption from the Medicare tax was part of the judges' compensation here. The answer to the more general question seems to me obviously yes. Surely the term "compensation" refers to the entire "package" of benefits&#151;not just cash, but retirement benefits, medical care, &lt;i&gt;and exemption from taxation if that is part of the employment package.&lt;/i&gt; It is simply unreasonable to think that "$150,000 a year tax-free" (if that was the bargain struck) is not higher compensation than "$150,000 a year subject to taxes." Ask the employees of the World Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more difficult question&#151;though far from an insoluble one&#151;is &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt; an exemption from tax constitutes compensation. In most cases, the presence or absence of taxation upon wages, like the presence or absence of many other factors within the control of government&#151;inflation, for example, or the rates charged by government-owned utilities, or import duties that increase consumer prices&#151;affects the &lt;i&gt;value&lt;/i&gt; of compensation, but is not an element of compensation itself. The Framers had this distinction well in mind. Hamilton, for example, wrote that as a result of "the fluctuations in the value of money," "[i]t was . . . necessary to leave it to the discretion of the legislature to vary its provisions" for judicial compensation. The Federalist No. 79, p. 473 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961); see also &lt;i&gt;Will, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 227 (the Constitution "placed faith in the integrity and sound judgment of the elected representatives to enact increases" in judicial salaries &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*584&lt;/span&gt; to account for inflation). Since Hamilton thought that the Compensation Clause "put it out of the power of [Congress] to change the condition of the individual [judge] for the worse," The Federalist No. 79, at 473, he obviously believed that inflation does not diminish compensation as that term is used in the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This distinction between Government action affecting compensation and Government action affecting the &lt;i&gt;value&lt;/i&gt; of compensation was the basis for our statement in &lt;i&gt;O'Malley, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 282, that "[t]o subject [judges] to a general tax is merely to recognize that judges are also citizens, and that their particular function in government does not generate an immunity from sharing with their fellow citizens the material burden of the government . . . ." I agree with the Court, therefore, that &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; was wrongly decided&#151;not, however, because in &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; there was no discrimination, but because in &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; the universal application of the tax &lt;i&gt;demonstrated&lt;/i&gt; that the Government was not reducing the compensation of its judges but was acting as sovereign rather than employer, imposing a general tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just as it is clear that a federal employee's sharing of a tax-free status that all citizens enjoy is not compensation (and elimination of that tax-free status not a reduction in compensation), so also it is clear that a tax-free status conditioned on federal employment &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; compensation, and its elimination a reduction. The Court apparently acknowledges that if a tax is &lt;i&gt;imposed&lt;/i&gt; on the basis of federal employment (an income tax, for example, payable only by federal judges) it would constitute a &lt;i&gt;reduction&lt;/i&gt; in compensation. It is impossible to understand why a tax that is &lt;i&gt;suspended&lt;/i&gt; on the basis of federal employment (an exemption from federal income tax for federal judges) does not constitute the &lt;i&gt;conferral&lt;/i&gt; of compensation&#151;in which case its elimination is a &lt;i&gt;reduction,&lt;/i&gt; whether or not federal judges end up being taxed just like other citizens. Only converting the Compensation &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*585&lt;/span&gt; Clause into a Discrimination Clause can explain a contrary conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this, of course, is what has been achieved by the targeted extension of the Medicare tax to federal employees who were previously exempt. It may well be that, in some abstract sense, they are not being "discriminated against," since they end up being taxed like other citizens; but this does not alter the fact that, since exemption from the tax was part of their employment package&#151;since they had an employment expectation of a preferential exemption from taxation&#151;their &lt;i&gt;compensation&lt;/i&gt; was being reduced. One of the benefits of being a federal judge (or any federal employee) had, prior to 1982, been an exemption from the Medicare tax. This benefit Congress took away, much as a private employer might terminate a contractual commitment to pay Medicare taxes on behalf of its employees. The latter would clearly be a cut in compensation, and so is the former.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Had Congress simply imposed the Medicare tax on its own employees (including judges) at the time it introduced that tax for other working people, no benefit of federal employment would have been reduced, because, with respect to the newly introduced tax, none had ever existed. But an extension to federal employees of a tax from which they had previously been exempt &lt;i&gt;by reason of their employment status&lt;/i&gt;  seems to me a flat-out reduction of federal employment compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*586&lt;/span&gt; III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As should be clear from the above, though I agree with the Court that the extension of the Social Security tax to federal judges runs afoul of the Compensation Clause, I disagree with the Court's grounding of this holding on the discriminatory manner in which the extension occurred. In this part of its opinion, however, the Court's anti discrimination rationale is slightly different from that which appeared in its discussion of the Medicare tax. There, the focus was on discrimination compared with ordinary citizens; here, the focus is on discrimination vis-&#224;-vis other federal employees. (As the Court explains, federal judges, unlike nearly all other federal employees, were not given the opportunity to opt out of paying the tax.) On my analysis, it would not matter if every federal employee had been made subject to the Social Security tax along with judges, so long as one of the previous entitlements of their federal employment had been exemption from that tax. Federal judges, unlike all other federal employees except the President, see Art. II, &#167; 1, cl. 7, cannot, consistent with the Constitution, have their compensation diminished. If this case involved salary cuts to pay for Social Security, rather than taxes to pay for Social Security, the irrelevance of whether other federal employees were covered by the operative legislation would be clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I join in the judgment that extension of the Social Security tax to sitting Article III judges was unconstitutional. I would affirm the Federal Circuit's holding that extension of the Medicare tax was unconstitutional as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this Court was correct in &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gore,&lt;/i&gt; 253 U. S. 245 (1920), when it held that any tax that reduces a judge's &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*587&lt;/span&gt; net compensation violates Article III of the Constitution. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   Briefs of &lt;i&gt;amici curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging affirmance were filed for the Federal Judges Association by &lt;i&gt;Kevin M. Forde&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Richard J.

&lt;p&gt;[1]  I agree with the Court, see Part II, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; that the law-of-the-case doctrine does not bar our consideration of the merits. I also join the Court in holding, see Part V, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; that any constitutional violation was not remedied by subsequent salary increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  As the Court explains, the purpose of the Medicare tax extension was to ensure that federal workers "bear a more equitable share of the costs of financing the benefits to which many of them eventually became entitled" by reason of their own or their spouses' private-sector employment. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 561 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).As with the Social Security tax, therefore, the Medicare tax aspect of this case does not present the situation in which a tax exemption has been eliminated in return forsome other benefit, different in kind but equivalent invalue. Cf. &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 573 ("[P]articipation in Social Security as judges would benefit only a minority").&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*589&lt;/span&gt; Breyer, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Paul M. Dodyk&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs was &lt;i&gt;William R. Jentes.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Louis R. Cohen&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Jonathan J. Frankel, David B. Wilson,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Jeffrey A. Chase.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matthew D. Roberts&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the Securities and Exchange Commission as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging affirmance. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Acting Solicitor General Under wood, Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler, David M. Becker, Meyer Eisenberg, Jacob H. Stillman, Katharine B. Gresham,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Susan S. McDonald.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Breyer, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This securities fraud action focuses upon a company that sold an option to buy stock while secretly intending never to honor the option. The question before us is whether this conduct violates &#167; 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*590&lt;/span&gt; 1934, which prohibits using "any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance" "in connection with the purchase or sale of any security." 48 Stat. 891, 15 U. S. C. &#167; 78j(b); see also 17 CFR &#167; 240.10b&#151;5 (2000). We conclude that it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent United International Holdings, Inc., a Colorado-based company, sued petitioner The Wharf (Holdings) Limited, a Hong Kong firm, in Colorado's Federal District Court. United said that in October 1992 Wharf had sold it an option to buy 10% of the stock of a new Hong Kong cable television system. But, United alleged, at the time of the sale Wharf secretly intended not to permit United to exercise the option. United claimed that Wharf's conduct amounted to a fraud "in connection with the . . . sale of [a] security," prohibited by &#167; 10(b), and violated numerous state laws as well. A jury found in United's favor. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit upheld that verdict. 210 F. 3d 1207 (2000). And we granted certiorari to consider whether the dispute fell within the scope of &#167; 10(b).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relevant facts, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict winner, United, are as follows. In 1991, the Hong Kong Government announced that it would accept bids for the award of an exclusive license to operate a cable system in Hong Kong. Wharf decided to prepare a bid. Wharf's chairman, Peter Woo, instructed one of its managing directors, Stephen Ng, to find a business partner with cable system experience. Ng found United. And United sent several employees to Hong Kong to help prepare Wharf's application, negotiate contracts, design the system, and arrange financing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United asked to be paid for its services with a right to invest in the cable system if Wharf should obtain the license. During August and September 1992, while United's employees were at work helping Wharf, Wharf and United negotiated about the details of that payment. Wharf prepared a &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*591&lt;/span&gt; draft letter of intent that contemplated giving United the right to become a co-investor, owning 10% of the system. But the parties did not sign the letter of intent. And in September, when Wharf submitted its bid, it told the Hong Kong authorities that Wharf would be the system's initial sole owner, Lodging to App. AY-4, although Wharf would also "consider" allowing United to become an investor, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at AY-6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early October 1992, Ng met with a United representative, who told Ng that United would continue to help only if Wharf gave United an enforceable right to invest. Ng then orally granted United an option with the following terms: (1) United had the right to buy 10% of the future system's stock; (2) the price of exercising the option would be 10% of the system's capital requirements minus the value of United's previous services (including expenses); (3) United could exercise the option only if it showed that it could fund its 10% share of the capital required for at least the first 18 months; and (4) the option would expire if not exercised within six months of the date that Wharf received the license. The parties continued to negotiate about how to write documents that would embody these terms, but they never reduced the agreement to writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 1993, Hong Kong awarded the cable franchise to Wharf. United raised $66 million designed to help finance its 10% share. In July or August 1993, United told Wharf that it was ready to exercise its option. But Wharf refused to permit United to buy any of the system's stock. Contemporaneous internal Wharf documents suggested that Wharf had never intended to carry out its promise. For example, a few weeks before the key October 1992 meeting, Ng had prepared a memorandum stating that United wanted a right to invest that it could exercise if it was able to raise the necessary capital. A handwritten note by Wharf's Chairman Woo replied, "No, no, no, we don't accept that." App. DT-187; Lodging to App. AI-1. In September 1993, after &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*592&lt;/span&gt; meeting with the Wharf board to discuss United's investment in the cable system, Ng wrote to another Wharf executive, "How do we get out?" &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at CY-1. In December 1993, after United had filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) representing that United was negotiating the acquisition of a 10% interest in the cable system, an internal Wharf memo stated that "[o]ur next move should be to claim that our directors got quite &lt;i&gt;upset&lt;/i&gt;  over these representations . . . . Publicly, we &lt;i&gt;do not&lt;/i&gt; acknowledge [United's] opportunity" to acquire the 10% interest. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at DF-1 (emphasis in original). In the margin of a December 1993 letter from United discussing its expectation of investing in the cable system, Ng wrote, "[B]e careful, must deflect this! [H]ow?" &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at DI-1. Other Wharf documents referred to the need to "back ped[al]," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at DG-1, and "stall," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at DJ-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These documents, along with other evidence, convinced the jury that Wharf, through Ng, had orally sold United an option to purchase a 10% interest in the future cable system while secretly intending not to permit United to exercise the option, in violation of &#167; 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and various state laws. The jury awarded United compensatory damages of $67 million and, in light of "circumstances of fraud, malice, or willful and wanton conduct," App. EM-18, punitive damages of $58.5 million on the state-law claims. As we have said, the Court of Appeals upheld the jury's award. 210 F. 3d 1207 (CA10 2000). And we granted certiorari to determine whether Wharf's oral sale of an option it intended not to honor is prohibited by &#167; 10(b).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act makes it "unlawful for any person . . . [t]o use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security . . . , any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*593&lt;/span&gt; such rules and regulations as the [SEC] may prescribe." 15 U. S. C. &#167; 78j.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursuant to this provision, the SEC has promulgated Rule 10b&#151;5. That Rule forbids the use, "in connection with the purchase or sale of any security," of (1) "any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud"; (2) "any untrue statement of a material fact"; (3) the omission of "a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made . . . not misleading"; or (4) any other "act, practice, or course of business" that "operates . . . as a fraud or deceit." 17 CFR &#167; 240.10b&#151;5 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To succeed in a Rule 10b&#151;5 suit, a private plaintiff must show that the defendant used, in connection with the purchase or sale of a security, one of the four kinds of manipulative or deceptive devices to which the Rule refers, and must also satisfy certain other requirements not at issue here. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 15 U. S. C. &#167; 78j (requiring the "use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange"); &lt;i&gt;Ernst &amp;amp; Ernst&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hochfelder,&lt;/i&gt; 425 U. S. 185, 193 (1976) (requiring scienter, meaning "intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud"); &lt;i&gt;Basic Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Levinson,&lt;/i&gt; 485 U. S. 224, 231-232 (1988) (requiring that any misrepresentation be material); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 243 (requiring that the plaintiff sustain damages through reliance on the misrepresentation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In deciding whether the Rule covers the circumstances present here, we must assume that the "security" at issue is not the cable system stock, but the option to purchase that stock. That is because the Court of Appeals found that Wharf conceded this point. 210 F. 3d, at 1221 ("Wharf does not contest on appeal the classification of the option as a security"). That concession is consistent with the language of the Securities Exchange Act, which defines "security" to include both "any . . . option . . . on any security" and "any. . . right to . . . purchase" stock. 15 U. S. C. &#167; 78c(a)(10) (1994 ed., Supp. V); see also &lt;i&gt;Blue Chip Stamps&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Manor Drug Stores,&lt;/i&gt; 421 U. S. 723, 751 (1975) ("[H]olders of . . . options, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*594&lt;/span&gt; and other contractual rights or duties to purchase . . . securities" are "`purchasers' . . . of securities for purposes of Rule 10b&#151;5"). And Wharf's current effort to deny the concession, by pointing to an ambiguous statement in its Court of Appeals reply brief, comes too late and is unconvincing. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 16, n. 8 (citing Reply Brief for Appellants in Nos. 97-1421, 98-1002 (CA10), pp. 5-6). Consequently, we must decide whether Wharf's secret intent not to honor the option it sold United amounted to a misrepresentation (or other conduct forbidden by the Rule) in connection with the sale of the option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wharf argues that its conduct falls outside the Rule's scope for two basic reasons. First, Wharf points out that its agreement to grant United an option to purchase shares in the cable system was an oral agreement. And it says that &#167; 10(b) does not cover oral contracts of sale. Wharf points to &lt;i&gt;Blue Chip Stamps,&lt;/i&gt; in which this Court construed the Act's "purchase or sale" language to mean that only "actual purchasers and sellers of securities" have standing to bring a private action for damages. See 421 U. S., at 730-731. Wharf notes that the Court's interpretation of the Act flowed in part from the need to protect defendants against lawsuits that "turn largely on which oral version of a series of occurrences the jury may decide to credit." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 742. And it claims that an oral purchase or sale would pose a similar problem of proof and thus should not satisfy the Rule's "purchase or sale" requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blue Chip Stamps,&lt;/i&gt; however, involved the very different question whether the Act protects a person who did not actually buy securities, but who might have done so had the seller told the truth. The Court held that the Act does not cover such a potential buyer, in part for the reason that Wharf states. But United is not a potential buyer; by providing Wharf with its services, it actually bought the option that Wharf sold. And &lt;i&gt;Blue Chip Stamps&lt;/i&gt; said nothing to suggest that oral purchases or sales fall outside the scope of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*595&lt;/span&gt; the Act. Rather, the Court's concern was about "the abuse potential and proof problems inherent in suits by investors who neither bought nor sold, but asserted they would have traded absent fraudulent conduct by others." &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;O'Hagan,&lt;/i&gt; 521 U. S. 642, 664 (1997). Such a "potential purchase" claim would rest on facts, including the plaintiff's state of mind, that might be "totally unknown and unknowable to the defendant," depriving the jury of "the benefit of weighing the plaintiff's version against the defendant's version." &lt;i&gt;Blue Chip Stamps, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 746. An actual sale, even if oral, would not create this problem, because both parties would be able to testify as to whether the relevant events had occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither is there any other convincing reason to interpret the Act to exclude oral contracts as a class. The Act itself says that it applies to "any contract" for the purchase or sale of a security. 15 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 78c(a)(13), (14). Oral contracts for the sale of securities are sufficiently common that the Uniform Commercial Code and statutes of frauds in every State now consider them enforceable. See U. C. C. &#167; 8-113 (Supp. 2000) ("A contract . . . for the sale or purchase of a security is enforceable whether or not there is a writing signed or record authenticated by a party against whom enforcement is sought"); see also 2C U. L. A. 77-81 (Supp. 2000) (table of enactments of U. C. C. Revised Art. 8 (amended 1994)) (noting adoption of &#167; 8-113, with minor variations, by all States except Rhode Island and South Carolina); R. I. Gen. Laws &#167; 6A-8-322 (Supp. 1999) (repealed effective July 1, 2001) (making oral contracts for the sale of securities enforceable); &#167; 6A-8-113 (2000 Cum. Supp.) (effective July 1, 2001) (same); S. C. Code Ann. &#167; 36-8&#151;113 (Supp. 2000) (same); U. C. C. &#167; 8-113 Comment (Supp. 2000) ("[T]he statute of frauds is unsuited to the realities of the securities business"). Any exception for oral sales of securities would significantly limit the Act's coverage, thereby undermining its basic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*596&lt;/span&gt; Wharf makes a related but narrower argument that the Act does not encompass oral contracts of sale that are unenforceable under state law. But we do not reach that issue. The Court of Appeals held that Wharf's sale of the option was not covered by the then-applicable Colorado statute of frauds, Colo. Rev. Stat. &#167; 4-8&#151;319 (repealed 1996), and hence was enforceable under state law. Though Wharf disputes the correctness of that holding, we ordinarily will not consider such a state-law issue, and we decline to do so here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, Wharf argues that a secret reservation not to permit the exercise of an option falls outside &#167; 10(b) because it does not "relat[e] to the value of a security purchase or the consideration paid"; hence it does "not implicate [&#167; 10(b)'s] policy of full disclosure." Brief for Petitioners 25, 26 (emphasis deleted). But even were it the case that the Act covers only misrepresentations likely to affect the value of securities, Wharf's secret reservation was such a misrepresentation. To sell an option while secretly intending not to permit the option's exercise is misleading, because a buyer normally presumes good faith. Cf., &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 530, Comment &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; (1976) ("Since a promise necessarily carries with it the implied assertion of an intention to perform[,] it follows that a promise made without such an intention is fraudulent"). For similar reasons, the secret reservation misled United about the option's value. Since Wharf did not intend to honor the option, the option was, unbeknownst to United, valueless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Wharf supports its claim for an exemption from the statute by characterizing this case as a "disput[e] over the ownership of securities." Brief for Petitioners 24. Wharf expresses concern that interpreting the Act to allow recovery in a case like this one will permit numerous plaintiffs to bring federal securities claims that are in reality no more than ordinary state breach-of-contract claims&#151;actions that lie outside the Act's basic objectives. United's claim, however, is not simply that Wharf failed to carry out a promise &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*597&lt;/span&gt; to sell it securities. It is a claim that Wharf sold it a security (the option) while secretly intending from the very beginning not to honor the option. And United proved that secret intent with documentary evidence that went well beyond evidence of a simple failure to perform. Moreover, Wharf has not shown us that its concern has proved serious as a practical matter in the past. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Threadgill&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Black,&lt;/i&gt;  730 F. 2d 810, 811-812 (CADC) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; (suggesting in 1984 that contracting to sell securities with the secret reservation not to perform one's obligations under the contract violates &#167; 10(b)). Nor does Wharf persuade us that it is likely to prove serious in the future. Cf. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-67, &#167; 21D(b)(2), 109 Stat. 747, codified at 15 U. S. C. &#167; 78u&#151;4(b)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. V) (imposing, beginning in 1995, stricter pleading requirements in private securities fraud actions that, among other things, require that a complaint "state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required [fraudulent] state of mind").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is &lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;center&gt;No. 99-1848.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;United States Supreme Court.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued February 27, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided May 29, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*599&lt;/span&gt; Rehnquist, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined. Scalia, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Thomas, J., joined, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 610. Ginsburg, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens, Souter, and Breyer, JJ., joined, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 622.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Webster J. Arceneaux III&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs was &lt;i&gt;Brian A. Glasser.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beth S. Brinkmann&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal. With her on the brief were former &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Acting Solicitor General Under wood, Assistant Attorney General Lee, Jeffrey P. Minear, Jessica Dunsay Silver,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kevin K. Russell.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;David P. Cleek,&lt;/i&gt; Senior Deputy Attorney General of West Virginia, argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Darrell V. McGraw, Jr.,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*600&lt;/span&gt; Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous federal statutes allow courts to award attorney's fees and costs to the "prevailing party." The question presented here is whether this term includes a party that has failed to secure a judgment on the merits or a court-ordered consent decree, but has nonetheless achieved the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant's conduct. We hold that it does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc., which operates care homes that provide assisted living to their residents, failed an inspection by the West Virginia Office of the State Fire Marshal because some of the residents were incapable of "self-preservation" as defined under state law. See W. Va. Code &#167;&#167; 16-5H-1, 16-5H-2 (1998) (requiring that all residents of residential board and care homes be capable of "self-preservation," or capable of moving themselves "from situations involving imminent danger, such as fire"); W. Va. Code of State Rules, tit. 87, ser. 1, &#167; 14.07(1) (1995) (same). On October 28, 1997, after receiving cease-and-desist orders requiring the closure of its residential care facilities within 30 days, Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc., on behalf of itself and other similarly situated homes and residents (hereinafter petitioners), brought suit in the United States &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*601&lt;/span&gt; District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia against the State of West Virginia, two of its agencies, and 18 individuals (hereinafter respondents), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; that the "self-preservation" requirement violated the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA), 102 Stat. 1619, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 3601 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 104 Stat. 327, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12101 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondents agreed to stay enforcement of the cease-anddesist orders pending resolution of the case and the parties began discovery. In 1998, the West Virginia Legislature enacted two bills eliminating the "self-preservation" requirement, see S. 627, I 1998 W. Va. Acts 983-986 (amending regulations); H. R. 4200, II 1998 W. Va. Acts 1198-1199 (amending statute), and respondents moved to dismiss the case as moot. The District Court granted the motion, finding that the 1998 legislation had eliminated the allegedly offensive provisions and that there was no indication that the West Virginia Legislature would repeal the amendments.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners requested attorney's fees as the "prevailing party" under the FHAA, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 3613(c)(2) ("[T]he court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney's fee and costs"), and ADA, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12205 ("[T]he court . . . , in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney's fee, including litigation expenses, and costs"). Petitioners argued that they were entitled to attorney's fees under the "catalyst theory," which posits that a plaintiff is a "prevailing party" if it achieves the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant's conduct. Although &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*602&lt;/span&gt; most Courts of Appeals recognize the "catalyst theory,"&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected it in &lt;i&gt;S-1 and S-2&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State Bd. of Ed. of N. C.,&lt;/i&gt; 21 F. 3d 49, 51 (1994) (en banc) ("A person may not be a `prevailing party' . . . except by virtue of having obtained an enforceable judgment, consent decree, or settlement giving some of the legal relief sought"). The District Court accordingly denied the motion and, for the same reason, the Court of Appeals affirmed in an unpublished, &lt;i&gt;per curiam&lt;/i&gt; opinion. Judgt. order reported at 203 F. 3d 819 (CA4 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resolve the disagreement amongst the Courts of Appeals, we granted certiorari, 530 U. S. 1304 (2000), and now affirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, parties are ordinarily required to bear their own attorney's fees&#151;the prevailing party is not entitled to collect from the loser. See &lt;i&gt;Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wilderness Society,&lt;/i&gt; 421 U. S. 240, 247 (1975). Under this "American Rule," we follow "a general practice of not awarding fees to a prevailing party absent explicit statutory authority." &lt;i&gt;Key Tronic Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt;  511 U. S. 809, 819 (1994). Congress, however, has authorized the award of attorney's fees to the "prevailing party" in numerous statutes in addition to those at issue here, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 259, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000e&#151; 5(k), the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1975, 89 Stat. 402, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1973&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt; (e), and the Civil Rights Attorney's &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*603&lt;/span&gt; Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2641, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1988. See generally &lt;i&gt;Marek&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chesny,&lt;/i&gt; 473 U. S. 1, 43-51 (1985) (Appendix to opinion of Brennan, J., dissenting).&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In designating those parties eligible for an award of litigation costs, Congress employed the term "prevailing party," a legal term of art. Black's Law Dictionary 1145 (7th ed. 1999) defines "prevailing party" as "[a] party in whose favor a judgment is rendered, regardless of the amount of damages awarded . &#151; Also termed &lt;i&gt;successful party.&lt;/i&gt; " This view that a "prevailing party" is one who has been awarded some relief by the court can be distilled from our prior cases.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Hanrahan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hampton,&lt;/i&gt; 446 U. S. 754, 758 (1980) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; we reviewed the legislative history of &#167; 1988 and found that "Congress intended to permit the interim award of counsel fees only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims." Our "[r]espect for ordinary language requires that a plaintiff receive at least some relief on the merits of his claim before he can be said to prevail." &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*604&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Hewitt&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Helms,&lt;/i&gt; 482 U. S. 755, 760 (1987). We have held that even an award of nominal damages suffices under this test. See &lt;i&gt;Farrar&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hobby,&lt;/i&gt; 506 U. S. 103 (1992).&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to judgments on the merits, we have held that settlement agreements enforced through a consent decree may serve as the basis for an award of attorney's fees. See &lt;i&gt;Maher&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gagne,&lt;/i&gt; 448 U. S. 122 (1980). Although a consent decree does not always include an admission of liability by the defendant, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 126, n. 8, it nonetheless is a court-ordered "chang[e] [in] the legal relationship between [the plaintiff] and the defendant." &lt;i&gt;Texas State Teachers Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Garland Independent School Dist.,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 782, 792 (1989) (citing &lt;i&gt;Hewitt, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 760-761, and &lt;i&gt;Rhodes&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Stewart,&lt;/i&gt; 488 U. S. 1, 3-4 (1988) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; ).&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; These decisions, taken together, establish that enforceable judgments on the merits and court-ordered consent decrees create the "material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties" necessary to permit an award of attorney's fees. 489 U. S., at 792-793; see also &lt;i&gt;Hanrahan, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 757 ("[I]t seems clearly to have been the intent of Congress to permit . . . an interlocutory award only to a party who has established his entitlement to some relief on the merits of his claims, either in the &lt;i&gt;trial court&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;on appeal&lt;/i&gt; " (emphasis added)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*605&lt;/span&gt; We think, however, the "catalyst theory" falls on the other side of the line from these examples. It allows an award where there is no judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties. Even under a limited form of the "catalyst theory," a plaintiff could recover attorney's fees if it established that the "complaint had sufficient merit to withstand a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction or failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted." Brief for United States as &lt;i&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 27. This is not the type of legal merit that our prior decisions, based upon plain language and congressional intent, have found necessary. Indeed, we held in &lt;i&gt;Hewitt&lt;/i&gt; that an interlocutory ruling that reverses a dismissal for failure to state a claim "is not the stuff of which legal victories are made." 482 U. S., at 760. See also &lt;i&gt;Hanrahan, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 754 (reversal of a directed verdict for defendant does not make plaintiff a "prevailing party"). A defendant's voluntary change in conduct, although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit, lacks the necessary judicial &lt;i&gt;imprimatur&lt;/i&gt; on the change. Our precedents thus counsel against holding that the term "prevailing party" authorizes an award of attorney's fees &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; a corresponding alteration in the legal relationship of the parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dissenters chide us for upsetting "long-prevailing &lt;i&gt;Circuit&lt;/i&gt; precedent." &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 622 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.) (emphasis added). But, as Justice Scalia points out in his concurrence, several Courts of Appeals have relied upon dicta in our prior cases in approving the "catalyst theory." See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 621-622; see also &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 603, n. 5. Now that the issue is squarely presented, it behooves us to reconcile the plain language of the statutes with our prior &lt;i&gt;holdings.&lt;/i&gt;  We have only awarded attorney's fees where the plaintiff has received a judgment on the merits, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Farrar, supra,&lt;/i&gt;  at 112, or obtained a court-ordered consent decree, &lt;i&gt;Maher, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 129-130&#151;we have not awarded attorney's fees where the plaintiff has secured the reversal of a directed &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*606&lt;/span&gt; verdict, see &lt;i&gt;Hanrahan,&lt;/i&gt; 446 U. S., at 759, or acquired a judicial pronouncement that the defendant has violated the Constitution unaccompanied by "&lt;i&gt;judicial&lt;/i&gt; relief," &lt;i&gt;Hewitt, supra,&lt;/i&gt;  at 760 (emphasis added). Never have we awarded attorney's fees for a nonjudicial "alteration of actual circumstances." &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 633 (dissenting opinion). While urging an expansion of our precedents on this front, the dissenters would simultaneously abrogate the "merit" requirement of our prior cases and award attorney's fees where the plaintiff's claim "was at least colorable" and "not . . . groundless." &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 627 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We cannot agree that the term "prevailing party" authorizes federal courts to award attorney's fees to a plaintiff who, by simply filing a nonfrivolous but nonetheless potentially meritless lawsuit (it will never be determined), has reached the "sought-after destination" without obtaining any judicial relief. &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 634 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*607&lt;/span&gt; Petitioners nonetheless argue that the legislative history of the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act supports a broad reading of "prevailing party" which includes the "catalyst theory." We doubt that legislative history could overcome what we think is the rather clear meaning of "prevailing party"&#151;the term actually used in the statute. Since we resorted to such history in &lt;i&gt;Garland,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S., at 790, &lt;i&gt;Maher,&lt;/i&gt; 448 U. S., at 129, and &lt;i&gt;Hanrahan, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 756&#151; 757, however, we do likewise here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House Report to &#167; 1988 states that "[t]he phrase `prevailing party' is not intended to be limited to the victor only after entry of a final judgment following a full trial on the merits," H. R. Rep. No. 94-1558, p. 7 (1976), while the Senate Report explains that "parties may be considered to have prevailed when they vindicate rights through a consent judgment or without formally obtaining relief," S. Rep. No. 94&#151; 1011, p. 5 (1976). Petitioners argue that these Reports and their reference to a 1970 decision from the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, &lt;i&gt;Parham&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 433 F. 2d 421 (1970), indicate Congress' intent to adopt the "catalyst theory."&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; We think the legislative history &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*608&lt;/span&gt; cited by petitioners is at best ambiguous as to the availability of the "catalyst theory" for awarding attorney's fees. Particularly in view of the "American Rule" that attorney's fees will not be awarded absent "explicit statutory authority," such legislative history is clearly insufficient to alter the accepted meaning of the statutory term. &lt;i&gt;Key Tronic,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S., at 819; see also &lt;i&gt;Hanrahan, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 758 ("[O]nly when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims . . . has there been a determination of the `substantial rights of the parties,' which Congress determined was a necessary foundation for departing from the usual rule in this country that each party is to bear the expense of his own attorney" (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 94-1558, at 8)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners finally assert that the "catalyst theory" is necessary to prevent defendants from unilaterally mooting an action before judgment in an effort to avoid an award of attorney's fees. They also claim that the rejection of the "catalyst theory" will deter plaintiffs with meritorious but expensive cases from bringing suit. We are skeptical of these assertions, which are entirely speculative and unsupported by any empirical evidence (&lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; whether the number of suits brought in the Fourth Circuit has declined, in relation to other Circuits, since the decision in &lt;i&gt;S-1 and S-2&lt;/i&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners discount the disincentive that the "catalyst theory" may have upon a defendant's decision to voluntarily change its conduct, conduct that may not be illegal. "The defendants' potential liability for fees in this kind of litigation can be as significant as, and sometimes even more significant than, their potential liability on the merits," &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jeff D.,&lt;/i&gt; 475 U. S. 717, 734 (1986), and the possibility of being assessed attorney's fees may well deter a defendant from altering its conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And petitioners' fear of mischievous defendants only materializes in claims for equitable relief, for so long as the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*609&lt;/span&gt; plaintiff has a cause of action for damages, a defendant's change in conduct will not moot the case.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; Even then, it is not clear how often courts will find a case mooted: "It is well settled that a defendant's voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice" unless it is "absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur." &lt;i&gt;Friends of Earth, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 528 U. S. 167, 189 (2000) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). If a case is not found to be moot, and the plaintiff later procures an enforceable judgment, the court may of course award attorney's fees. Given this possibility, a defendant has a strong incentive to enter a settlement agreement, where it can negotiate attorney's fees and costs. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Marek&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Chesny,&lt;/i&gt; 473 U. S., at 7 ("[M]any a defendant would be unwilling to make a binding settlement offer on terms that left it exposed to liability for attorney's fees in whatever amount the court might fix on motion of the plaintiff" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also stated that "[a] request for attorney's fees should not result in a second major litigation," &lt;i&gt;Hensley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Eckerhart,&lt;/i&gt; 461 U. S. 424, 437 (1983), and have accordingly avoided an interpretation of the fee-shifting statutes that would have "spawn[ed] a second litigation of significant dimension," &lt;i&gt;Garland, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 791. Among other things, a "catalyst theory" hearing would require analysis of the defendant's subjective motivations in changing its conduct, an analysis that "will likely depend on a highly factbound inquiry and may turn on reasonable inferences from the nature and timing of the defendant's change in conduct." &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*610&lt;/span&gt; Brief for United States as &lt;i&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 28. Although we do not doubt the ability of district courts to perform the nuanced "three thresholds" test required by the "catalyst theory"&#151;whether the claim was colorable rather than groundless; whether the lawsuit was a substantial rather than an insubstantial cause of the defendant's change in conduct; whether the defendant's change in conduct was motivated by the plaintiff's threat of victory rather than threat of expense, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 627-628 (dissenting opinion)&#151; it is clearly not a formula for "ready administrability." &lt;i&gt;Burlington&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dague,&lt;/i&gt; 505 U. S. 557, 566 (1992).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the clear meaning of "prevailing party" in the feeshifting statutes, we need not determine which way these various policy arguments cut. In &lt;i&gt;Alyeska,&lt;/i&gt; 421 U. S., at 260, we said that Congress had not "extended any roving authority to the Judiciary to allow counsel fees as costs or otherwise whenever the courts might deem them warranted." To disregard the clear legislative language and the holdings of our prior cases on the basis of such policy arguments would be a similar assumption of a "roving authority." For the reasons stated above, we hold that the "catalyst theory" is not a permissible basis for the award of attorney's fees under the FHAA, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 3613(c)(2), and ADA, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12205.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The judgment of the Court of Appeals is &lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;  Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I join the opinion of the Court in its entirety, and write to respond at greater length to the contentions of the dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Prevailing party" is not some newfangled legal term invented for use in late-20th-century fee-shifting statutes. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*611&lt;/span&gt; "[B]y the long established practice and universally recognized rule of the common law, in actions at law, the prevailing party is entitled to recover a judgment for costs . . . ." &lt;i&gt;Mansfield, C. &amp;amp; L. M. R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Swan,&lt;/i&gt; 111 U. S. 379, 387 (1884).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Costs have usually been allowed to the prevailing party, as incident to the judgment, since the statute 6 Edw. I, c. 1, &#167; 2, and the same rule was acknowledged in the courts of the States, at the time the judicial system of the United States was organized. . . . "Weighed in the light of these several provisions in the Judiciary Act [of 1789], the conclusion appears to be clear that Congress intended to allow costs to the prevailing party, as incident to the judgment . . . ." &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Baltimore,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;377&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 388, 390 (1869).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term has been found within the United States Statutes at Large since at least the Bankruptcy Act of 1867, which provided that "[t]he party prevailing in the suit shall be entitled to costs against the adverse party." Act of Mar. 2, 1867, ch. 176, &#167; 24, 14 Stat. 528. See also Act of Mar. 3, 1887, ch. 359, &#167; 15, 24 Stat. 508 ("If the Government of the United States shall put in issue the right of the plaintiff to recover the court may, in its discretion, allow costs to the prevailing party from the time of joining such issue"). A computer search shows that the term "prevailing party" appears at least 70 times in the current United States Code; it is no stranger to the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1988 was enacted, I know of no case, state or federal, in which&#151;either under a statutory invocation of "prevailing party" or under the common-law rule&#151;the "catalyst theory" was enunciated as the basis for awarding costs. Indeed, the dissent cites only one case in which (although the "catalyst theory" was not expressed) &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*612&lt;/span&gt; costs were awarded for a reason that the catalyst theory would support, but today's holding of the Court would not: &lt;i&gt;Baldwin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chesapeake &amp;amp; Potomac Tel. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;156&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Md.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;552&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 557, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;144&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;A.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;703&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 705 (1929), where costs were awarded because "the granting of [appellee's] motion to dismiss the appeal has made it unnecessary to inquire into the merits of the suit, and the dismissal is based on an act of appellee performed after both the institution of the suit and the entry of the appeal." And that case is irrelevant to the meaning of "prevailing party," because it was a case &lt;i&gt;in equity.&lt;/i&gt; While, as &lt;i&gt;Mansfield&lt;/i&gt; observed, costs were awarded in actions &lt;i&gt;at law&lt;/i&gt; to the "prevailing party," see 111 U. S., at 387, an equity court could award costs "as the equities of the case might require," &lt;i&gt;Getz&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Johnston,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;145&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Md.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;426&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 433, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;125&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;A.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;689&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 691 (1924). See also &lt;i&gt;Horn&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bohn,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;96&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Md.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 12-13, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;A.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;576&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 577 (1902) ("The question of costs in equity cases is a matter resting in the sound discretion of the Court, from the exercise of which no appeal will lie" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The other state or state-law cases the dissent &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*613&lt;/span&gt; cites as awarding costs despite the absence of a judgment all involve a judicial finding&#151;or its equivalent, an acknowledgment by the defendant&#151;of the merits of plaintiff's case.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Moreover, the dissent cites &lt;i&gt;not a single case&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*614&lt;/span&gt; which this Court&#151;or even any other federal court applying federal law prior to enactment of the fee-shifting statutes at issue here&#151;has regarded as the "prevailing party" a litigant who left the courthouse emptyhanded. If the term means what the dissent contends, that is a remarkable absence of authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That a judicial finding of liability was an understood requirement of "prevailing" is confirmed by many statutes that use the phrase in a context that &lt;i&gt;presumes&lt;/i&gt; the existence of a judicial ruling. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 5 U. S. C. &#167; 1221(g)(2) ("[i]f an employee . . . is the prevailing party . . . and the decision is based on a finding of a prohibited personnel practice"); &#167; 1221(g)(3) (providing for an award of attorney's fees to the "prevailing party," "regardless of the basis of the decision"); &#167; 7701(b)(2)(A) (allowing the prevailing party to obtain an interlocutory award of the "relief provided in the decision"); 8 U. S. C. &#167; 1324b(h) (permitting the administrative law judge to award an attorney's fee to the prevailing party "if the losing party's argument is without reasonable foundation in law and fact"); 18 U. S. C. &#167; 1864(e) (1994 ed., Supp. V) (allowing the district court to award the prevailing party its attorney's fee "in addition to monetary damages").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dissent points out, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 629, that the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 limits attorney's fees to an amount "proportionately related to the court ordered relief for the violation." This shows that &lt;i&gt;sometimes&lt;/i&gt; Congress &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt;  explicitly "tightly bind fees to judgments," &lt;i&gt;ibid.,&lt;/i&gt; inviting (the dissent believes) the conclusion that "prevailing party" does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; fasten fees to judgments. That conclusion does not follow from the premise. What this statutory provision demonstrates, &lt;i&gt;at most,&lt;/i&gt; is that use of the phrase "prevailing party" is not the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; way to impose a requirement of courtordered relief. That is assuredly true. But it would be no &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*615&lt;/span&gt; more rational to reject the normal meaning of "prevailing party" because some statutes produce the same result with different language, than it would be to conclude that, since there are many synonyms for the word "jump," the word "jump" must mean something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is undoubtedly true, as the dissent points out by quoting a nonlegal dictionary, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 633-634, that the word "prevailing" can have other meanings in other contexts: "prevailing winds" are the winds that predominate, and the "prevailing party" in an election is the party that wins the election. But when "prevailing party" is used by courts or legislatures in the context of a lawsuit, it is a term of art. It has traditionally&#151;and to my knowledge, prior to enactment of the first of the statutes at issue here, &lt;i&gt;invariably&lt;/i&gt; &#151; meant the party that wins the suit or obtains a finding (or an admission) of liability. Not the party that ultimately gets his way because his adversary dies before the suit comes to judgment; not the party that gets his way because circumstances so change that a victory on the legal point for the other side turns out to be a practical victory for him; and not the party that gets his way because the other side ceases (for whatever reason) its offensive conduct. If a nuisance suit is mooted because the defendant asphalt plant has gone bankrupt and ceased operations, one would not normally call the plaintiff the prevailing party. And it would make no difference, as far as the propriety of that characterization is concerned, if the plant did not go bankrupt but moved to a new location to avoid the expense of litigation. In one sense the plaintiff would have "prevailed"; but he would not be the prevailing party in the lawsuit. Words that have acquired a specialized meaning in the legal context must be accorded their &lt;i&gt;legal&lt;/i&gt; meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[W]here Congress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*616&lt;/span&gt; the body of learning from which it was taken and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial mind unless otherwise instructed. In such case, absence of contrary direction may be taken as satisfaction with widely accepted definitions, not as a departure from them." &lt;i&gt;Morissette&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases cited by the dissent in which we have "not treated Black's Law Dictionary as preclusively definitive," &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 628-629, are in apposite. In both &lt;i&gt;Pioneer Investment Services Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Brunswick Associates Ltd. Partnership,&lt;/i&gt; 507 U. S. 380 (1993), and &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rodgers,&lt;/i&gt; 466 U. S. 475 (1984), we rejected Black's definition because it conflicted with our precedent. See &lt;i&gt;Pioneer, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 395-396, n. 14; &lt;i&gt;Rodgers, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 480. We did not, as the dissent would do here, simply reject a relevant definition of a word tailored to judicial settings in favor of a more general definition from another dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dissent distorts the term "prevailing party" beyond its normal meaning for policy reasons, but even those seem to me misguided. They rest upon the presumption that the catalyst theory applies when "&lt;i&gt;the suit's merit&lt;/i&gt; led the defendant to abandon the fray, to switch rather than fight on, to accord plaintiff sooner rather than later the principal redress sought in the complaint," &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 622 (emphasis added). As the dissent would have it, by giving the term its normal meaning the Court today approves the practice of denying attorney's fees to a plaintiff with a proven claim of discrimination, simply because the very &lt;i&gt;merit&lt;/i&gt; of his claim led the defendant to capitulate before judgment. That is not the case. To the contrary, the Court &lt;i&gt;approves&lt;/i&gt; the result in &lt;i&gt;Parham&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Southwestern Bell Tel. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 433 F. 2d 421 (CA8 1970), where attorney's fees were awarded "after [a] finding that the defendant had acted unlawfully," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 607&#151; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*617&lt;/span&gt; 608, and n. 9.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; What the dissent's stretching of the term produces is something more, and something far less reasonable: an award of attorney's fees when the merits of the plaintiff's case remain unresolved&#151;when, for all one knows, the defendant only "abandon[ed] the fray" because the cost of litigation&#151;either financial or in terms of public relations&#151; would be too great. In such a case, the plaintiff may have "prevailed" as Webster's defines that term&#151;"gain[ed] victory by virtue of strength or superiority," see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 633. But I doubt it was greater strength in financial resources, or superiority in media manipulation, rather than &lt;i&gt;superiority in legal merit,&lt;/i&gt; that Congress intended to reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*618&lt;/span&gt; It could be argued, perhaps, that insofar as abstract justice is concerned, there is little to choose between the dissent's outcome and the Court's: If the former sometimes rewards the plaintiff with a phony claim (there is no way of knowing), the latter sometimes denies fees to the plaintiff with a solid case whose adversary slinks away on the eve of judgment. But it seems to me the evil of the former far outweighs the evil of the latter. There is all the difference in the world between a rule that denies the extraordinary boon of attorney's fees to some plaintiffs who are no less "deserving" of them than others who receive them, and a rule that causes the law to be the very instrument of wrong&#151;exacting the payment of attorney's fees to the extortionist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that monetary settlements and consent decrees can be extorted as well, and we have approved the award of attorney's fees in cases resolved through such mechanisms. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 604 (citing cases). Our decision that the statute makes plaintiff a "prevailing party" under such circumstances was based entirely on language in a House Report, see &lt;i&gt;Maher&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gagne,&lt;/i&gt; 448 U. S. 122, 129 (1980), and if this issue were to arise for the first time today, I doubt whether I would agree with that result. See &lt;i&gt;Hewitt&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Helms,&lt;/i&gt; 482 U. S. 755, 760 (1987) (Scalia, J.) (opining that "[r]espect for ordinary language requires that a plaintiff receive at least some relief &lt;i&gt;on the merits&lt;/i&gt; of his claim before he can be said to prevail" (emphasis added)). But in the case of courtapproved settlements and consent decrees, even if there has been no judicial determination of the merits, the outcome is at least the product of, and bears the sanction of, judicial action &lt;i&gt;in the lawsuit.&lt;/i&gt; There is at least &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; basis for saying that the party favored by the settlement or decree prevailed &lt;i&gt;in the suit.&lt;/i&gt; Extending the holding of &lt;i&gt;Maher&lt;/i&gt; to a case in which no judicial action whatever has been taken stretches the term "prevailing party" (and the potential injustice that &lt;i&gt;Maher&lt;/i&gt; produces) beyond what the normal meaning &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*619&lt;/span&gt; of that term in the litigation context can conceivably support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dissent points out that petitioners' object in bringing their suit was not to obtain "a judge's approbation," but to "stop enforcement of a [West Virginia] rule," &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 634; see also &lt;i&gt;Hewitt, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 761. True enough. But not even the dissent claims that if a petitioner accumulated attorney's fees in preparing a threatened complaint, but &lt;i&gt;never filed it&lt;/i&gt; prior to the defendant's voluntary cessation of its offending behavior, the wannabe-but-never-was plaintiff could recover fees; that would be countertextual, since the fee-shifting statutes require that there be an "action" or "proceeding," see 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 3613(d), 1988(b) (1994 ed., Supp. V)&#151;which in legal parlance (though not in more general usage) means &lt;i&gt;a lawsuit.&lt;/i&gt; See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 643 (concluding that a party should be deemed prevailing as a result of a "&lt;i&gt;postcomplaint&lt;/i&gt; payment or change in conduct" (emphasis added)). Does that not leave achievement of the broad congressional purpose identified by the dissent just as unsatisfactorily incomplete as the failure to award fees when there is no decree? Just as the dissent rhetorically asks &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; (never mind the language of the statute) Congress would want to award fees when there is a judgment, but deny fees when the defendant capitulates on the eve of judgment; so also it is fair for us to ask &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; Congress would want to award fees when suit has been filed, but deny fees when the about-to-be defendant capitulates under the threat of filing. Surely, it cannot be because determination of whether suit was actually contemplated and threatened is too difficult. All the proof takes is a threatening letter and a batch of timesheets. Surely &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;  obstacle would not deter the Congress that (according to the dissent) was willing to let district judges pursue that much more evasive will-o'-the-wisp called "catalyst." (Is this not why we &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; district courts?, asks the dissent, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 639&#151; 640.) My point is not that it would take no more twisting &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*620&lt;/span&gt; of language to produce prelitigation attorney's fees than to produce the decreeless attorney's fees that the dissent favors (though that may well be true). My point is that the departure from normal usage that the dissent favors cannot be justified on the ground that it establishes a regime of logical evenhandedness. There &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be a cutoff of seemingly equivalent entitlements to fees&#151;either the failure to file suit in time or the failure to obtain a judgment in time. The term "prevailing party" suggests the latter rather than the former. One does not prevail in a suit that is never determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dissent's ultimate worry is that today's opinion will "impede access to court for the less well-heeled," &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 623. But, of course, the catalyst theory also harms the "less wellheeled," putting pressure on them to avoid the risk of massive fees by abandoning a solidly defensible case early in litigation. Since the fee-shifting statutes at issue here allow defendants as well as plaintiffs to receive a fee award, we know that Congress did not intend to &lt;i&gt;maximize&lt;/i&gt; the quantity of "the enforcement of federal law by private attorneys general," &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Rather, Congress desired an &lt;i&gt;appropriate&lt;/i&gt;  level of enforcement&#151;which is more likely to be produced by limiting fee awards to plaintiffs who prevail "on the merits," or at least to those who achieve an enforceable "alteration of the legal relationship of the parties," than by permitting the open-ended inquiry approved by the dissent.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*621&lt;/span&gt; III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dissent points out that the catalyst theory has been accepted by "the clear majority of Federal Circuits," &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt;  But our disagreeing with a "clear majority" of the Circuits is not at all a rare phenomenon. Indeed, our opinions sometimes contradict the &lt;i&gt;unanimous&lt;/i&gt; and longstanding interpretation of lower federal courts. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;McNally&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 483 U. S. 350, 365 (1987) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (the Court's decision contradicted "[e]very court to consider" the question).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dissent's insistence that we defer to the "clear majority" of Circuit opinion is particularly peculiar in the present case, since that majority has been nurtured and preserved &lt;i&gt;by our own misleading dicta&lt;/i&gt; (to which I, unfortunately, contributed). Most of the Court of Appeals cases cited by the dissent, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 627, and n. 5, as reaffirming the catalyst theory after our decision in &lt;i&gt;Farrar&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hobby,&lt;/i&gt; 506 U. S. 103 (1992), relied on our earlier opinion in &lt;i&gt;Hewitt.&lt;/i&gt; See &lt;i&gt;Marbley&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Bane,&lt;/i&gt; 57 F. 3d 224, 234 (CA2 1995) (relying on &lt;i&gt;Hewitt&lt;/i&gt; to support catalyst theory); &lt;i&gt;Payne&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Board of Ed.,&lt;/i&gt; 88 F. 3d 392, 397 (CA6 1996) (same); &lt;i&gt;Baumgartner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Harrisburg Housing Auth.,&lt;/i&gt; 21 F. 3d 541, 548 (CA3 1994) (explicitly rejecting &lt;i&gt;Farrar&lt;/i&gt; infavor of &lt;i&gt;Hewitt&lt;/i&gt; ); &lt;i&gt;Zinn&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Shalala,&lt;/i&gt; 35 F. 3d 273, 274-276 (CA7 1994) (same); &lt;i&gt;Beard&lt;/i&gt; v.&lt;i&gt;Teska,&lt;/i&gt; 31 F. 3d 942, 950-952 (CA10 1994) (same); &lt;i&gt;Morris&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;West Palm Beach,&lt;/i&gt;  194 F. 3d 1203, 1207 (CA11 1999) (same). Deferring to our colleagues' own error is bad enough; but enshrining the error that we ourselves have improvidently suggested and blaming it on the near-unanimous judgment of our colleagues would surely be unworthy.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; Informing the Courts of Appeals &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*622&lt;/span&gt; that our ill-considered dicta have misled them displays, it seems to me, not "disrespect," but a most becoming (and well-deserved) humility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court today concludes that a party cannot be deemed to have prevailed, for purposes of fee-shifting statutes such as 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 1988, 3613(c)(2) (1994 ed. and Supp. V), unless there has been an enforceable "alteration of the legal relationship of the parties." That is the normal meaning of "prevailing party" in litigation, and there is no proper basis for departing from that normal meaning. Congress is free, of course, to revise these provisions&#151;but it is my guess that if it does so it will not create the sort of inequity that the catalyst theory invites, but will require the court to determine that there was at least a substantial likelihood that the party requesting fees would have prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court today holds that a plaintiff whose suit prompts the precise relief she seeks does not "prevail," and hence cannot obtain an award of attorney's fees, unless she also secures a court entry memorializing her victory. The entry need not be a judgment on the merits. Nor need there be any finding of wrongdoing. A court-approved settlement will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court's insistence that there be a document filed in court&#151;a litigated judgment or court-endorsed settlement&#151; upsets long-prevailing Circuit precedent applicable to scores of federal fee-shifting statutes. The decision allows a defendant to escape a statutory obligation to pay a plaintiff's counsel fees, even though the suit's merit led the defendant to abandon the fray, to switch rather than fight on, to accord plaintiff sooner rather than later the principal redress sought in the complaint. Concomitantly, the Court's constricted &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*623&lt;/span&gt; definition of "prevailing party," and consequent rejection of the "catalyst theory," impede access to court for the less well heeled, and shrink the incentive Congress created for the enforcement of federal law by private attorneys general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my view, the "catalyst rule," as applied by the clear majority of Federal Circuits, is a key component of the feeshifting statutes Congress adopted to advance enforcement of civil rights. Nothing in history, precedent, or plain English warrants the anemic construction of the term "prevailing party" the Court today imposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. (Buckhannon), operates residential care homes for elderly persons who need assisted living, but not nursing services. Among Buckhannon's residents in October 1996 was 102-year-old Dorsey Pierce. Pierce had resided at Buckhannon for some four years. Her daughter lived nearby, and the care provided at Buckhannon met Pierce's needs. Until 1998, West Virginia had a "self-preservation" rule prohibiting homes like Buckhannon from accommodating persons unable to exit the premises without assistance in the event of a fire. Pierce and two other Buckhannon residents could not get to a fire exit without aid. Informed of these residents' limitations, West Virginia officials proceeded against Buckhannon for noncompliance with the self-preservation rule. On October 18, 1996, three orders issued, each commanding Buckhannon to "cease operating . . . and to effect relocation of [its] existing population within thirty (30) days." App. 46-53.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten days later, Buckhannon and Pierce, together with an organization of residential homes and another Buckhannon resident (hereinafter plaintiffs), commenced litigation in Federal District Court to overturn the cease-and-desist orders and the self-preservation rule on which they rested. They sued the State, state agencies, and 18 officials (hereinafter defendants) alleging that the rule discriminated &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*624&lt;/span&gt; against persons with disabilities in violation of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA), 42 U. S. C. &#167; 3601 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12101 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; Plaintiffs sought an immediate order stopping defendants from closing Buckhannon's facilities, injunctive relief permanently barring enforcement of the self-preservation requirement, damages, and attorney's fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 1, 1996, at a hearing on plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order, defendants agreed to the entry of an interim order allowing Buckhannon to remain open without changing the individual plaintiffs' housing and care. Discovery followed. On January 2, 1998, facing the state defendants' sovereign immunity pleas, plaintiffs stipulated to dismissal of their demands for damages. In February 1998, in response to defendants' motion to dispose of the remainder of the case summarily, the District Court determined that plaintiffs had presented triable claims under the FHAA and ADA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than a month after the District Court found that plaintiffs were entitled to a trial, the West Virginia Legislature repealed the self-preservation rule. Plaintiffs still allege, and seek to prove, that their suit triggered the statutory repeal. After the rule's demise, defendants moved to dismiss the case as moot, and plaintiffs sought attorney's fees as "prevailing parties" under the FHAA, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 3613(c)(2), and the ADA, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12205.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*625&lt;/span&gt; Finding no likelihood that West Virginia would reenact the self-preservation rule, the District Court agreed that the State's action had rendered the case moot. Turning to plaintiffs' application for attorney's fees, the District Court followed Fourth Circuit precedent requiring the denial of fees unless termination of the action was accompanied by a judgment, consent decree, or settlement.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Plaintiffs did not appeal the mootness determination, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed the denial of attorney's fees. In sum, plaintiffs were denied fees not because they failed to achieve the relief they sought. On the contrary, they gained the very change they sought through their lawsuit when West Virginia repealed the self-preservation rule that would have stopped Buckhannon from caring for people like Dorsey Pierce.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to 1994, every Federal Court of Appeals (except the Federal Circuit, which had not addressed the issue) concluded that plaintiffs in situations like Buckhannon's and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*626&lt;/span&gt; Pierce's could obtain a fee award if their suit acted as a "catalyst" for the change they sought, even if they did not obtain a judgment or consent decree.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; The Courts of Appeals found it "clear that a party may be considered to have prevailed even when the legal action stops short of final . . . judgment due to . . . intervening mootness." &lt;i&gt;Grano&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Barry,&lt;/i&gt; 783 F. 2d 1104, 1108 (CADC 1986). Interpreting the term "prevailing party" in "a practical sense," &lt;i&gt;Stewart&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hannon,&lt;/i&gt; 675 F. 2d 846, 851 (CA7 1982) (citation omitted), federal courts across the country held that a party "prevails" for fee-shifting purposes when "its ends are accomplished as a result of the litigation," &lt;i&gt;Associated Builders &amp;amp; Contractors&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Orleans Parish School Bd.,&lt;/i&gt; 919 F. 2d 374, 378 (CA5 1990) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1994, the Fourth Circuit en banc, dividing 6-to-5, broke ranks with its sister courts. The court declared that, in light of &lt;i&gt;Farrar&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hobby,&lt;/i&gt; 506 U. S. 103 (1992), a plaintiff could &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*627&lt;/span&gt; not become a "prevailing party" without "an enforceable judgment, consent decree, or settlement." &lt;i&gt;S-1 and S-2&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State Bd. of Ed. of N. C.,&lt;/i&gt; 21 F. 3d 49, 51 (1994). As the Court today acknowledges, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 603, n. 5, and as we have previously observed, the language on which the Fourth Circuit relied was dictum: &lt;i&gt;Farrar&lt;/i&gt; "involved no catalytic effect"; the issue plainly "was not presented for this Court's decision in &lt;i&gt;Farrar.&lt;/i&gt; " &lt;i&gt;Friends of Earth, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 528 U. S. 167, 194 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Fourth Circuit's en banc ruling, nine Courts of Appeals reaffirmed their own consistently held interpretation of the term "prevail."&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; On this predominant view, "[s]ecuring an enforceable decree or agreement may evidence prevailing party status, but the judgment or agreement simply embodies and enforces what is sought in bringing the lawsuit . . . . Victory can be achieved well short of a final judgment (or its equivalent) . . . . " &lt;i&gt;Marbley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bane,&lt;/i&gt; 57 F. 3d 224, 234 (CA2 1995) (Jacobs, J.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The array of federal-court decisions applying the catalyst rule suggested three conditions necessary to a party's qualification as "prevailing" short of a favorable final judgment or consent decree. A plaintiff first had to show that the defendant provided "some of the benefit sought" by the lawsuit. &lt;i&gt;Wheeler&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Towanda Area School Dist.&lt;/i&gt; , 950 F. 2d 128, 131 (CA3 1991). Under most Circuits' precedents, a plaintiff had to demonstrate as well that the suit stated a genuine claim, &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; one that was at least "colorable," not "frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless." &lt;i&gt;Grano,&lt;/i&gt; 783 F. 2d, at 1110 (internal &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*628&lt;/span&gt; quotation marks and citation omitted). Plaintiff finally had to establish that her suit was a "substantial" or "significant" cause of defendant's action providing relief. &lt;i&gt;Williams&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Leatherbury,&lt;/i&gt; 672 F. 2d 549, 551 (CA5 1982). In some Circuits, to make this causation showing, plaintiff had to satisfy the trial court that the suit achieved results "by threat of victory," not "by dint of nuisance and threat of expense." &lt;i&gt;Marbley,&lt;/i&gt; 57 F. 3d, at 234-235; see also &lt;i&gt;Hooper&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Demco,&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 37 F. 3d 287, 293 (CA7 1994) (to render plaintiff "prevailing party," suit "must have prompted the defendant . . . to act or cease its behavior based on the strength of the case, not `wholly gratuitously' "). One who crossed these three thresholds would be recognized as a "prevailing party" to whom the district court, "in its discretion," &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 624&#151; 625, n. 1, could award attorney's fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed over decades and in legions of federal-court decisions, the catalyst rule and these implementing standards deserve this Court's respect and approbation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court today detects a "clear meaning" of the term prevailing party, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 610, that has heretofore eluded the large majority of courts construing those words. "Prevailing party," today's opinion announces, means "one who has been awarded some relief by the court," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 603. The Court derives this "clear meaning" principally from Black's Law Dictionary, which defines a "prevailing party," in critical part, as one "in whose favor a judgment is rendered," &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1145 (7th ed. 1999)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can entirely agree with Black's Law Dictionary that a party "in whose favor a judgment is rendered" prevails, and at the same time resist, as most Courts of Appeals have, any implication that &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; such a party may prevail. In prior cases, we have not treated Black's Law Dictionary as preclusively &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*629&lt;/span&gt; definitive; instead, we have accorded statutory terms, including legal "term[s] of art," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 603 (opinion of the Court); &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 616 (Scalia, J., concurring), a contextual reading. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pioneer Investment Services Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Brunswick Associates Ltd. Partnership,&lt;/i&gt; 507 U. S. 380, 395&#151; 396, n. 14 (1993) (defining "excusable neglect," as used in Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9006(b)(1), more broadly than Black's defines that term); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rodgers,&lt;/i&gt; 466 U. S. 475, 479-480 (1984) (adopting "natural, nontechnical" definition of word "jurisdiction," as that term is used in 18 U. S. C. &#167; 1001, and declining to confine definition to "narrower, more technical meanings," citing Black's). Notably, this Court did not refer to Black's Law Dictionary in &lt;i&gt;Maher&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gagne,&lt;/i&gt; 448 U. S. 122 (1980), which held that a consent decree could qualify a plaintiff as "prevailing." The Court explained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The fact that [plaintiff] prevailed through a settlement rather than through litigation does not weaken her claim to fees. Nothing in the language of [42 U. S. C.] &#167; 1988 conditions the District Court's power to award fees on full litigation of the issues or on a judicial determination that the plaintiff's rights have been violated." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 129.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spare "prevailing party" language of the fee-shifting provision applicable in &lt;i&gt;Maher,&lt;/i&gt; and the similar wording of the fee-shifting provisions now before the Court, contrast with prescriptions that so tightly bind fees to judgments as to exclude the application of a catalyst concept. The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, for example, directs that fee awards to prisoners under &#167; 1988 be "proportionately related to the &lt;i&gt;court ordered relief&lt;/i&gt; for the violation." 110 Stat. 1321-72, as amended, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1997e(d)(1)(B)(i) (1994 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added). That statute, by its express terms, forecloses an award to a prisoner on a catalyst theory. But the FHAA and ADA fee-shifting prescriptions, modeled &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*630&lt;/span&gt; on 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1988 unmodified, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 624-625, n. 1, do not similarly staple fee awards to "court ordered relief." Their very terms do not foreclose a catalyst theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is altogether true, as the concurring opinion points out, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 610-611, that litigation costs other than attorney's fees traditionally have been allowed to the "prevailing party," and that a judgment winner ordinarily fits that description. It is not true, however, that precedent on costs calls for the judgment requirement the Court ironly adopts today for attorney's fees. Indeed, the first decision cited in the concurring opinion, &lt;i&gt;Mansfield, C. &amp;amp; L. M. R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Swan,&lt;/i&gt;  111 U. S. 379 (1884), see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 611, tugs against the restrictive rule today's decision installs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Mansfield,&lt;/i&gt; plaintiffs commenced a contract action in state court. Over plaintiffs' objections, defendants successfully removed the suit to federal court. Plaintiffs prevailed on the merits there, and defendants obtained review here. See 111 U. S., at 380-381. This Court determined, on its own motion, that federal subject-matter jurisdiction was absent from the start. Based on that determination, the Court reversed the lower court's judgment for plaintiffs. Worse than entering and leaving this Courthouse equally "emptyhanded," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 614 (concurring opinion), the plaintiffs in &lt;i&gt;Mansfield&lt;/i&gt; were stripped of the judgment they had won, including the "judicial finding . . . of the merits" in their favor, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 613 (concurring opinion). The &lt;i&gt;Mansfield&lt;/i&gt; plaintiffs did, however, achieve this small consolation: The Court awarded them costs here as well as below. Recognizing that defendants had "prevail[ed]" in a "formal and nominal sense," the &lt;i&gt;Mansfield&lt;/i&gt; Court nonetheless concluded that "[i]n a true and proper sense" defendants were "the losing and not the prevailing party." 111 U. S., at 388.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;i&gt;Mansfield&lt;/i&gt; casts doubt on the present majority's "formal and nominal" approach, that decision does not consider &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*631&lt;/span&gt; whether costs would be in order for the plaintiff who obtains substantial relief, but no final judgment. Nor does "&lt;i&gt;a single case&lt;/i&gt; " on which the concurring opinion today relies, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 613 (emphasis in original).&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; There are, however, enlightening analogies. In multiple instances, state high courts have regarded plaintiffs as prevailing, for costs taxation purposes, when defendants' voluntary conduct, mooting the suit, provided the relief that plaintiffs sought.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; The concurring &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*632&lt;/span&gt; opinion labors unconvincingly to distinguish these state-law cases.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; A similar federal practice has been observed in cases governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d), the default rule allowing costs "to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs." See 10 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp;amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2667, pp. 187-188 (2d ed. 1983) (When "the defendant alters its conduct so that plaintiff's claim [for injunctive relief] becomes moot before judgment is reached, costs may be allowed [under Rule 54(d)] if the court finds that the changes &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*633&lt;/span&gt; were the result, at least in part, of plaintiff's litigation.") (citing, &lt;i&gt;inter alia, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Black Hills Alliance&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Regional Forester,&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/sdd/82ST/black-hills-alliance-etc-v-regional-forester/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;526&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;257&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (SD 1981)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, there is substantial support, both old and new, federal and state, for a costs award, "in [the court's] discretion," &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 625, n. 1, to the plaintiff whose suit prompts the defendant to provide the relief plaintiff seeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;C&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that no practice set in stone, statute, rule, or precedent, see &lt;i&gt;infra,&lt;/i&gt; at 643, dictates the proper construction of modern civil rights fee-shifting prescriptions, I would "assume . . . that Congress intends the words in its enactments to carry `their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.' " &lt;i&gt;Pioneer,&lt;/i&gt; 507 U. S., at 388 (defining "excusable neglect") (quoting &lt;i&gt;Perrin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979) (defining "bribery")); see also, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sutton&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United Air Lines, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 527 U. S. 471, 491 (1999) (defining "substantially" in light of ordinary usage); &lt;i&gt;Rutledge&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt;  517 U. S. 292, 299-300, n. 10 (1996) (similarly defining "in concert"). In everyday use, "prevail" means "gain victory by virtue of strength or superiority: win mastery: triumph." Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1797 (1976). There are undoubtedly situations in which an individual's goal is to obtain approval of a judge, and in those situations, one cannot "prevail" short of a judge's formal declaration. In a piano competition or a figure skating contest, for example, the person who prevails is the person declared winner by the judges. However, where the ultimate goal is not an arbiter's approval, but a favorable alteration of actual circumstances, a formal declaration is not essential. Western democracies, for instance, "prevailed" in the Cold War even though the Soviet Union never formally surrendered. Among television viewers, John F. Kennedy "prevailed" in the first debate with Richard M. Nixon during the 1960 Presidential contest, even though moderator Howard K. Smith &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*634&lt;/span&gt; never declared a winner. See T. White, The Making of the President 1960, pp. 293-294 (1961).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit's ultimate purpose is to achieve actual relief from an opponent. Favorable judgment may be instrumental in gaining that relief. Generally, however, "the judicial decree is not the end but the means. At the end of the rainbow lies not a judgment, but some action (or cessation of action) by the defendant . . . ." &lt;i&gt;Hewitt&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Helms,&lt;/i&gt;  482 U. S. 755, 761 (1987). On this common understanding, if a party reaches the "sought-after destination," then the party "prevails" regardless of the "route taken." &lt;i&gt;Hennigan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ouachita Parish School Bd.,&lt;/i&gt; 749 F. 2d 1148, 1153 (CA5 1985).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under a fair reading of the FHAA and ADA provisions in point, I would hold that a party "prevails" in "a true and proper sense," &lt;i&gt;Mansfield,&lt;/i&gt; 111 U. S., at 388, when she achieves, by instituting litigation, the practical relief sought in her complaint. The Court misreads Congress, as I see it, by insisting that, invariably, relief must be displayed in a judgment, and correspondingly that a defendant's voluntary action never suffices. In this case, Buckhannon's purpose in suing West Virginia officials was not narrowly to obtain a judge's approbation. The plaintiffs' objective was to stop enforcement of a rule requiring Buckhannon to evict residents like centenarian Dorsey Pierce as the price of remaining in business. If Buckhannon achieved that objective on account of the strength of its case, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 628&#151;if it succeeded in keeping its doors open while housing and caring for Ms. Pierce and others similarly situated&#151;then Buckhannon is properly judged a party who prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Courts of Appeals have long recognized, the catalyst rule suitably advances Congress' endeavor to place private actions, in civil rights and other legislatively defined areas, securely within the federal law enforcement arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*635&lt;/span&gt; The catalyst rule stemmed from modern legislation extending civil rights protections and enforcement measures. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 included provisions for fee awards to "prevailing parties" in Title II (public accommodations), 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000a&#151;3(b), and Title VII (employment), &#167; 2000e&#151;5(k), but not in Title VI (federal programs). The provisions' central purpose was"to promote vigorous enforcement" of the laws by private plaintiffs; although using the two-way term "prevailing party," Congress did not make fees available to plaintiffs and defendants on equal terms. &lt;i&gt;Christiansburg Garment Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;EEOC,&lt;/i&gt; 434 U. S. 412, 417, 421 (1978) (under Title VII, prevailing plaintiff qualifies for fee award absent "special circumstances," but prevailing defendant may obtain fee award only if plaintiff's suit is "frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the 1964 Act came into force, courts commenced to award fees regularly under the statutory authorizations, and sometimes without such authorization. See &lt;i&gt;Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wilderness Society,&lt;/i&gt; 421 U. S. 240, 262, 270-271, n. 46 (1975). In &lt;i&gt;Alyeska,&lt;/i&gt; this Court reaffirmed the "American Rule" that a court generally may not award attorney's fees without a legislative instruction to do so. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 269. To provide the authorization &lt;i&gt;Alyeska&lt;/i&gt; required for fee awards under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as well as under Reconstruction Era civil rights legislation, 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 1981-1983, 1985, 1986 (1994 ed. and Supp. V), and certain other enactments, Congress passed the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1988 (1994 ed. and Supp. V).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As explained in the Reports supporting &#167; 1988, civil rights statutes vindicate public policies "of the highest priority," S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 3 (1976) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Newman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 390 U. S. 400, 402 (1968) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; ), yet "depend heavily upon private enforcement," S. Rep. No. 94-1011, at 2. Persons who bring meritorious civil rights claims, in this light, serve as "private attorneys &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*636&lt;/span&gt; general." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 5; H. R. Rep. No. 94-1558, p. 2 (1976). Such suitors, Congress recognized, often "cannot afford legal counsel." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1. They therefore experience "severe hardshi[p]" under the "American Rule." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 2. Congress enacted &#167; 1988 to ensure that nonaffluent plaintiffs would have "effective access" to the Nation's courts to enforce civil rights laws. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; That objective accounts for the fee-shifting provisions before the Court in this case, prescriptions of the FHAA and the ADA modeled on &#167; 1988. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 624-625, n. 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the catalyst rule that held sway until today, plaintiffs who obtained the relief they sought through suit on genuine claims ordinarily qualified as "prevailing parties," so that courts had discretion to award them their costs and fees. Persons with limited resources were not impelled to "wage total law" in order to assure that their counsel fees would be paid. They could accept relief, in money or of another kind, voluntarily proffered by a defendant who sought to avoid a recorded decree. And they could rely on a judge then to determine, in her equitable discretion, whether counsel fees were warranted and, if so, in what amount.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*637&lt;/span&gt; Congress appears to have envisioned that very prospect. The Senate Report on the 1976 Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act states: "[F]or purposes of the award of counsel fees, parties may be considered to have prevailed when they vindicate rights through a consent judgment &lt;i&gt;or without formally obtaining relief.&lt;/i&gt; " S. Rep. No. 94-1011, at 5 (emphasis added). In support, the Report cites cases in which parties recovered fees in the absence of any court-conferred relief.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*638&lt;/span&gt; The House Report corroborates: "[A]fter a complaint is filed, a defendant might voluntarily cease the unlawful practice. &lt;i&gt;A court should still award fees&lt;/i&gt; even though it might conclude, as a matter of equity, that &lt;i&gt;no formal relief,&lt;/i&gt; such as an injunction, is needed." H. R. Rep. No. 94-1558, at 7 (emphases added). These Reports, Courts of Appeals have observed, are hardly ambiguous. Compare &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 607-608 ("legislative history . . . is at best ambiguous"), with, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dunn&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;The Florida Bar,&lt;/i&gt; 889 F. 2d 1010, 1013 (CA11 1989) (legislative history "evinces a clear Congressional intent" to permit award "even when no formal judicial relief is obtained" (internal quotation marks omitted)); &lt;i&gt;Robinson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kimbrough,&lt;/i&gt; 652 F. 2d 458, 465 (CA5 1981) (same); &lt;i&gt;American Constitutional Party&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Munro,&lt;/i&gt; 650 F. 2d 184, 187 (CA9 1981) (Senate Report "directs" fee award under catalyst rule). Congress, I am convinced, understood that "`[v]ictory' in a civil rights suit is typically a practical, rather than a strictly legal matter." &lt;i&gt;Exeter-West Greenwich Regional School Dist.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pontarelli,&lt;/i&gt; 788 F. 2d 47, 51 (CA1 1986) (citation omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court identifies several "policy arguments" that might warrant rejection of the catalyst rule. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 608-610. A defendant might refrain from altering its conduct, fearing liability for fees as the price of voluntary action. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt;  at 608. Moreover, rejection of the catalyst rule has limited impact: Desisting from the challenged conduct will not render a case moot where damages are sought, and even when the plaintiff seeks only equitable relief, a defendant's voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not render the case moot "unless it is `absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.' " &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 609 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Friends of Earth, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 528 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*639&lt;/span&gt; U. S., at 189). Because a mootness dismissal is not easily achieved, the defendant may be impelled to settle, negotiating fees less generous than a court might award. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt;  at 609. Finally, a catalyst rule would "require analysis of the defendant's subjective motivations," and thus protract the litigation. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court declines to look beneath the surface of these arguments, placing its reliance, instead, on a meaning of "prevailing party" that other jurists would scarcely recognize as plain. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 603. Had the Court inspected the "policy arguments" listed in its opinion, I doubt it would have found them impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In opposition to the argument that defendants will resist change in order to stave off an award of fees, one could urge that the catalyst rule may lead defendants promptly to comply with the law's requirements: the longer the litigation, the larger the fees. Indeed, one who knows noncompliance will be expensive might be encouraged to conform his conduct to the legal requirements before litigation is threatened. Cf. Hylton, Fee Shifting and Incentives to Comply with the Law, 46 Vand. L. Rev. 1069, 1121 (1993) ("fee shifting in favor of prevailing plaintiffs enhances both incentives to comply with legal rules &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; incentives to settle disputes"). No doubt, a mootness dismissal is unlikely when recurrence of the controversy is under the defendant's control. But, as earlier observed, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 636, why should this Court's feeshifting rulings drive a plaintiff prepared to accept adequate relief, though out-of-court and unrecorded, to litigate on and on? And if the catalyst rule leads defendants to negotiate not only settlement terms but also allied counsel fees, is that not a consummation to applaud, not deplore?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to the burden on the court, is it not the norm for the judge to whom the case has been assigned to resolve fee disputes (deciding whether an award is in order, and if it is, the amount due), thereby clearing the case from the calendar? If factfinding becomes necessary under the catalyst &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*640&lt;/span&gt; rule, is it not the sort that "the district courts, in their factfinding expertise, deal with on a regular basis"? &lt;i&gt;Baumgartner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Harrisburg Housing Auth.,&lt;/i&gt; 21 F. 3d 541, 548 (CA3 1994). Might not one conclude overall, as Courts of Appeals have suggested, that the catalyst rule "saves judicial resources," &lt;i&gt;Paris&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Department of Housing and Urban Development,&lt;/i&gt; 988 F. 2d 236, 240 (CA1 1993), by encouraging "plaintiffs to discontinue litigation after receiving through the defendant's acquiescence the remedy initially sought"? &lt;i&gt;Morris&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;West Palm Beach,&lt;/i&gt; 194 F. 3d 1203, 1207 (CA11 1999).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concurring opinion adds another argument against the catalyst rule: That opinion sees the rule as accommodating the "extortionist" who obtains relief because of "greater strength in financial resources, or superiority in media manipulation, rather than &lt;i&gt;superiority in legal merit.&lt;/i&gt; " &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt;  at 617, 618 (emphasis in original). This concern overlooks both the character of the rule and the judicial superintendence Congress ordered for all fee allowances. The catalyst rule was auxiliary to fee-shifting statutes whose primary purpose is "to promote the vigorous enforcement" of the civil rights laws. &lt;i&gt;Christiansburg Garment Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 434 U. S., at 422. To that end, courts deemed the conduct-altering catalyst that counted to be the substance of the case, not merely the plaintiff's atypically superior financial resources, media ties, or political clout. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 628. And Congress assigned responsibility for awarding fees not to automatons unable to recognize extortionists, but to judges expected and instructed to exercise "discretion." See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 624-625, n. 1. So viewed, the catalyst rule provided no berth for nuisance suits, see &lt;i&gt;Hooper,&lt;/i&gt; 37 F. 3d, at 292, or "thinly disguised forms of extortion," &lt;i&gt;Tyler&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Corner Constr. Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 167 F. 3d 1202, 1206 (CA8 1999) (citation omitted).&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*641&lt;/span&gt; V&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to our attorney's fee precedents, the Court correctly observes, "[w]e have never had occasion to decide whether the term `prevailing party' allows an award of fees under the `catalyst theory,' " and "there is language in our cases supporting both petitioners and respondents." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 603, n. 5. It bears emphasis, however, that in determining whether fee shifting is in order, the Court in the past has placed greatest weight not on any "judicial &lt;i&gt;imprimatur,&lt;/i&gt; " &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 605, but on the practical impact of the lawsuit.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Maher&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gagne,&lt;/i&gt; 448 U. S. 122 (1980), in which the Court held fees could be awarded on the basis of a consent decree, the opinion nowhere relied on the presence of a formal judgment. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 629; &lt;i&gt;infra,&lt;/i&gt; at 642-643, n. 14. Some years &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*642&lt;/span&gt; later, in &lt;i&gt;Hewitt&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Helms,&lt;/i&gt; 482 U. S. 755 (1987), the Court suggested that fees might be awarded the plaintiff who "obtain[ed] relief without [the] benefit of a formal judgment." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 760. The Court explained: "If the defendant, under the pressure of the lawsuit, pays over a money claim before the judicial judgment is pronounced," or "if the defendant, under pressure of [a suit for declaratory judgment], alters his conduct (or threatened conduct) towards the plaintiff," &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; conduct "that was the basis for the suit, the plaintiff will have prevailed." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 761. I agree, and would apply that analysis to this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court posits a "`merit' requirement of our prior cases." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 606. &lt;i&gt;Maher,&lt;/i&gt; however, affirmed an award of attorney's fees based on a consent decree that "did not purport to adjudicate [plaintiff's] statutory or constitutional claims." 448 U. S., at 126, n. 8. The decree in &lt;i&gt;Maher&lt;/i&gt; "explicitly stated that `nothing [therein was] intended to constitute an admission of fault by either party.' " &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; The catalyst rule, in short, conflicts with none of "our prior &lt;i&gt;holdings,&lt;/i&gt; " &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 605.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*643&lt;/span&gt; * * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court states that the term "prevailing party" in feeshifting statutes has an "accepted meaning." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 608. If that is so, the "accepted meaning" is not the one the Court today announces. It is, instead, the meaning accepted by every Court of Appeals to address the catalyst issue before our 1987 decision in &lt;i&gt;Hewitt,&lt;/i&gt; see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 626, n. 4, and disavowed since then only by the Fourth Circuit, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 627, n. 5. A plaintiff prevails, federal judges have overwhelmingly agreed, when a litigated judgment, consent decree, out-of-court settlement, or the defendant's voluntary, postcomplaint payment or change in conduct in fact affords redress for the plaintiff's substantial grievances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this Court rejects the considered judgment prevailing in the Circuits, respect for our colleagues demands a cogent &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*644&lt;/span&gt; explanation. Today's decision does not provide one. The Court's narrow construction of the words "prevailing party" is unsupported by precedent and unaided by history or logic. Congress prescribed fee-shifting provisions like those included in the FHAA and ADA to encourage private enforcement of laws designed to advance civil rights. Fidelity to that purpose calls for court-awarded fees when a private party's lawsuit, whether or not its settlement is registered in court, vindicates rights Congress sought to secure. I would so hold and therefore dissent from the judgment and opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1]  The original complaint also sought money damages, but petitioners relinquished this claim on January 2, 1998. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The District Court sanctioned respondents under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 for failing to timely provide notice of the legislative amendment. App. 147.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stanton&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Southern Berkshire Regional School Dist.,&lt;/i&gt; 197 F. 3d 574, 577, n. 2 (CA1 1999); &lt;i&gt;Marbley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bane,&lt;/i&gt; 57 F. 3d 224, 234 (CA2 1995); &lt;i&gt;Baumgartner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Harrisburg Housing Authority,&lt;/i&gt; 21 F. 3d 541, 546&#151; 550 (CA3 1994); &lt;i&gt;Payne&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Board of Ed.,&lt;/i&gt; 88 F. 3d 392, 397 (CA6 1996); &lt;i&gt;Zinn&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Shalala,&lt;/i&gt; 35 F. 3d 273, 276 (CA7 1994); &lt;i&gt;Little Rock School Dist.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pulaski Cty.

&lt;p&gt;[4]  We have interpreted these fee-shifting provisions consistently, see &lt;i&gt;Hensley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Eckerhart,&lt;/i&gt; 461 U. S. 424, 433, n. 7 (1983), and so approach the nearly identical provisions at issue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  We have never had occasion to decide whether the term "prevailing party" allows an award of fees under the "catalyst theory" described above. Dictum in &lt;i&gt;Hewitt&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Helms,&lt;/i&gt; 482 U. S. 755, 760 (1987), alluded to the possibility of attorney's fees where "voluntary action by the defendant . . .affords the plaintiff all or some of the relief . . .sought," but we expressly reserved the question, see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 763 ("We need not decide the circumstances, if any, under which this `catalyst' theory could justify a fee award"). And though the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit relied upon our decision in&lt;i&gt;Farrar&lt;/i&gt; v.&lt;i&gt;Hobby,&lt;/i&gt; 506 U. S. 103 (1992), in rejecting the "catalyst theory," &lt;i&gt;Farrar&lt;/i&gt; "involved no catalytic effect." &lt;i&gt;Friends of Earth, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 528 U. S. 167, 194 (2000). Thus, there is language in our cases supporting both petitioners and respondents, and last term we observed that it was an open question here. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  However, in some circumstances such a "prevailing party" should still not receive an award of attorney's fees. See &lt;i&gt;Farrar&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hobby, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 115-116.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  We have subsequently characterized the &lt;i&gt;Maher&lt;/i&gt; opinion as also allowing for an award of attorney's fees for private settlements. See &lt;i&gt;Farrar&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Hobby, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 111; &lt;i&gt;Hewitt&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Helms, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 760. But this dictum ignores that &lt;i&gt;Maher&lt;/i&gt; only "held that fees &lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt; be assessed . . . after a case has been settled by the entry of a consent decree." &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jeff D.,&lt;/i&gt; 475 U. S. 717, 720 (1986). Private settlements do not entailthe judicialapproval and oversight involved in consent decrees. And federal jurisdiction to enforce a private contractual settlement will often be lacking unless the terms of the agreement are incorporated into the order of dismissal. See &lt;i&gt;Kokkonen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S. 375 (1994).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  Although the dissenters seek support from &lt;i&gt;Mansfield, C. &amp;amp; L. M. R. Co.&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Swan,&lt;/i&gt; 111 U. S. 379 (1884), that case involved costs, not attorney's fees. "[B]y the long established practice and universally recognized rule of the common law . . . the prevailing party is entitled to recover a judgment for costs," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 387, but "the rule `has long been that attorney's fees are not ordinarily recoverable,' " &lt;i&gt;Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wilderness Society,&lt;/i&gt; 421 U. S. 240, 257 (1975) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Fleischmann Distilling Corp.&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Maier Brewing Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 386 U. S. 714, 717 (1967)). Courts generally, and this Court in particular, then and now, have a presumptive rule for costs which the Court in its discretion may vary. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; this Court's Rule 43.2 ("If the Court reverses or vacates a judgment, the respondent or appellee shall pay costs unless the Court otherwise orders"). In &lt;i&gt;Mansfield,&lt;/i&gt; the defendants had successfully removed the case to federal court, successfully opposed the plaintiffs' motion to remand the case to state court, lost on the merits of the case, and then reversed course and successfully argued in this Court that the lower federal court had no jurisdiction. The Court awarded costs to the plaintiffs, even though they had lost and the defendants won on the jurisdictional issue, which was the only question this Court decided. In no ordinary sense of the word can the plaintiffs have been said to be the prevailing party here&#151;they lost and their opponents won on the only litigated issue&#151;so the Court's use of the term must be regarded as a figurative rather than a literal one, justifying the departure from the presumptive rule allowing costs to the prevailing party because of the obvious equities favoring the plaintiffs. The Court employed its discretion to recognize that the plaintiffs had been the victims of the defendants' legally successful whips awing tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9]  Although the Court of Appeals in &lt;i&gt;Parham&lt;/i&gt; awarded attorney's fees to the plaintiff because his "lawsuit acted as a catalyst which prompted the [defendant] to take action . .. seeking compliance with the requirements of Title VII," 433 F. 2d,at 429-430, it did so only after finding that the defendant had acted unlawfully, see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 426 ("We hold as a matter of law that [plaintiff'sevidence] established a violation of Title VII"). Thus, consistent with our holding in &lt;i&gt;Farrar, Parham&lt;/i&gt; stands for the proposition that an enforceable judgment permits an award of attorney's fees. And like the consent decree in &lt;i&gt;Maher&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gagne,&lt;/i&gt; 448 U. S. 122 (1980), the Court of Appeals in &lt;i&gt;Parham&lt;/i&gt; ordered the District Court to "retain jurisdiction over the matter for a reasonable period of time to insure the continued implementation of the appellee'spolicy of equal employment opportunities." 433 F. 2d, at 429. Clearly &lt;i&gt;Parham&lt;/i&gt; does not support a theory of fee shifting untethered to a material alteration in the legal relationship of the parties as defined by our precedents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[10]  Only States and state officers acting in their official capacity are immune from suits for damages in federal court. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Edelman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jordan,&lt;/i&gt; 415 U. S. 651 (1974). Plaintiffs may bring suit for damages against all others, including municipalities and other political subdivisions of a State, see &lt;i&gt;Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Doyle,&lt;/i&gt; 429 U. S. 274 (1977).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The jurisdiction that issued &lt;i&gt;Baldwin&lt;/i&gt; has used the phrase "prevailing party" frequently (including in equity cases) to mean the party acquiring a judgment. See &lt;i&gt;Getz&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Johnston,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;145&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Md.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;426&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 434, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;125&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;A.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;689&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 691-692 (1924) (an equity decision noting that "on reversal, following the usual rule, the costs will generally go to the prevailing party, that is, to the appellant" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). See also, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hoffman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Glock,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/mdctspecapp/b7s6/hoffman-v-glock/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Md. App.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;284&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 293, 315 A. 2d 551, 557 (1974) ("Md. Rule 604a provides: `Unless otherwise provided by law, or ordered by the court, the prevailing party shall be entitled to the allowance of court costs, which shall be taxed by the clerk and embraced in the judgment' "); &lt;i&gt;Fritts&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fritts,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/mdctspecapp/dga5/fritts-v-fritts/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Md. App.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;195&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 197, 273 A. 2d 648, 649 (1971) ("We have viewed the evidence, as we must, in a light most favorable to appellee as the prevailing party below"); &lt;i&gt;Chillum-Adelphi Volunteer Fire Dept., Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Button &amp;amp; Goode, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;242&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Md.

Ct. App., Dec. 1829) ("[T]he demurrer being set down to be argued, the court proceeds to affirm or reverse the decree, and the prevailing party takes the deposite").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Our decision to award costs in &lt;i&gt;Mansfield, C. &amp;amp; L. M. R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Swan,&lt;/i&gt;  111 U. S. 379 (1884), does not "tu[g] against the restrictive rule today's decision installs," &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 630 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Defendants had removed the case to federal court, and after losing on the merits, sought to have us vacate the judgment because the basis for removal (diversity of citizenship) was absent. We concluded that because defendants were responsible for the improper removal in the first place, our judgment's "effect [was] to defeat the entire proceeding which they originated and have prosecuted," 111 U. S., at 388. In other words, plaintiffs "prevailed" because defendants' original position as to jurisdiction was defeated. In &lt;i&gt;Ficklen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Danville,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;146&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Va.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;426&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 438-439, 132 S. E. 705, 706 (1926), appellants were deemed to have "`substantially prevail[ed]' " on their appeal because appellees "abandoned their contention made before the lower court," &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; "abandoned their intention and desire to rely upon the correctness of the trial court's decree." In &lt;i&gt;Talmage&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Monroe,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;119&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;P.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;526&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Cal. App. 1911), costs were awarded after the defendant complied with an alternative writ of mandamus; it was the writ, not the mere petition, which led to defendant's action.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scatcherd&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Love,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;166&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CA6 1908), &lt;i&gt;Wagner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wagner,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Pa.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;214&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1848), and other cases cited by the dissent represent a rule adopted in some States that by settling a defendant "acknowledged his liability," &lt;i&gt;Scatcherd, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 56; see also &lt;i&gt;Wagner, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 215. That rule was hardly uniform among the States. Compare 15 C. J., Costs &#167; 167, p. 89 (1918) (citing cases from 13 States which hold that a "settlement is equivalent to a confession of judgment"), with &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 89-90, &#167; 168, and n. a (citing cases from 11 States which hold that under a settlement "plaintiff cannot recover costs," because "[c]osts . . . can only follow a judgment or final determination of the action" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). I do not think these state cases (and &lt;i&gt;Scatcherd,&lt;/i&gt; a federal case applying state law) justify expanding the federal meaning of "prevailing party" (based on a "confession of judgment" fiction) to include the party accepting an out-of-court settlement&#151;much less to expand it beyond settlements, to the domain of the "catalyst theory."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only case cited by the dissent in which the conclusion of acknowledgment of liability was rested on something other than a settlement is &lt;i&gt;Board of Ed. of Madison Cty.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fowler,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;192&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 14 S. E. 2d 478 (1941), which, in one of the States that considered settlement an acknowledgment of liability, analogized compliance with what had been sought by a mandamus suit to a settlement. This is a slim reed upon which to rest the broad conclusion of a catalyst theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  The dissent incorrectly characterizes &lt;i&gt;Parham&lt;/i&gt; as involving undifferentiated "findings or retention of jurisdiction," &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 637, n. 11. In fact, &lt;i&gt;Parham&lt;/i&gt; involved a finding that the defendant &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; discriminated, and jurisdiction was retained so that that finding could be given effect, in the form of injunctive relief, should the defendant ever backslide in its voluntary provision of relief to plaintiffs. Jurisdiction was not retained to determine whether there had been discrimination, and I do not read the Court's opinion as suggesting a fee award would be appropriate in &lt;i&gt;those&lt;/i&gt;  circumstances.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dissent notes that two other cases were cited in Senate legislative history (&lt;i&gt;Parham&lt;/i&gt; is cited in legislative history from both the Senate and House) which it claims support the catalyst theory. If legislative history in general is a risky interpretive tool, legislative history from only one legislative chamber&#151;and consisting of the citation of Court of Appeals cases that surely few if any Members of Congress read&#151;is virtually worthless. In any event, &lt;i&gt;Kopet&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Esquire Realty Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 523 F. 2d 1005 (CA2 1975), does not support the catalyst theory because the defendant's voluntary compliance was not at issue. Fees were awarded on the dubious premise that discovery uncovered some documents of potential use in other litigation, making this more a case of an award of interim fees. &lt;i&gt;Thomas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Honey brook Mines,&lt;/i&gt; 428 F. 2d 981 (CA3 1970), is also in apposite. There, the question was whether counsel for union members, whose fruitless efforts to sue the union had nonetheless spurred the union to sue the employer, should be paid out of a fund established by the union's victory. Whether the union members were "prevailing parties" in the union suit, or whether they were entitled to attorney's fees as "prevailing parties" in the earlier suit against the union, was not even at issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Even the legislative history relied upon by the dissent supports the conclusion that some merit is necessary to justify a fee award. See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt;  at 636, n. 9 (citing a House Report for the proposition that fee-shifting statutes are "`designed to give &lt;i&gt;[`victims of civil rights violation']&lt;/i&gt; access to the judicial process' " (emphasis added)); &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; (citing a Senate Report: "`[I]f those &lt;i&gt;who violate the Nation's fundamental laws&lt;/i&gt; are not to proceed with impunity,' " fee awards are necessary (emphasis added)). And for the reasons given by the Court, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 605, the catalyst theory's purported "merit test"&#151;the ability to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, or the absence of frivolousness&#151;is scant protection for the innocent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  That a few cases adopting the catalyst theory predate &lt;i&gt;Hewitt&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Helms,&lt;/i&gt;  482 U. S. 755 (1987), see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 625-626, and n.4, is irrelevant to my point. Absent our dicta in &lt;i&gt;Hewitt,&lt;/i&gt; and in light of everything else we have said on this topic, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 603-604, it is unlikely that the catalyst theory would have achieved that universality of acceptance by the Courts of Appeals upon which the dissent relies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The FHAA provides: "In a civil action . . . , the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney's fee and costs." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 3613(c)(2). Similarly, the ADA provides: "In any action . . . , the court . . . , in itsdiscretion, may allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney's fee, including litigation expenses, and costs .. .." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12205. These ADA and FHAA provisions are modeled on other "prevailing party" statutes, notably the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1988 (1994 ed. and Supp. V). See H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, p. 140 (1991) (ADA); H. R. Rep. No. 100-711, pp. 16-17, n. 20 (1988) (FHAA). Section 1988 was "patterned upon the attorney's fees provisions contained in Titles II and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 2000a&#151;3(b) and 2000e&#151;5(k), and &#167; 402 of the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1975, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1973&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt; (e)." &lt;i&gt;Hensley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Eckerhart,&lt;/i&gt; 461 U. S. 424, 433, n. 7 (1983) (citing &lt;i&gt;Hanrahan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hampton,&lt;/i&gt;  446 U. S. 754, 758, n. 4 (1980) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; ). In accord with congressional intent, we have interpreted these fee-shifting provisions consistently across statutes. The Court so observes. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 603, n. 4. Notably, the statutes do not mandate fees, but provide for their award "in [the court's] discretion."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  On plaintiffs' motion, the District Court sanctioned defendants under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 for failing timely to notify plaintiffs "that the proposed [repeal of the self-preservation rule] was progressing successfully at several stages . . . during the pendency of [the] litigation." App. 144. In their Rule 11 motion, plaintiffs requested fees and costs totaling $62,459 to cover the expense of litigating after defendants became aware, but did not disclose, that elimination of the rule was likely. In the alternative, plaintiffs sought $3,252 to offset fees and expenses incurred in litigating the Rule 11 motion. The District Court, stating that "the primary purpose of Rule 11 is to deter and not to compensate," awarded the smaller sum. App. 147.&lt;/p&gt;

But cf. &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 621, and n. 5 (Scalia, J., concurring) (maintaining that this Court's decision in &lt;i&gt;Hewitt&lt;/i&gt; "improvidently suggested" the catalyst rule, and asserting that only "a few cases adopting the catalyst theory predate &lt;i&gt;Hewitt&lt;/i&gt; "). &lt;i&gt;Hewitt&lt;/i&gt; said it was "settled law" that when a lawsuit prompts a defendant's "voluntary action . . . that redresses the plaintiff's grievances," the plaintiff "is deemed to have prevailed despite the absence of a formal judgment in his favor." 482 U. S., at 760-761. That statement accurately conveyed the unanimous view then held by the Federal Circuits.&lt;/p&gt;

In &lt;i&gt;The Baltimore,&lt;/i&gt; there was a judgment in one party's favor. See 8 Wall., at 384. The Court did not address the question whether costs are available absent such a judgment. &lt;i&gt;The Baltimore&lt;/i&gt; `s "incident to the judgment" language, which the concurrence emphasizes, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 611 (citing 8 Wall., at 388, 390), likely related to the once-maintained rule that a court without jurisdiction may not award costs. See &lt;i&gt;Mayor&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cooper,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/s8K/mayor-v-cooper/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wall.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;247&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 250-251 (1868). That ancient rule figured some years later in &lt;i&gt;Mansfield, C. &amp;amp; L. M. R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Swan,&lt;/i&gt; 111 U. S. 379 (1884); the Court noted the "universally recognized rule of the common law" that, absent jurisdiction, a "court can render no judgment for or against either party, [and therefore] cannot render a judgment even for costs." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 387. Receding from that rule, the Court awarded costs, even upon dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, because "there is a judgment or final order in the cause dismissing it for want of jurisdiction." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.;&lt;/i&gt; see &lt;i&gt;U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bonner Mall Partnership,&lt;/i&gt; 513 U. S. 18, 21 (1994).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Board of Ed. of Madison Cty.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fowler,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;192&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ga.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 36, 14 S. E. 2d 478, 479 (1941) (mandamus action dismissed as moot, but costs awarded to plaintiffs where "the purposes of the mandamus petition were accomplished by the subsequent acts of the defendants, thus obviating the necessity for further proceeding"); &lt;i&gt;Baldwin&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chesapeake &amp;amp; Potomac Tel. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;156&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Md.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;552&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 557, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;144&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;A.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;703&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 705 (1929) (costs awarded to plaintiff after trial court granted defendant's demurrer and plaintiff's appeal was dismissed "based on an act of [defendant] performed after . . . entry of the appeal"; dismissal rendered "it unnecessary to inquire into the merits of the suit"); &lt;i&gt;Ficklen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Danville,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;146&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Va.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;426&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 438, 132 S. E. 705, 706 (1926) (costs on appeal awarded to plaintiffs, even though trial court denied injunctive relief and high court dismissed appeal due to mootness, because plaintiffs achieved the "equivalent to . . . `substantially prevailing' " in "gain[ing] all they sought by the appeal"); cf. &lt;i&gt;Scatcherd&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Love,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;166&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 55, 56 (CA6 1908) (although "there was no judgment against the defendant upon the merits," defendant "acknowledged its liability . . . by paying to the plaintiff the sum of $5,000," rendering plaintiff the "successful party" entitled to costs); &lt;i&gt;Talmage&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Monroe,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;119&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;P.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;526&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Cal. App. 1911) (fees awarded to petitioner after court issued "alternative writ" directing respondent either to take specified action or to show cause for not doing so, and respondent chose to take the action).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  The concurrence urges that &lt;i&gt;Baldwin&lt;/i&gt; is inapposite because it was an action &lt;i&gt;"in equity,"&lt;/i&gt; and equity courts could award costs as the equities required. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 612 (emphasis in original). The catalyst rule becomes relevant, however, only when a party seeks relief of a sort traditionally typed &lt;i&gt;equitable, i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; a change of conduct, not damages. There is no such thing as an injunction &lt;i&gt;at law,&lt;/i&gt; and therefore one cannot expect to find long-ago plaintiffs who quested after that mythical remedy and received voluntary relief. By the concurrence's reasoning, the paucity of precedent applying the catalyst rule to "prevailing parties" is an artifact of nothing more "remarkable," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 614, than the historic law-equity separation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concurrence notes that the other cited cases "all involve a judicial finding&#151;&lt;i&gt;or its equivalent, an acknowledgment by the defendant&lt;/i&gt; &#151;of the merits of plaintiff's case." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 613 (emphasis added). I agree. In &lt;i&gt;Fowler&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Scatcherd,&lt;/i&gt; however, the "acknowledgment" consisted of nothing more than the defendant's voluntary provision to the plaintiff of the relief that the plaintiff sought. See also, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jeffersonville R. R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Weinman,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;39&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Ind.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;231&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1872) (costs awarded where defendant voluntarily paid damages; no admission or merits judgment); &lt;i&gt;Wagner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wagner,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Pa.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;214&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1848) (same); &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Johnson,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Va.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1791) (same). Commonlaw courts thus regarded a defendant's voluntary compliance, by settlement or otherwise, as an "acknowledgment . . . of the merits" sufficient to warrant treatment of a plaintiff as prevailing. But cf. &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 604, n. 7 (opinion of the Court). One can only wonder why the concurring opinion would not follow the same practice today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9]  See H. R. Rep. No. 94-1558, at 1 ("Because a vast majority of the victims of civil rights violations cannot afford legal counsel, they are unable to present their cases to the courts. . . . [This statute] is designed to give such persons effective access to the judicial process . . . ."); S. Rep. No. 94-1011, at 2 ("If private citizens are to be able to assert their civil rights, and if those who violate the Nation's fundamental laws are not to proceed with impunity, then citizens must have the opportunity to recover what it costs them to vindicate these rights in court."), quoted in part in &lt;i&gt;Kay&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ehrler,&lt;/i&gt; 499 U. S. 432, 436, n. 8 (1991). See also &lt;i&gt;Newman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 390 U. S. 400, 401-402 (1968) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; ("When the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, it was evident that enforcement would prove difficult and that the Nation would have to rely in part upon private litigation as a means of securing broad compliance with the law. . . . [Congress] enacted the provision for counsel fees . . . to encourage individuals injured by racial discrimination to seek judicial relief . . . .").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[10]  Given the protection furnished by the catalyst rule, aggrieved individuals were not left to worry, and wrongdoers were not led to believe, that strategic maneuvers by defendants might succeed in averting a fee award. Cf. &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 608 (opinion of the Court). Apt here is Judge Friendly's observation construing a fee-shifting statute kin to the provisions before us: "Congress clearly did not mean that where [a Freedom of Information Act] suit had gone to trial and developments made it apparent that the judge was about to rule for the plaintiff, the Government could abort any award of attorney fees by an eleventh hour tender of the information." &lt;i&gt;Vermont Low Income Advocacy Council&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Usery,&lt;/i&gt; 546 F. 2d 509, 513 (CA2 1976) (interpreting 5 U. S. C. &#167; 552(a)(4)(E), allowing a complainant who "substantially prevails" to earn an attorney's fee); accord, &lt;i&gt;Cuneo&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rumsfeld,&lt;/i&gt;  553 F. 2d 1360, 1364 (CADC 1977).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[11]  See S. Rep. No. 94-1011, at 5 (citing &lt;i&gt;Kopet&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Esquire Realty Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 523 F. 2d 1005, 1008-1009 (CA2 1975) (partner sued his firm for release of documents, firm released the documents, court awarded fees because of the release, even though the partner's claims were "dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction"), and &lt;i&gt;Thomas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Honeybrook Mines, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 428 F. 2d 981, 984, 985 (CA3 1970) (union committee twice commenced suit for pension fund payments, suits prompted recovery, and court awarded fees even though the first suit had been dismissed and the second had not yet been adjudicated)).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court features a case cited by the House as well as the Senate in the Reports on &#167; 1988, &lt;i&gt;Parham&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Southwestern Bell Tel. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 433 F. 2d 421 (CA8 1970). The Court deems &lt;i&gt;Parham&lt;/i&gt; consistent with its rejection of the catalyst rule, alternately because the Eighth Circuit made a "finding that the defendant had acted unlawfully," and because that court ordered the District Court to "`retain jurisdiction over the matter . . . to insure the continued implementation of the [defendant's] policy of equal employment opportunities.' " &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 607, n. 9 (quoting 433 F. 2d, at 429). Congress did not fix on those factors, however: Nothing in either Report suggests that judicial findings or retention of jurisdiction is essential to an award of fees. The courts in &lt;i&gt;Kopet&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Thomas&lt;/i&gt; awarded fees based on claims as to which they neither made "a finding" nor "retain[ed] jurisdiction." (It nonetheless bears attention that, in line with the Court's description of &lt;i&gt;Parham,&lt;/i&gt; a plaintiff could qualify as the "prevailing party" based on a finding or retention of jurisdiction.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[12]  The concurring opinion notes, correctly, that "[t]here &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be a cutoff of seemingly equivalent entitlements to fees&#151;either the failure to file suit in time or the failure to obtain a judgment in time." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 620 (emphasis in original). The former cutoff, the Court has held, is impelled both by "plain language" requiring a legal "action" or "proceeding" antecedent to a fee award, and by "legislative history . . . replete with references to [enforcement] `in suits,' `through the courts' and by `judicial process.' " &lt;i&gt;North Carolina Dept. of Transp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Crest Street Community Council, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt;  479 U. S. 6, 12 (1986) (citations omitted). The latter cutoff, requiring "a judgment in time," is not similarly impelled by text or legislative history.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concurring opinion also states that a prevailing party must obtain relief &lt;i&gt;"in the lawsuit." Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 615, 618. One can demur to that elaboration of the statutory text and still adhere to the catalyst rule. Under the rule, plaintiff's suit raising genuine issues must trigger defendant's voluntary action; plaintiff will not prevail under the rule if defendant "ceases . . . [his] offensive conduct" by dying or going bankrupt. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt;  at 615. A behavior-altering event like dying or bankruptcy occurs outside the lawsuit; a change precipitated by the lawsuit's claims and demand for relief is an occurrence brought about "through" or "in" the suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[13]  To qualify for fees in any case, we have held, relief must be real. See &lt;i&gt;Rhodes&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Stewart,&lt;/i&gt; 488 U. S. 1, 4 (1988) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; (a plaintiff who obtains a formal declaratory judgment, but gains no real "relief whatsoever," is not a "prevailing party" eligible for fees); &lt;i&gt;Hewitt&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Helms,&lt;/i&gt; 482 U. S., at 761 (an interlocutory decision reversing a dismissal for failure to state a claim, although stating that plaintiff's rights were violated, does not entitle plaintiff to fees; to "prevail," plaintiff must gain relief of "substance," &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; more than a favorable "judicial statement that does not affect the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[14]  The Court repeatedly quotes passages from &lt;i&gt;Hanrahan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hampton,&lt;/i&gt;  446 U. S., at 757-758, stating that to "prevail," plaintiffs must receive relief "on the merits." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 603, 604, 608. Nothing in &lt;i&gt;Hanrahan,&lt;/i&gt; however, declares that relief "on the merits" requires a "judicial &lt;i&gt;imprimatur.&lt;/i&gt; " &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 605. As the Court acknowledges, &lt;i&gt;Hanrahan&lt;/i&gt; concerned an interim award of fees, after plaintiff succeeded in obtaining nothing more than reversal of a directed verdict. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 605. At that juncture, plaintiff had obtained no change in defendant's behavior, and the suit's ultimate winner remained undetermined. There is simply no inconsistency between &lt;i&gt;Hanrahan,&lt;/i&gt; denying fees when a plaintiff might yet obtain no real benefit, and the catalyst rule, allowing fees when a plaintiff obtains the practical result she sought in suing. Indeed, the harmony between the catalyst rule and &lt;i&gt;Hanrahan&lt;/i&gt; is suggested by &lt;i&gt;Hanrahan&lt;/i&gt; itself; like &lt;i&gt;Maher&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Gagne,&lt;/i&gt; 448 U. S. 122, 129 (1980), &lt;i&gt;Hanrahan&lt;/i&gt; quoted the Senate Report recognizing that parties may prevail "through a consent judgment &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; without formally obtaining relief." 446 U. S., at 757 (quoting S. Rep. No. 94-1011, at 5) (emphasis added). &lt;i&gt;Hanrahan&lt;/i&gt; also selected for citation the influential elaboration of the catalyst rule in &lt;i&gt;Nadeau&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Helgemoe,&lt;/i&gt; 581 F. 2d, at 279-281. See 446 U. S., at 757.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court additionally cites &lt;i&gt;Texas State Teachers Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Garland Independent School Dist.,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 782 (1989), which held, unanimously, that a plaintiff could become a "prevailing party" without obtaining relief on the "central issue in the suit." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 790. &lt;i&gt;Texas State Teachers&lt;/i&gt; linked fee awards to a "material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 792-793, but did not say, as the Court does today, that the change must be "court-ordered," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 604. The parties' legal relationship does change when the defendant stops engaging in the conduct that furnishes the basis for plaintiff's civil action, and that action, which both parties would otherwise have litigated, is dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision with language most unfavorable to the catalyst rule, &lt;i&gt;Farrar&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hobby,&lt;/i&gt; 506 U. S. 103 (1992), does not figure prominently in the Court's opinion&#151;and for good reason, for &lt;i&gt;Farrar&lt;/i&gt; "involved no catalytic effect." See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 603, n. 5 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Friends of Earth, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 528 U. S. 167, 194 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted)); &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 627. &lt;i&gt;Farrar&lt;/i&gt; held that a plaintiff who sought damages of $17 million, but received damages of $1, was a "prevailing party" nonetheless not entitled to fees. 506 U. S., at 113-116. In reinforcing the link between the right to a fee award and the "degree of success obtained," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 114 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Hensley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Eckerhart,&lt;/i&gt; 461 U. S., at 436), &lt;i&gt;Farrar&lt;/i&gt; `s &lt;i&gt;holding&lt;/i&gt; is consistent with the catalyst rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Decided May 29, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*646&lt;/span&gt; Rehnquist, C. J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. Souter, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., joined, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 659.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Charles G. Cole&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Shannen W. Coffin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;William J. Darling.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Marcelino R. Gomez&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause and filed a brief for respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beth S. Brinkmann&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging affirmance. On the brief were &lt;i&gt;Acting Solicitor General Underwood, Acting Assistant&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*647&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Attorney General Cruden, Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler, Edward C. DuMont, E. Ann Peterson,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;William B. Lazarus.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 450 U. S. 544 (1981), we held that, with limited exceptions, Indian tribes lack civil authority over the conduct of nonmembers on non-Indian fee land within a reservation. The question with which we are presented is whether this general rule applies to tribal attempts to tax nonmember activity occurring on non-Indian fee land. We hold that it does and that neither of &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; `s exceptions obtains here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1916, Hubert Richardson, lured by the possibility of trading with wealthy Gray Mountain Navajo cattlemen, built the Cameron Trading Post just south of the Little Colorado River near Cameron, Arizona. G. Richardson, Navajo Trader 136-137 (1986). Richardson purchased the land &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*648&lt;/span&gt; directly from the United States, but the Navajo Nation Reservation, which had been established in 1868, see 15 Stat. 667, was later extended eight miles south so that the Cameron Trading Post fell within its exterior boundaries. See Act of June 14, 1934, ch. 521, 48 Stat. 960-962. This 1934 enlargement of the Navajo Reservation&#151;which today stretches across northeast Arizona, northwest New Mexico, and southeast Utah&#151;did not alter the status of the property: It is, like millions of acres throughout the United States, non-Indian fee land within a tribal reservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richardson's "drafty, wooden store building and four small, one-room-shack cabins overlooking the bare river canyon," Richardson, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 135, have since evolved into a business complex consisting of a hotel, restaurant, cafeteria, gallery, curio shop, retail store, and recreational vehicle facility. The current owner, petitioner Atkinson Trading Company, Inc., benefits from the Cameron Trading Post's location near the intersection of Arizona Highway 64 (which leads west to the Grand Canyon) and United States Highway 89 (which connects Flagstaff on the south with Glen Canyon Dam to the north). A significant portion of petitioner's hotel business stems from tourists on their way to or from the Grand Canyon National Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1992, the Navajo Nation enacted a hotel occupancy tax, which imposes an 8 percent tax upon any hotel room located within the exterior boundaries of the Navajo Nation Reservation. See 24 Navajo Nation Code &#167;&#167; 101-142 (1995), App. to Pet. for Cert. 102a&#151;124a. Although the legal incidence of the tax falls directly upon the guests, the owner or operator of the hotel must collect and remit it to respondents, members of the Navajo Tax Commission. &#167;&#167; 104, 107. The nonmember guests at the Cameron Trading Post pay approximately $84,000 in taxes to respondents annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner's challenge under &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; to the Navajo Nation's authority to impose the hotel occupancy tax was rejected by both the Navajo Tax Commission and the Navajo &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*649&lt;/span&gt; Supreme Court. Petitioner then sought relief in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, which also upheld the tax. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed. See 210 F. 3d 1247 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Court of Appeals agreed with petitioner that our cases in this area "did make an issue of the fee status of the land in question," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1256, it nonetheless concluded that the status of the land as "fee land or tribal land is simply one of the factors a court should consider" when determining whether civil jurisdiction exists, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1258 (citing 18 U. S. C. &#167; 1151). Relying in part upon our decision in &lt;i&gt;Merrion&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jicarilla Apache Tribe,&lt;/i&gt; 455 U. S. 130 (1982), the court "complement[ed]" &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; `s framework with a "case-by-case approach" that balanced the non-Indian fee status of the land with "the nature of the inherent sovereign powers the tribe is attempting to exercise, its interests, and the impact that the exercise of the tribe's powers has upon the nonmember interests involved." 210 F. 3d, at 1255, 1257, 1261. The Court of Appeals then likened the Navajo hotel occupancy tax to similar taxes imposed by New Mexico and Arizona, concluding that the tax fell under &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; `s first exception because a "consensual relationship exists in that the nonmember guests could refrain from the privilege of lodging within the confines of the Navajo Reservation and therefore remain free from liability for the [tax]." 210 F. 3d, at 1263 (citing &lt;i&gt;Buster&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wright,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;135&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;947&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 949 (CA8 1905)). The dissenting judge would have applied &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; without "any language or `factors' derived from &lt;i&gt;Merrion&lt;/i&gt; " and concluded that, based upon her view of the record, none of the &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; exceptions applied. 210 F. 3d, at 1269 (Briscoe, J., dissenting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We granted certiorari, 531 U. S. 1009 (2000), and now reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tribal jurisdiction is limited: For powers not expressly conferred upon them by federal statute or treaty, Indian tribes &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*650&lt;/span&gt; must rely upon their retained or inherent sovereignty. In &lt;i&gt;Montana,&lt;/i&gt; the most exhaustively reasoned of our modern cases addressing this latter authority, we observed that Indian tribe power over nonmembers on non-Indian fee land is sharply circumscribed. At issue in &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; was the Crow Tribe's attempt to regulate nonmember fishing and hunting on non-Indian fee land within the reservation. Although we "readily agree[d]" that the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty authorized the Crow Tribe to prohibit nonmembers from hunting or fishing on tribal land, 450 U. S., at 557, we held that such "power cannot apply to lands held in fee by non-Indians." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 559. This delineation of members and nonmembers, tribal land and non-Indian fee land, stemmed from the dependent nature of tribal sovereignty. Surveying our cases in this area dating back to 1810, see &lt;i&gt;Fletcher&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Peck,&lt;/i&gt; 6 Cranch 87, 147 (1810) (Johnson, J., concurring) (stating that Indian tribes have lost any "right of governing every person within their limits except themselves"), we noted that "through their original incorporation into the United States as well as through specific treaties and statutes, Indian tribes have lost many of the attributes of sovereignty." 450 U. S., at 563.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; We concluded that the inherent sovereignty of Indian tribes was limited to "their members and their territory": "[E]xercise of tribal power beyond what is necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*651&lt;/span&gt; is inconsistent with the dependent status of the tribes." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 564 (citing &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wheeler,&lt;/i&gt; 435 U. S. 313, 326 (1978) ("[T]he dependent status of Indian tribes . . . is necessarily inconsistent with their freedom to determine their external relations" (emphasis deleted))).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we extracted from our precedents "the general proposition that the inherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe," 450 U. S., at 565, we nonetheless noted in &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt;  two possible bases for tribal jurisdiction over non-Indian fee land. First, "[a] tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other means, the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members, through commercial dealings, contracts, leases, or other arrangements." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Second, "[a] tribe may . . . exercise civil authority over the conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 566. Applying these precepts, we found that the nonmembers at issue there had not subjected themselves to "tribal civil jurisdiction" through any agreements or dealings with the Tribe and that hunting and fishing on non-Indian fee land did not "imperil the subsistence or welfare of the Tribe." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt;  We therefore held that the Crow Tribe's regulations could not be enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The framework set forth in &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; "broadly addressed the concept of `inherent sovereignty.' " &lt;i&gt;Strate&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;A-1 Contractors,&lt;/i&gt; 520 U. S. 438, 453 (1997) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Montana, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 563). In &lt;i&gt;Strate,&lt;/i&gt; we dealt with the Three Affiliated Tribes' assertion of judicial jurisdiction over an automobile accident involving two nonmembers traveling on a state highway within the reservation. Although we did not question the ability of tribal police to patrol the highway, see 520 U. S., at 456, n. 11, we likened the public right-of-way to non-Indian fee land because the Tribes lacked the power to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*652&lt;/span&gt; "assert a landowner's right to occupy and exclude," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 456. Recognizing that &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; "immediately involved regulatory authority,"&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; we nonetheless concluded that its reasoning had "delineated&#151;in a main rule and exceptions&#151;the bounds of the power tribes retain to exercise `forms of civil jurisdiction over non-Indians.' " 520 U. S., at 453 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Montana, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 565). We accordingly held that &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; governed tribal assertions of adjudicatory authority over non-Indian fee land within a reservation. See 520 U. S., at 453 ("Subject to controlling provisions in treaties and statutes, and the two exceptions identified in &lt;i&gt;Montana,&lt;/i&gt;  the &lt;i&gt;civil authority&lt;/i&gt; of Indian tribes and their courts with respect to non-Indian fee lands generally `do[es] not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe' " (emphasis added) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Montana, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 565)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing our decision in &lt;i&gt;Merrion,&lt;/i&gt; respondents submit that &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Strate&lt;/i&gt; do not restrict an Indian tribe's power to impose revenue-raising taxes.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Merrion,&lt;/i&gt; just one year after our decision in &lt;i&gt;Montana,&lt;/i&gt; we upheld a severance tax imposed by the Jicarilla Apache Tribe upon non-Indian lessees authorized to extract oil and gas from tribal land. In so doing, we noted that the power to tax derives not solely from an Indian tribe's power to exclude non-Indians from tribal land, but also from an Indian tribe's "general authority, as sovereign, to control economic activity within its jurisdiction." 455 U. S., at 137. Such authority, we held, was incident to the benefits conferred upon nonmembers: "They benefit from the provision of police protection and other governmental services, as well as from ` "the advantages of a civilized society"` that are assured by the existence of tribal &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*653&lt;/span&gt; government." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 137-138 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Exxon Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Department of Revenue of Wis.,&lt;/i&gt; 447 U. S. 207, 228 (1980)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Merrion,&lt;/i&gt; however, was careful to note that an Indian tribe's inherent power to tax only extended to "`transactions occurring on &lt;i&gt;trust lands&lt;/i&gt; and significantly involving a tribe or its members.'" 455 U. S., at 137 (emphasis added) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Washington&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation,&lt;/i&gt;  447 U. S. 134, 152 (1980)). There are undoubtedly parts of the &lt;i&gt;Merrion&lt;/i&gt; opinion that suggest a broader scope for tribal taxing authority than the quoted language above.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; But &lt;i&gt;Merrion&lt;/i&gt; involved a tax that only applied to activity occurring on the reservation, and its holding is therefore easily reconcilable with the &lt;i&gt;Montana-Strate&lt;/i&gt; line of authority, which we deem to be controlling. See &lt;i&gt;Merrion, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 142 ("[A] tribe has no authority over a nonmember until the nonmember enters tribal lands or conducts business with the tribe"). An Indian tribe's sovereign power to tax&#151;whatever its derivation&#151;reaches no further than tribal land.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*654&lt;/span&gt; We therefore do not read &lt;i&gt;Merrion&lt;/i&gt; to exempt taxation from &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; `s general rule that Indian tribes lack civil authority over nonmembers on non-Indian fee land. Accordingly, as in &lt;i&gt;Strate,&lt;/i&gt; we apply &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; straight up. Because Congress has not authorized the Navajo Nation's hotel occupancy tax through treaty or statute, and because the incidence of the tax falls upon nonmembers on non-Indian fee land, it is incumbent upon the Navajo Nation to establish the existence of one of &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; `s exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondents argue that both petitioner and its hotel guests have entered into a consensual relationship with the Navajo Nation justifying the imposition of the hotel occupancy tax.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; Echoing the reasoning of the Court of Appeals, respondents note that the Cameron Trading Post benefits from the numerous services provided by the Navajo Nation. The record reflects that the Arizona State Police and the Navajo Tribal Police patrol the portions of United States &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*655&lt;/span&gt; Highway 89 and Arizona Highway 64 traversing the reservation; that the Navajo Tribal Police and the Navajo Tribal Emergency Medical Services Department will respond to an emergency call from the Cameron Trading Post; and that local Arizona Fire Departments and the Navajo Tribal Fire Department provide fire protection to the area.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; Although we do not question the Navajo Nation's ability to charge an appropriate fee for a particular service actually rendered,&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; we think the generalized availability of tribal services patently insufficient to sustain the Tribe's civil authority over nonmembers on non-Indian fee land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consensual relationship must stem from "commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements," &lt;i&gt;Montana,&lt;/i&gt;  450 U. S., at 565, and a nonmember's actual or potential receipt of tribal police, fire, and medical services does not create the requisite connection. If it did, the exception would swallow the rule: All non-Indian fee lands within a reservation benefit, to some extent, from the "advantages of a civilized society" offered by the Indian tribe. &lt;i&gt;Merrion, supra,&lt;/i&gt;  at 137-138 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Such a result does not square with our precedents; indeed, we implicitly rejected this argument in &lt;i&gt;Strate,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; where we held that the nonmembers had not consented to the Tribes' adjudicatory authority by availing themselves of the benefit of tribal police protection while traveling within the reservation. See 520 U. S., at 456-457, and n. 11. We therefore reject respondents' broad reading of &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; `s first exception, which ignores the dependent status of Indian tribes and subverts the territorial restriction upon tribal power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*656&lt;/span&gt; Respondents and their principal &lt;i&gt;amicus,&lt;/i&gt; the United States, also argue that petitioner consented to the tax by becoming an "Indian trader." Congress has authorized the Commissioner of Indian Affairs "to appoint traders to the Indian tribes and to make such rules and regulations as he may deem just and proper specifying the kind and quantity of goods and the prices at which such goods shall be sold to the Indians." 25 U. S. C. &#167; 261. Petitioner has acquired the requisite license to transact business with the Navajo Nation and therefore is subject to the regulatory strictures promulgated by the Indian Affairs Commissioner. See 25 CFR pt. 141 (2000).&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; But whether or not the Navajo Nation could impose a tax on activities arising out of this relationship, an issue not before us, it is clear that petitioner's "Indian trader" status by itself cannot support the imposition of the hotel occupancy tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt;`s consensual relationship exception requires that the tax or regulation imposed by the Indian tribe have a nexus to the consensual relationship itself. In &lt;i&gt;Strate,&lt;/i&gt; for example, even though respondent A-1 Contractors was on the reservation to perform landscaping work for the Three Affiliated Tribes at the time of the accident, we nonetheless held that the Tribes lacked adjudicatory authority because the other nonmember "was not a party to the subcontract, and the [T]ribes were strangers to the accident." 520 U. S., at 457 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A nonmember's consensual relationship in one area thus does not trigger tribal civil authority in another&#151;it is not "in for a penny, in for a Pound." E. Ravenscroft, The Canterbury Guests; Or A Bargain Broken, act v, sc. 1. The hotel occupancy tax at issue here is grounded in petitioner's relationship with its nonmember hotel guests, who can reach the Cameron Trading Post on United States Highway 89 and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*657&lt;/span&gt; Arizona Highway 64, non-Indian public rights-of-way. Petitioner cannot be said to have consented to such a tax by virtue of its status as an "Indian trader."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Court of Appeals did not reach &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; `s second exception, both respondents and the United States argue that the hotel occupancy tax is warranted in light of the direct effects the Cameron Trading Post has upon the Navajo Nation. Again noting the Navajo Nation's provision of tribal services and petitioner's status as an "Indian trader," respondents emphasize that petitioner employs almost 100 Navajo Indians; that the Cameron Trading Post derives business from tourists visiting the reservation; and that large amounts of tribal land surround petitioner's isolated property.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; Although we have no cause to doubt respondents' assertion that the Cameron Chapter of the Navajo Nation possesses an "overwhelming Indian character," Brief for Respondents 13-14, we fail to see how petitioner's operation of a hotel on non-Indian fee land "threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe." &lt;i&gt;Montana, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 566.&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*658&lt;/span&gt; We find unpersuasive respondents' attempt to augment this claim by reference to &lt;i&gt;Brendale&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation,&lt;/i&gt; 492 U. S. 408, 440 (1989) (opinion of Stevens, J.). In this portion of &lt;i&gt;Brendale,&lt;/i&gt; per the reasoning of two Justices, we held that the Yakima Nation had the authority to zone a small, non-Indian parcel located "in the heart" of over 800,000 acres of closed and largely uninhabited tribal land. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Respondents extrapolate from this holding that Indian tribes enjoy broad authority over nonmembers wherever the acreage of non-Indian fee land is minuscule in relation to the surrounding tribal land. But we think it plain that the judgment in &lt;i&gt;Brendale&lt;/i&gt; turned on both the closed nature of the non-Indian fee land&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt; and the fact that its development would place the entire area "in jeopardy." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 443 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; Irrespective of the percentage of non-Indian fee land within a reservation, &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; `s second exception grants Indian tribes nothing "`beyond what is necessary to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*659&lt;/span&gt; protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations.' " &lt;i&gt;Strate,&lt;/i&gt; 520 U. S., at 459 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Montana,&lt;/i&gt; 450 U. S., at 564). Whatever effect petitioner's operation of the Cameron Trading Post might have upon surrounding Navajo land, it does not endanger the Navajo Nation's political integrity. See &lt;i&gt;Brendale, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 431 (opinion of White, J.) (holding that the impact of the nonmember's conduct "must be demonstrably serious and must imperil the political integrity, the economic security, or the health and welfare of the tribe").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian tribes are "unique aggregations possessing attributes of sovereignty over both their members and their territory," but their dependent status generally precludes extension of tribal civil authority beyond these limits. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mazurie,&lt;/i&gt; 419 U. S. 544, 557 (1975). The Navajo Nation's imposition of a tax upon nonmembers on non-Indian fee land within the reservation is, therefore, presumptively invalid. Because respondents have failed to establish that the hotel occupancy tax is commensurately related to any consensual relationship with petitioner or is necessary to vindicate the Navajo Nation's political integrity, the presumption ripens into a holding. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is accordingly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Souter, with whom Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas join, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are to see coherence in the various manifestations of the general law of tribal jurisdiction over non-Indians, the source of doctrine must be &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 450 U. S. 544 (1981), and it is in light of that case that I join the Court's opinion. Under &lt;i&gt;Montana,&lt;/i&gt; the status of territory within a reservation's boundaries as tribal or fee land may have much to do (as it does here) with the likelihood (or not) that facts will exist that are relevant under the exceptions to &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; `s "general proposition" that "the inherent sovereign &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*660&lt;/span&gt; powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 565. That general proposition is, however, the first principle, regardless of whether the land at issue is fee land, or land owned by or held in trust for an Indian tribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   Briefs of &lt;i&gt;amici curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal were filed for the State of South Dakota et al. by &lt;i&gt;Mark W. Barnett,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General of South Dakota, and &lt;i&gt;John Patrick Guhin,&lt;/i&gt; Deputy Attorney General, and by the Attorneys General for their respective States as follows: &lt;i&gt;Bill Pryor&lt;/i&gt; of Alabama, &lt;i&gt;Ken Salazar&lt;/i&gt; of Colorado, &lt;i&gt;Robert A. Butterworth&lt;/i&gt; of Florida, &lt;i&gt;Jennifer M. Granholm&lt;/i&gt; of Michigan, &lt;i&gt;Mike Moore&lt;/i&gt; of Mississippi, &lt;i&gt;Wayne Stenehjem&lt;/i&gt; of North Dakota, &lt;i&gt;W. A.

Westesen;&lt;/i&gt; for Proper Economic Resource Management, Inc., by &lt;i&gt;Randy V. Thompson;&lt;/i&gt; and for Roberta Bugenig et al. by &lt;i&gt;James S. Burling.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefs of &lt;i&gt;amici curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging affirmance were filed for the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation et al. by &lt;i&gt;William R. Perry&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Arthur Lazarus, Jr.;&lt;/i&gt; for the Colorado River Indian Tribes et al. by &lt;i&gt;Susan M. Williams;&lt;/i&gt; for the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation et al. by &lt;i&gt;Michael L. Roy&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Jeffrey D. Lerner;&lt;/i&gt; and for the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux (Dakota) Community et al. by &lt;i&gt;Andrew M. Small&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Steven F. Olson.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  We also noted that nearly 90 million acres of non-Indian fee land had been acquired as part of the Indian General Allotment Act, 24 Stat. 388, as amended, 25 U. S. C. &#167; 331 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; which authorized the issuance of patents in fee to individual Indian allottees who, after holding the patent for 25 years, could then transfer the land to non-Indians. Although Congress repudiated the practice of allotment in the Indian Reorganization Act, 48 Stat. 984, 25 U. S. C. &#167; 461 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; we nonetheless found significant that Congress equated alienation "with the dissolution of tribal affairs and jurisdiction." &lt;i&gt;Montana,&lt;/i&gt; 450 U. S., at 559, n. 9. We thus concluded that it "defie[d] common sense to suppose that Congress would intend that non-Indians purchasing allotted lands would become subject to tribal jurisdiction." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  See also &lt;i&gt;South Dakota&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bourland,&lt;/i&gt; 508 U. S. 679 (1993); &lt;i&gt;Brendale&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation,&lt;/i&gt; 492 U. S. 408 (1989).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Respondents concede that regulatory taxes fall under the &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt;  framework. See 450 U. S., at 565 ("A tribe may regulate, through taxation, . . . the activities of nonmembers").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  &lt;i&gt;Merrion&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jicarilla Apache Tribe,&lt;/i&gt; 455 U. S. 130 (1982), for example, referenced the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in &lt;i&gt;Buster&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wright,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;135&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;947&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1905). But we have never endorsed &lt;i&gt;Buster&lt;/i&gt; `s statement that an Indian tribe's "jurisdiction to govern the inhabitants of a country is not conditioned or limited by the title to the land which they occupy in it." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 951. Accordingly, beyond any guidance it might provide as to the type of consensual relationship contemplated by the first exception of &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 450 U. S. 544, 566 (1981), &lt;i&gt;Buster&lt;/i&gt;  is not an authoritative precedent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  We find misplaced the Court of Appeals' reliance upon 18 U. S. C. &#167; 1151, a statute conferring upon Indian tribes jurisdiction over certain criminal acts occurring in "Indian country," or "all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States Government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and, including rights-of-way running through the reservation." See also &lt;i&gt;Duro&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Reina,&lt;/i&gt;  495 U. S. 676, 680, n. 1 (1990). Although &#167; 1151 has been relied upon to demarcate state, federal, and tribal jurisdiction over criminal and civil matters, see &lt;i&gt;DeCoteau&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;District County Court for Tenth Judicial Dist.,&lt;/i&gt;  420 U. S. 425, 427, n. 2 (1975) ("While &#167; 1151 is concerned, on its face, only with criminal jurisdiction, the Court has recognized that it generally applies as well to questions of civil jurisdiction [citing cases]"), we do not here deal with a claim of statutorily conferred power. Section 1151 simply does not address an Indian tribe's inherent or retained sovereignty over nonmembers on non-Indian fee land.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least in the context of non-Indian fee land, we also find inapt the Court of Appeals' analogy to state taxing authority. Our reference in &lt;i&gt;Merrion&lt;/i&gt; to a State's ability to tax activities with which it has a substantial nexus was made in the context of describing an Indian tribe's authority over &lt;i&gt;tribal land.&lt;/i&gt; See 455 U. S., at 137-138 (citing &lt;i&gt;Exxon Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Department of Revenue of Wis.,&lt;/i&gt; 447 U. S. 207, 228 (1980); &lt;i&gt;Japan Line, Ltd.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;County of Los Angeles,&lt;/i&gt; 441 U. S. 434, 445 (1979)). Only full territorial sovereigns enjoy the "power to enforce laws against all who come within the sovereign's territory, whether citizens or aliens," and Indian tribes "can no longer be described as sovereigns in this sense." &lt;i&gt;Duro&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Reina, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 685.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  Because the legal incidence of the tax falls directly upon the guests, not petitioner, it is unclear whether the Tribe's relationship with petitioner is at all relevant. We need not, however, decide this issue since the hotel occupancy tax exceeds the Tribe's authority even considering petitioner's contacts with the Navajo Nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  The Navajo Tribal Fire Department has responded to a fire at the Cameron Trading Post. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  The Navajo Nation charges for its emergency medical services (a flat call-out fee of $300 and a mileage fee of $6.25 per mile).See App. 127-129.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9]  See Reply Brief for Petitioners13-14 and Brief for United States as &lt;i&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 29 in &lt;i&gt;Strate&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;A-1 Contractors&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; O. T. 1996, No. 95-1872.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[10]  Although the regulations do not "preclude" the Navajo Nation from imposing upon "Indian traders" such "fees or taxes [it] may deem appropriate,"the regulations do not contemplate or authorize the hotel occupancy tax at issue here. 25 CFR &#167; 141.11 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[11]  The record does not reflect the amount of non-Indian fee land within the Navajo Nation. A 1995 study commissioned by the United States Department of Commerce states that 96.3 percent of the Navajo Nation's 16,224,896 acres is tribally owned, with allotted land comprising 762,749 acres, or 4.7 percent, of the reservation. See Economic Development Administration, V. Tiller, American Indian Reservations and Indian Trust Areas 214 (1995). The 1990 Census reports that that 96.6 percent of residents on the Navajo Nation are Indian. Joint Lodging 182. The Cameron Chapter of the Navajo Nation, in which petitioner's land lies, has a non-Indian population of 2.3 percent. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 181.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[12]  Although language in &lt;i&gt;Merrion&lt;/i&gt; referred to taxation as "necessary to tribal self-government and territorial management," 455 U. S., at 141, it did not address assertions of tribal jurisdiction over non-Indian fee land. Just as with &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; `s first exception, incorporating &lt;i&gt;Merrion&lt;/i&gt; `s reasoning here would be tantamount to rejecting &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; `s general rule. In &lt;i&gt;Strate&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;A-1 Contractors,&lt;/i&gt; 520 U. S. 438, 459 (1997), we stated that &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; `s second exception "can be misperceived." The exception is only triggered by &lt;i&gt;nonmember conduct&lt;/i&gt; that threatens the Indian tribe; it does not broadly permit the exercise of civil authority wherever it might be considered "necessary" to self-government. Thus, unless the drain of the nonmember's conduct upon tribal services and resources is so severe that itactually "imperil[s]" the political integrity of the Indian tribe, there can be no assertion of civil authority beyond tribal lands. &lt;i&gt;Montana,&lt;/i&gt; 450 U. S., at 566. Petitioner's hotel has no such adverse effect upon the Navajo Nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[13]  Justice Stevens' opinion in &lt;i&gt;Brendale&lt;/i&gt; sets out in some detail the restrictive nature of "closed area" surrounding the non-Indian fee land. See 492 U. S., at 438-441. Pursuant to the powers reserved it in an 1855 treaty with the United States, the Yakima Nation closed this forested area to the public and severely limited the activities of those who entered the land through a "courtesy permit system." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 439 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The record here establishes that, save a few natural areas and parks not at issue, the Navajo Reservation is open to the general public. App. 61.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[14]  See &lt;i&gt;Strate&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;A-1 Contractors, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 447, n. 6 (noting that the Yakima Nation "retained zoning authority . . . only in the closed area"); &lt;i&gt;Duro&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Reina,&lt;/i&gt; 495 U. S., at 688 (noting that zoning "is vital to the maintenance of tribal integrity and self-determination").&lt;/p&gt;

v.&lt;br&gt;
MAINE&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;No. 130, Orig.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;United States Supreme Court.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued April 16, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided May 29, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
ON MOTION TO DISMISS COMPLAINT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*744&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*744&lt;/span&gt; Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except Souter, J., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Paul D. Stern,&lt;/i&gt; Deputy Attorney General of Maine, argued the cause for defendant. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;An-&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*745&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;drew Ketterer,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;Christopher C. Taub&lt;/i&gt;  and &lt;i&gt;William R. Stokes,&lt;/i&gt; Assistant Attorneys General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jeffrey P. Minear&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae.&lt;/i&gt; With him on the brief were former &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Schiffer, Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Patricia Weiss.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leslie J. Ludtke,&lt;/i&gt; Associate Attorney General of New Hampshire, argued the cause for plaintiff. With her on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Phillip T. McLaughlin,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;John R. Harrington.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Ginsburg, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Piscataqua River lies at the southeastern end of New Hampshire's boundary with Maine. The river begins at the headwaters of Salmon Falls and runs seaward into Portsmouth Harbor (also known as Piscataqua Harbor). On March 6, 2000, New Hampshire brought this original action against Maine, claiming that the Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore and that the entire river and all of Portsmouth Harbor belong to New Hampshire. Maine has filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that two prior proceedings&#151;a 1740 boundary determination by King George II and a 1977 consent judgment entered by this Court&#151;definitively fixed the Piscataqua River boundary at the middle of the river's main channel of navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1740 decree located the Piscataqua River boundary at the "Middle of the River." Because New Hampshire, in the 1977 proceeding, agreed without reservation that the words "Middle of the River" mean the middle of the Piscataqua River's main channel of navigation, we conclude that New Hampshire is estopped from asserting now that the boundary runs along the Maine shore. Accordingly, we grant Maine's motion to dismiss the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire and Maine share a border that runs from northwest to southeast. At the southeastern end of the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*746&lt;/span&gt; border, the easternmost point of New Hampshire meets the southernmost point of Maine. The boundary in this region follows the Piscataqua River eastward into Portsmouth Harbor and, from there, extends in a southeasterly direction into the sea. Twenty-five years ago, in a dispute between the two States over lobster fishing rights, this Court entered a consent judgment fixing the precise location of the "lateral marine boundary," &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; the boundary in the marine waters off the coast of New Hampshire and Maine, from the closing line of Portsmouth Harbor five miles seaward to Gosport Harbor in the Isles of Shoals. &lt;i&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maine,&lt;/i&gt;  426 U. S. 363 (1976); &lt;i&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maine,&lt;/i&gt; 434 U. S. 1, 2 (1977). This case concerns the location of the Maine-New Hampshire boundary along the inland stretch of the Piscataqua River, from the mouth of Portsmouth Harbor westward to the river's headwaters at Salmon Falls. (A map of the region appears as an appendix to this opinion.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1970's contest over the lateral marine boundary, we summarized the history of the interstate boundary in the Piscataqua River region. See &lt;i&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maine,&lt;/i&gt;  426 U. S., at 366-367. The boundary, we said, "was in fact fixed in 1740 by decree of King George II of England" as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"`That the Dividing Line shall pass up thro the Mouth of Piscataqua Harbour and up the Middle of the River . . . . And that the Dividing Line shall part the Isles of Shoals and run thro the Middle of the Harbour between the Islands to the Sea on the Southerly Side. . . .' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 366 (quoting the 1740 decree).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1976, New Hampshire and Maine "expressly agree[d]. . . that the decree of 1740 fixed the boundary in the Piscataqua Harbor area." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 367 (internal quotation marks omitted). "Their quarrel was over the location . . . of the `Mouth of Piscataqua River,' `Middle of the River,' and `Middle of the Harbour' within the contemplation of the decree." &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*747&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; The meaning of those terms was essential to delineating the lateral marine boundary. See Report of Special Master, O. T. 1975, No. 64 Orig., pp. 32-49 (hereinafter Report). In particular, the northern end of the lateral marine boundary required a determination of the point where the line marking the "Middle of the [Piscataqua] River" crosses the closing line of Piscataqua Harbor. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 43.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of litigation, New Hampshire and Maine proposed a consent decree in which they agreed, &lt;i&gt;inter alia,&lt;/i&gt;  that the words "Middle of the River" in the 1740 decree refer to the middle of the Piscataqua River's main channel of navigation. Motion for Entry of Judgment By Consent of Plaintiff and Defendant in &lt;i&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maine,&lt;/i&gt; O. T. 1973, No. 64 Orig., p. 2 (hereinafter Motion for Consent Judgment). The Special Master, upon reviewing pertinent history, rejected the States' interpretation and concluded that "the geographic middle of the river and not its main or navigable channel was intended by the 1740 decree." Report 41. This Court determined, however, that the States' interpretation "reasonably invest[ed] imprecise terms" with a definition not "wholly contrary to relevant evidence." &lt;i&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maine,&lt;/i&gt; 426 U. S., at 369. On that basis, the Court declined to adopt the Special Master's construction of "Middle of the River" and directed entry of the consent decree. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 369-370. The final decree, entered in 1977, defined "Middle of the River" as "the middle of the main channel of navigation of the Piscataqua River." &lt;i&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maine,&lt;/i&gt; 434 U. S., at 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1977 consent judgment fixed only the lateral marine boundary and not the inland Piscataqua River boundary. See Report 42-43 ("For the purposes of the present dispute, . .. it is unnecessary to lay out fully the course of the boundary as it proceeds upriver .. . ."). In the instant action, New Hampshire contends that the inland river boundary "run[s] along the low water mark on the Maine shore," Complaint 49, and asserts sovereignty over the entire river &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*748&lt;/span&gt; and all of Portsmouth Harbor, including the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on Seavey Island located within the harbor just south of Kittery, Maine, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 34.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; Relying on various historical records, New Hampshire urges that "Middle of the River," as those words were used in 1740, denotes the main branch of the river, not a midchannel boundary, Brief in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss 12-16, and that New Hampshire, not Maine, exercised sole jurisdiction over shipping and military activities in Portsmouth Harbor during the decades before and after the 1740 decree, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 17-19, and nn. 35-38.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While disagreeing with New Hampshire's understanding of history, see Motion to Dismiss 9-14, 18-19 (compiling evidence that Maine continually exercised jurisdiction over the harbor and shipyard from the 1700's to the present day), Maine primarily contends that the 1740 decree and the 1977 consent judgment divided the Piscataqua River at the middle of the main channel of navigation&#151;a division that places Seavey Island within Maine's jurisdiction. Those earlier proceedings, according to Maine, bar New Hampshire's complaint under principles of claim and issue preclusion as well as judicial estoppel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pretermit the States' competing historical claims along with their arguments on the application &lt;i&gt;vel non&lt;/i&gt; of the res judicata doctrines commonly called claim and issue preclusion. Claim preclusion generally refers to the effect of a prior judgment in foreclosing successive litigation of the very same claim, whether or not relitigation of the claim raises the same issues as the earlier suit. Issue preclusion generally refers to the effect of a prior judgment in foreclosing successive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*749&lt;/span&gt; litigated and resolved in a valid court determination essential to the prior judgment, whether or not the issue arises on the same or a different claim. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167;&#167; 17, 27, pp. 148, 250 (1980); D. Shapiro, Civil Procedure: Preclusion in Civil Actions 32, 46 (2001). In the unusual circumstances this case presents, we conclude that a discrete doctrine, judicial estoppel, best fits the controversy. Under that doctrine, we hold, New Hampshire is equitably barred from asserting&#151;contrary to its position in the 1970's litigation&#151;that the inland Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[W]here a party assumes a certain position in a legal proceeding, and succeeds in maintaining that position, he may not thereafter, simply because his interests have changed, assume a contrary position, especially if it be to the prejudice of the party who has acquiesced in the position formerly taken by him." &lt;i&gt;Davis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Wakelee,&lt;/i&gt; 156 U. S. 680, 689 (1895). This rule, known as judicial estoppel, "generally prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase." &lt;i&gt;Pegram&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Herdrich,&lt;/i&gt; 530 U. S. 211, 227, n. 8 (2000); see 18 Moore's Federal Practice &#167; 134.30, p. 134-62 (3d ed. 2000) ("The doctrine of judicial estoppel prevents a party from asserting a claim in a legal proceeding that is inconsistent with a claim taken by that party in a previous proceeding"); 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp;amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 4477, p. 782 (1981) (hereinafter Wright) ("absent any good explanation, a party should not be allowed to gain an advantage by litigation on one theory, and then seek an inconsistent advantage by pursuing an incompatible theory").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we have not had occasion to discuss the doctrine elaborately, other courts have uniformly recognized that its purpose is "to protect the integrity of the judicial process," &lt;i&gt;Edwards&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Aetna Life Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 690 F. 2d 595, 598 (CA6 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*750&lt;/span&gt; 1982), by "prohibiting parties from deliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the moment," &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;McCaskey,&lt;/i&gt; 9 F. 3d 368, 378 (CA5 1993). See &lt;i&gt;In re Cassidy,&lt;/i&gt; 892 F. 2d 637, 641 (CA7 1990) ("Judicial estoppel is a doctrine intended to prevent the perversion of the judicial process."); &lt;i&gt;Allen&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Zurich Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 667 F. 2d 1162, 1166 (CA4 1982) (judicial estoppel "protect[s] the essential integrity of the judicial process"); &lt;i&gt;Scarano&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Central R. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 203 F. 2d 510, 513 (CA3 1953) (judicial estoppel prevents parties from "playing `fast and loose with the courts' " (quoting &lt;i&gt;Stretch&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Watson,&lt;/i&gt; 6 N. J. Super. 456, 469, 69 A. 2d 596, 603 (1949))). Because the rule is intended to prevent "improper use of judicial machinery," &lt;i&gt;Konstantinidis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chen,&lt;/i&gt; 626 F. 2d 933, 938 (CADC 1980), judicial estoppel "is an equitable doctrine invoked by a court at its discretion," &lt;i&gt;Russell&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rolfs,&lt;/i&gt; 893 F. 2d 1033, 1037 (CA9 1990) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courts have observed that "[t]he circumstances under which judicial estoppel may appropriately be invoked are probably not reducible to any general formulation of principle," &lt;i&gt;Allen,&lt;/i&gt; 667 F. 2d, at 1166; accord, &lt;i&gt;Lowery&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Stovall,&lt;/i&gt;  92 F. 3d 219, 223 (CA4 1996); &lt;i&gt;Patriot Cinemas, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;General Cinema Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 834 F. 2d 208, 212 (CA1 1987). Nevertheless, several factors typically inform the decision whether to apply the doctrine in a particular case: First, a party's later position must be "clearly inconsistent" with its earlier position. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hook,&lt;/i&gt; 195 F. 3d 299, 306 (CA7 1999); &lt;i&gt;In re Coastal Plains, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 179 F. 3d 197, 206 (CA5 1999); &lt;i&gt;Hossaini&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Western Mo. Medical Center,&lt;/i&gt; 140 F. 3d 1140, 1143 (CA8 1998); &lt;i&gt;Maharaj&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bankamerica Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 128 F. 3d 94, 98 (CA2 1997). Second, courts regularly inquire whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party's earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create "the perception that either the first or the second court was misled," &lt;i&gt;Edwards,&lt;/i&gt; 690 F. 2d, at 599. Absent success &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*751&lt;/span&gt; in a prior proceeding, a party's later inconsistent position introduces no "risk of inconsistent court determinations," &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;C. I. T. Constr. Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 944 F. 2d 253, 259 (CA5 1991), and thus poses little threat to judicial integrity. See &lt;i&gt;Hook,&lt;/i&gt; 195 F. 3d, at 306; &lt;i&gt;Maharaj,&lt;/i&gt; 128 F. 3d, at 98; &lt;i&gt;Konstantinidis,&lt;/i&gt; 626 F. 2d, at 939. A third consideration is whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped. See &lt;i&gt;Davis,&lt;/i&gt; 156 U. S., at 689; &lt;i&gt;Philadelphia, W., &amp;amp; B. R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Howard,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;How.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;307&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 335-337 (1852); &lt;i&gt;Scarano,&lt;/i&gt; 203 F. 2d, at 513 (judicial estoppel forbids use of "intentional self-contradiction . . . as a means of obtaining unfair advantage"); see also 18 Wright &#167; 4477, p. 782.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In enumerating these factors, we do not establish inflexible prerequisites or an exhaustive formula for determining the applicability of judicial estoppel. Additional considerations may inform the doctrine's application in specific factual contexts. In this case, we simply observe that the factors above firmly tip the balance of equities in favor of barring New Hampshire's present complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire's claim that the Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore is clearly inconsistent with its interpretation of the words "Middle of the River" during the 1970's litigation. As mentioned above, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 747, interpretation of those words was "necessary" to fixing the northern end point of the lateral marine boundary, Report 43. New Hampshire offered two interpretations in the earlier proceeding&#151;first agreeing with Maine in the proposed consent decree that "Middle of the River" means the middle of the main channel of navigation, and later agreeing with the Special Master that the words mean the geographic middle of the river. Both constructions located the "Middle of the River" somewhere other than the Maine shore of the Piscataqua River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*752&lt;/span&gt; Moreover, the record of the 1970's dispute makes clear that this Court accepted New Hampshire's agreement with Maine that "Middle of the River" means middle of the main navigable channel, and that New Hampshire benefited from that interpretation. New Hampshire, it is true, preferred the interpretation of "Middle of the River" in the Special Master's report. See Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff in &lt;i&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maine,&lt;/i&gt; O. T. 1975, No. 64 Orig., p. 3 (hereinafter Plaintiff's Exceptions) ("the boundary now proposed by the Special Master is more favorable to [New Hampshire] than that recommended in the proposed consent decree"). But the consent decree was sufficiently favorable to New Hampshire to garner its approval. Although New Hampshire now suggests that it "compromised in Maine's favor" on the definition of "Middle of the River" in the 1970's litigation, Brief in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss 24, that "compromise" enabled New Hampshire to settle the case, see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 24-25, on terms beneficial to both States. Notably, in their joint motion for entry of the consent decree, New Hampshire and Maine represented to this Court that the proposed judgment was "in the best interest of each State." Motion for Consent Judgment 1. Relying on that representation, the Court accepted the boundary proposed by the two States. &lt;i&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maine,&lt;/i&gt; 434 U. S. 1 (1977).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At oral argument, New Hampshire urged that the consent decree simply fixed the "Middle of the River" at "an arbitrary location based on the administrative convenience of the parties." Tr. of Oral Arg. 37. To the extent New Hampshire implies that the parties settled the lateral marine boundary dispute without judicial endorsement of their interpretation of "Middle of the River," that view is foreclosed by the Court's determination that "[t]he consent decree . . . proposes a wholly permissible final resolution of the controversy both as to facts and law," &lt;i&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Maine,&lt;/i&gt; 426 U. S., at 368-369. Three dissenting Justices agreed with New Hampshire that the consent decree interpreted &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*753&lt;/span&gt; the middle-of-the-river language "by agreements of convenience" and not "in accordance with legal principles." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 371 (White, J., joined by Blackmun and Stevens, JJ., dissenting). But the Court concluded otherwise, noting that its acceptance of the consent decree involved "[n]othing remotely resembling `arbitral' rather than `judicial' functions," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 369. The consent decree "reasonably invest[ed] imprecise terms with definitions that give effect to [the 1740] decree," &lt;i&gt;ibid.,&lt;/i&gt; and "[did] not fall into the category of agreements that we reject because acceptance would not be consistent with our Art. III function and duty," &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire also contends that the 1977 consent decree was entered without "a searching historical inquiry into what that language [`Middle of the River'] meant." Tr. of Oral Arg. 39. According to New Hampshire, had it known then what it knows now about the relevant history, it would not have entered into the decree. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; We do not question that it may be appropriate to resist application of judicial estoppel "when a party's prior position was based on inadvertence or mistake." &lt;i&gt;John S. Clark Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Faggert &amp;amp; Frieden, P. C.,&lt;/i&gt; 65 F. 3d 26, 29 (CA4 1995); see &lt;i&gt;In re Corey,&lt;/i&gt;  892 F. 2d 829, 836 (CA9 1989); &lt;i&gt;Konstantinidis,&lt;/i&gt; 626 F. 2d, at 939. We are unpersuaded, however, that New Hampshire's position in 1977 fairly may be regarded as a product of inadvertence or mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pleadings in the lateral marine boundary case show that New Hampshire did engage in "a searching historical inquiry" into the meaning of "Middle of the River." See Reply Brief for Plaintiff in &lt;i&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maine,&lt;/i&gt; O. T. 1975, No. 64 Orig., pp. 3-9 (examining history of river boundaries under international law, proceedings leading up to the 1740 order of the King in Council, and relevant precedents of this Court). None of the historical evidence cited by New Hampshire remotely suggested that the Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore. In fact, in attempting to place the boundary at the geographic middle of the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*754&lt;/span&gt; river, New Hampshire acknowledged that its agents in 1740 understood the King's order to "adjudg[e] &lt;i&gt;half of the river&lt;/i&gt;  to" the portion of Massachusetts that is now Maine. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 6 (emphasis in original) (quoting N. H. State Papers, XIX, pp. 591, 596-597); see Reply Brief in No. 64 Orig., &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 4 ("&lt;i&gt;The intention of those participating in the proceedings leading to the [1740 decree] was to use `geographic middle' as the Piscataqua boundary.&lt;/i&gt; " (emphasis in original)). In addition, this Court independently determined that "there is nothing to suggest that the location of the 1740 boundary agreed upon by the States is wholly contrary to relevant evidence." &lt;i&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maine,&lt;/i&gt; 426 U. S., at 369.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor can it be said that New Hampshire lacked the opportunity or incentive to locate the river boundary at Maine's shore. In its present complaint, New Hampshire relies on historical materials&#151;primarily official documents and events from the colonial and postcolonial periods, see Brief in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss 12-19&#151;that were no less available 25 years ago than they are today. And New Hampshire had every reason to consult those materials: A river boundary running along Maine's shore would have placed the northern terminus of the lateral marine boundary much closer to Maine, "result[ing] in hundreds if not thousands of additional acres of territory being in New Hampshire rather than Maine," Tr. of Oral Arg. 48 (rebuttal argument of Maine). Tellingly, New Hampshire at the time understood the importance of placing the northern terminus as close to Maine as possible. While agreeing with the Special Master that "Middle of the River" means geographic middle, New Hampshire insisted that the geographic middle should be determined by using the banks of the river, not low tide elevations (as the Special Master had proposed), as the key reference points&#151;a methodology that would have placed the northern terminus 350 yards closer to the Maine shore. Plaintiff's Exceptions 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*755&lt;/span&gt; In short, considerations of equity persuade us that application of judicial estoppel is appropriate in this case. Having convinced this Court to accept one interpretation of "Middle of the River," and having benefited from that interpretation, New Hampshire now urges an inconsistent interpretation to gain an additional advantage at Maine's expense. Were we to accept New Hampshire's latest view, the "risk of inconsistent court determinations," &lt;i&gt;C. I. T. Constr. Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 944 F. 2d, at 259, would become a reality. We cannot interpret "Middle of the River" in the 1740 decree to mean two different things along the same boundary line without undermining the integrity of the judicial process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, notwithstanding the balance of equities, New Hampshire points to this Court's recognition that "ordinarily the doctrine of estoppel or that part of it which precludes inconsistent positions in judicial proceedings is not applied to states," &lt;i&gt;Illinois ex rel. Gordon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Campbell,&lt;/i&gt; 329 U. S. 362, 369 (1946). Of course, "broad interests of public policy may make it important to allow a change of positions that might seem inappropriate as a matter of merely private interests." 18 Wright &#167; 4477, p. 784. But this is not a case where estoppel would compromise a governmental interest in enforcing the law. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Heckler&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Community Health Services of Crawford Cty., Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 51, 60 (1984) ("When the Government is unable to enforce the law because the conduct of its agents has given rise to an estoppel, the interest of the citizenry as a whole in obedience to the rule of law is undermined. It is for this reason that it is well settled that the Government may not be estopped on the same terms as any other litigant."). Nor is this a case where the shift in the government's position is "the result of a change in public policy," &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Owens,&lt;/i&gt; 54 F. 3d 271, 275 (CA6 1995); cf. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sunnen,&lt;/i&gt; 333 U. S. 591, 601 (1948) (collateral estoppel does not apply to Commissioner where pertinent statutory provisions or Treasury &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*756&lt;/span&gt; regulations have changed between the first and second proceeding), or the result of a change in facts essential to the prior judgment, cf. &lt;i&gt;Montana&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 440 U. S. 147, 159 (1979) ("changes in facts essential to a judgment will render collateral estoppel inapplicable in a subsequent action raising the same issues"). Instead, it is a case between two States, in which each owes the other a full measure of respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has changed between 1976 and today is New Hampshire's interpretation of the historical evidence concerning the King's 1740 decree. New Hampshire advances its new interpretation not to enforce its own laws within its borders, but to adjust the border itself. Given Maine's countervailing interest in the location of the boundary, we are unable to discern any "broad interes[t] of public policy," 18 Wright &#167; 4477, p. 784, that gives New Hampshire the prerogative to construe "Middle of the River" differently today than it did 25 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the reasons stated, we conclude that judicial estoppel bars New Hampshire from asserting that the Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore. Accordingly, we grant Maine's motion to dismiss the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case raises two questions concerning the application of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 328, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12101 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; to a gifted athlete: first, whether the Act protects access to professional golf tournaments by a qualified entrant with a disability; and second, whether a &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*665&lt;/span&gt; disabled contestant may be denied the use of a golf cart because it would "fundamentally alter the nature" of the tournaments, &#167; 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), to allow him to ride when all other contestants must walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner PGA TOUR, Inc., a nonprofit entity formed in 1968, sponsors and cosponsors professional golf tournaments conducted on three annual tours. About 200 golfers participate in the PGA TOUR; about 170 in the NIKE TOUR;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; and about 100 in the SENIOR PGA TOUR. PGA TOUR and NIKE TOUR tournaments typically are 4-day events, played on courses leased and operated by petitioner. The entire field usually competes in two 18-hole rounds played on Thursday and Friday; those who survive the "cut" play on Saturday and Sunday and receive prize money in amounts determined by their aggregate scores for all four rounds. The revenues generated by television, admissions, concessions, and contributions from cosponsors amount to about $300 million a year, much of which is distributed in prize money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are various ways of gaining entry into particular tours. For example, a player who wins three NIKE TOUR events in the same year, or is among the top-15 money winners on that tour, earns the right to play in the PGA TOUR. Additionally, a golfer may obtain a spot in an official tournament through successfully competing in "open" qualifying rounds, which are conducted the week before each tournament. Most participants, however, earn playing privileges in the PGA TOUR or NIKE TOUR by way of a three-stage qualifying tournament known as the "Q-School."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any member of the public may enter the Q-School by paying a $3,000 entry fee and submitting two letters of reference &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*666&lt;/span&gt; from, among others, PGA TOUR or NIKE TOUR members. The $3,000 entry fee covers the players' greens fees and the cost of golf carts, which are permitted during the first two stages, but which have been prohibited during the third stage since 1997. Each year, over a thousand contestants compete in the first stage, which consists of four 18-hole rounds at different locations. Approximately half of them make it to the second stage, which also includes 72 holes. Around 168 players survive the second stage and advance to the final one, where they compete over 108 holes. Of those finalists, about a fourth qualify for membership in the PGA TOUR, and the rest gain membership in the NIKE TOUR. The significance of making it into either tour is illuminated by the fact that there are about 25 million golfers in the country.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three sets of rules govern competition in tour events. First, the "Rules of Golf," jointly written by the United States Golf Association (USGA) and the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of Scotland, apply to the game as it is played, not only by millions of amateurs on public courses and in private country clubs throughout the United States and worldwide, but also by the professionals in the tournaments conducted by petitioner, the USGA, the Ladies' Professional Golf Association, and the Senior Women's Golf Association. Those rules do not prohibit the use of golf carts at any time.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the "Conditions of Competition and Local Rules," often described as the "hard card," apply specifically to petitioner's professional tours. The hard cards for the PGA &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*667&lt;/span&gt; TOUR and NIKE TOUR require players to walk the golf course during tournaments, but not during open qualifying rounds.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; On the SENIOR PGA TOUR, which is limited to golfers age 50 and older, the contestants may use golf carts. Most seniors, however, prefer to walk.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, "Notices to Competitors" are issued for particular tournaments and cover conditions for that specific event. Such a notice may, for example, explain how the Rules of Golf should be applied to a particular water hazard or manmade obstruction. It might also authorize the use of carts to speed up play when there is an unusual distance between one green and the next tee.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic Rules of Golf, the hard cards, and the weekly notices apply equally to all players in tour competitions. As one of petitioner's witnesses explained with reference to "the Masters Tournament, which is golf at its very highest level, . . . the key is to have everyone tee off on the first hole under exactly the same conditions and all of them be tested over that 72-hole event under the conditions that exist during those four days of the event." App. 192.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casey Martin is a talented golfer. As an amateur, he won 17 Oregon Golf Association junior events before he was 15, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*668&lt;/span&gt; and won the state championship as a high school senior. He played on the Stanford University golf team that won the 1994 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championship. As a professional, Martin qualified for the NIKE TOUR in 1998 and 1999, and based on his 1999 performance, qualified for the PGA TOUR in 2000. In the 1999 season, he entered 24 events, made the cut 13 times, and had 6 top-10 finishes, coming in second twice and third once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin is also an individual with a disability as defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA or Act).&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; Since birth he has been afflicted with Klippel-TrenaunayWeber Syndrome, a degenerative circulatory disorder that obstructs the flow of blood from his right leg back to his heart. The disease is progressive; it causes severe pain and has atrophied his right leg. During the latter part of his college career, because of the progress of the disease, Martin could no longer walk an 18-hole golf course.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; Walking not only caused him pain, fatigue, and anxiety, but also created a significant risk of hemorrhaging, developing blood clots, and fracturing his tibia so badly that an amputation might be required. For these reasons, Stanford made written requests to the Pacific 10 Conference and the NCAA to waive for Martin their rules requiring players to walk and carry their own clubs. The requests were granted.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*669&lt;/span&gt; When Martin turned pro and entered petitioner's Q-School, the hard card permitted him to use a cart during his successful progress through the first two stages. He made a request, supported by detailed medical records, for permission to use a golf cart during the third stage. Petitioner refused to review those records or to waive its walking rule for the third stage. Martin therefore filed this action. A preliminary injunction entered by the District Court made it possible for him to use a cart in the final stage of the Q-School and as a competitor in the NIKE TOUR and PGA TOUR. Although not bound by the injunction, and despite its support for petitioner's position in this litigation, the USGA voluntarily granted Martin a similar waiver in events that it sponsors, including the U. S. Open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the District Court, petitioner moved for summary judgment on the ground that it is exempt from coverage under Title III of the ADA as a "private clu[b] or establishmen[t]," &lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; or alternatively, that the play areas of its tour competitions do not constitute places of "public accommodation" within the scope of that Title.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; The Magistrate Judge concluded that petitioner should be viewed as a commercial enterprise operating in the entertainment industry for the economic benefit of its members rather than as a private &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*670&lt;/span&gt; club. Furthermore, after noting that the statutory definition of public accommodation included a "golf course,"&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt; he rejected petitioner's argument that its competitions are only places of public accommodation in the areas open to spectators. The operator of a public accommodation could not, in his view, "create private enclaves within the facility . . . and thus relegate the ADA to hop-scotch areas." &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ord/8bFY/martin-v-pga-tour-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;984&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1320&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 1326-1327 (Ore. 1998). Accordingly, he denied petitioner's motion for summary judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At trial, petitioner did not contest the conclusion that Martin has a disability covered by the ADA, or the fact "that his disability prevents him from walking the course during a round of golf." &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ord/8R5T/martin-v-pga-tour-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;994&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1242&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 1244 (Ore. 1998). Rather, petitioner asserted that the condition of walking is a substantive rule of competition, and that waiving it as to any individual for any reason would fundamentally alter the nature of the competition. Petitioner's evidence included the testimony of a number of experts, among them some of the greatest golfers in history. Arnold Palmer,&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt; Jack Nicklaus,&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; and Ken Venturi&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt; explained that fatigue can be &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*671&lt;/span&gt; a critical factor in a tournament, particularly on the last day when psychological pressure is at a maximum. Their testimony makes it clear that, in their view, permission to use a cart might well give some players a competitive advantage over other players who must walk. They did not, however, express any opinion on whether a cart would give Martin such an advantage.&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejecting petitioner's argument that an individualized inquiry into the necessity of the walking rule in Martin's case would be inappropriate, the District Court stated that it had "the independent duty to inquire into the purpose of the rule at issue, and to ascertain whether there can be a reasonable modification made to accommodate plaintiff without frustrating the purpose of the rule" and thereby fundamentally altering the nature of petitioner's tournaments. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1246. The judge found that the purpose of the rule was to inject fatigue into the skill of shotmaking, but that the fatigue injected "by walking the course cannot be deemed significant under normal circumstances." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1250. Furthermore, Martin presented evidence, and the judge found, that even with the use of a cart, Martin must walk over a mile during &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*672&lt;/span&gt; an 18-hole round,&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt; and that the fatigue he suffers from coping with his disability is "undeniably greater" than the fatigue his able-bodied competitors endure from walking the course. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1251. As the judge observed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[P]laintiff is in significant pain when he walks, and even when he is getting in and out of the cart. With each step, he is at risk of fracturing his tibia and hemorrhaging. The other golfers have to endure the psychological stress of competition as part of their fatigue; Martin has the same stress plus the added stress of pain and risk of serious injury. As he put it, he would gladly trade the cart for a good leg. To perceive that the cart puts him&#151;with his condition&#151;at a competitive advantage is a gross distortion of reality." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1251-1252.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the judge concluded that it would "not fundamentally alter the nature of the PGA Tour's game to accommodate him with a cart." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1252. The judge accordingly entered a permanent injunction requiring petitioner to permit Martin to use a cart in tour and qualifying events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On appeal to the Ninth Circuit, petitioner did not challenge the District Court's rejection of its claim that it was exempt as a "private club," but it renewed the contention that during a tournament the portion of the golf course "`behind the ropes' is not a public accommodation because the public has no right to enter it." 204 F. 3d 994, 997 (2000). The Court of Appeals viewed that contention as resting on the incorrect assumption that the competition among participants was not itself public. The court first pointed out that, as with a private university, "the fact that users of a facility are highly selected does not mean that the facility cannot be &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*673&lt;/span&gt; a public accommodation." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 998.&lt;sup&gt;[18]&lt;/sup&gt; In its opinion, the competition to enter the select circle of PGA TOUR and NIKE TOUR golfers was comparable because "[a]ny member of the public who pays a $3000 entry fee and supplies two letters of recommendation may try out in the qualifying school." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 999. The court saw "no justification in reason or in the statute to draw a line beyond which the performance of athletes becomes so excellent that a competition restricted to their level deprives its situs of the character of a public accommodation." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Nor did it find a basis for distinguishing between "use of a place of public accommodation for pleasure and use in the pursuit of a living." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt;  Consequently, the Court of Appeals concluded that golf courses remain places of public accommodation during PGA tournaments. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the merits, because there was no serious dispute about the fact that permitting Martin to use a golf cart was both a reasonable and a necessary solution to the problem of providing him access to the tournaments, the Court of Appeals regarded the central dispute as whether such permission would "fundamentally alter" the nature of the PGA TOUR or NIKE TOUR. Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals viewed the issue not as "whether use of carts generally would fundamentally alter the competition, but whether the use of a cart by Martin would do so." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1001. That issue turned on "an intensively fact-based inquiry," and, the court concluded, had been correctly resolved by the trial judge. In its words, "[a]ll that the cart does is permit Martin access to a type of competition in which he otherwise could not engage because of his disability." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*674&lt;/span&gt; The day after the Ninth Circuit ruled in Martin's favor, the Seventh Circuit came to a contrary conclusion in a case brought against the USGA by a disabled golfer who failed to qualify for "America's greatest&#151;and most democratic&#151;golf tournament, the United States Open." &lt;i&gt;Olinger&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States Golf Assn.,&lt;/i&gt; 205 F. 3d 1001 (2000).&lt;sup&gt;[19]&lt;/sup&gt; The Seventh Circuit endorsed the conclusion of the District Court in that case that "the nature of the competition would be fundamentally altered if the walking rule were eliminated because it would remove stamina (at least a particular type of stamina) from the set of qualities designed to be tested in this competition." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1006 (internal quotation marks omitted). In the Seventh Circuit's opinion, the physical ordeals endured by Ken Venturi and Ben Hogan when they walked to their Open victories in 1964 and 1950 amply demonstrated the importance of stamina in such a tournament.&lt;sup&gt;[20]&lt;/sup&gt; As an alternative basis for its holding, the court also concluded that the ADA does not require the USGA to bear "the administrative burdens of evaluating requests to waive the walking rule and permit the use of a golf cart." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Seventh Circuit merely assumed that the ADA applies to professional golf tournaments, and therefore did not disagree with the Ninth on the threshold coverage issue, our grant of certiorari, 530 U. S. 1306 (2000), encompasses that question as well as the conflict between those courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress enacted the ADA in 1990 to remedy widespread discrimination against disabled individuals. In studying the need for such legislation, Congress found that "historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*675&lt;/span&gt; disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12101(a)(2); see &#167; 12101(a)(3) ("[D]iscrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as employment, housing, public accommodations, education, transportation, communication, recreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, and access to public services"). Congress noted that the many forms such discrimination takes include "outright intentional exclusion" as well as the "failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices." &#167; 12101(a)(5). After thoroughly investigating the problem, Congress concluded that there was a "compelling need" for a "clear and comprehensive national mandate" to eliminate discrimination against disabled individuals, and to integrate them "into the economic and social mainstream of American life." S. Rep. No. 101-116, p. 20 (1989); H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, p. 50 (1990).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ADA, Congress provided that broad mandate. See 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12101(b). In fact, one of the Act's "most impressive strengths" has been identified as its "comprehensive character," Hearings on S. 933 before the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources and the Subcommittee on the Handicapped, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 197 (1989) (statement of Attorney General Thornburgh), and accordingly the Act has been described as "a milestone on the path to a more decent, tolerant, progressive society," &lt;i&gt;Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Garrett,&lt;/i&gt; 531 U. S. 356, 375 (2001) (Kennedy, J., concurring). To effectuate its sweeping purpose, the ADA forbids discrimination against disabled individuals in major areas of public life, among them employment (Title I of the Act),&lt;sup&gt;[21]&lt;/sup&gt; public services (Title II),&lt;sup&gt;[22]&lt;/sup&gt; and public accommodations (Title III).&lt;sup&gt;[23]&lt;/sup&gt; At issue now, as a threshold matter, is &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*676&lt;/span&gt; the applicability of Title III to petitioner's golf tours and qualifying rounds, in particular to petitioner's treatment of a qualified disabled golfer wishing to compete in those events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title III of the ADA prescribes, as a "[g]eneral rule":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"No individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12182(a).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase "public accommodation" is defined in terms of 12 extensive categories,&lt;sup&gt;[24]&lt;/sup&gt; which the legislative history indicates "should be construed liberally" to afford people with disabilities &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*677&lt;/span&gt; "equal access" to the wide variety of establishments available to the nondisabled.&lt;sup&gt;[25]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems apparent, from both the general rule and the comprehensive definition of "public accommodation," that petitioner's golf tours and their qualifying rounds fit comfortably within the coverage of Title III, and Martin within its protection. The events occur on "golf course[s]," a type of place specifically identified by the Act as a public accommodation. &#167; 12181(7)(L). In addition, at all relevant times, petitioner "leases" and "operates" golf courses to conduct its Q-School and tours. &#167; 12182(a). As a lessor and operator of golf courses, then, petitioner must not discriminate against any "individual" in the "full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities,privileges, advantages, or accommodations" of those courses. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Certainly, among the "privileges" offered by petitioner on the courses are those of competing in the Q-School and playing in the tours; indeed, the former is a privilege for which thousands of individuals from the general public pay, and the latter is one for which they vie. Martin, of course, is one of those individuals. It would therefore appear that Title III of the ADA, by its plain terms, prohibits petitioner from denying Martin equal access to its tours on the basis of his disability. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Yeskey,&lt;/i&gt; 524 U. S. 206, 209 (1998) (holding that text of Title II's prohibition of discrimination by "public entities" against disabled individuals "unmistakably includes State prisons and prisoners within its coverage").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner argues otherwise. To be clear about its position,it does not assert (as it did in the District Court) that it is a private club altogether exempt from Title III' scoverage. In fact, petitioner admits that its tournaments are conducted at places of public accommodation.&lt;sup&gt;[26]&lt;/sup&gt; Nor does petitioner contend (as it did in both the District Court and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*678&lt;/span&gt; the Court of Appeals) that the competitors' area "behind the ropes" is not a public accommodation, notwithstanding the status of the rest of the golf course. Rather, petitioner reframes the coverage issue by arguing that the competing golfers are not members of the class protected by Title III of the ADA.&lt;sup&gt;[27]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to petitioner, Title III is concerned with discrimination against "clients and customers" seeking to obtain "goods and services" at places of public accommodation, whereas it is Title I that protects persons who work at such places.&lt;sup&gt;[28]&lt;/sup&gt; As the argument goes, petitioner operates not a "golf course" during its tournaments but a "place of exhibition or entertainment," 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12181(7)(C), and a professional golfer such as Martin, like an actor in a theater production, is a provider rather than a consumer of the entertainment that petitioner sells to the public. Martin therefore cannot bring a claim under Title III because he is not one of the "`&lt;i&gt;clients or customers&lt;/i&gt; of the covered public accommodation.' "&lt;sup&gt;[29]&lt;/sup&gt; Rather, Martin's claim of discrimination is "job-related"&lt;sup&gt;[30]&lt;/sup&gt; and could only be brought under Title I&#151;but that Title does not apply because he is an independent contractor (as the District Court found) rather than an employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference to "clients or customers" that petitioner quotes appears in 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12182(b)(1)(A)(iv), which &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*679&lt;/span&gt; states: "For purposes of clauses (i) through (iii) of this subparagraph, the term `individual or class of individuals' refers to the clients or customers of the covered public accommodation that enters into the contractual, licensing or other arrangement." Clauses (i) through (iii) of the subparagraph prohibit public accommodations from discriminating against a disabled "individual or class of individuals" in certain ways&lt;sup&gt;[31]&lt;/sup&gt; either directly or indirectly through contractual arrangements with other entities. Those clauses make clear on the one hand that their prohibitions cannot be avoided by means of contract, while clause (iv) makes clear on the other hand that contractual relationships will not expand a public accommodation's obligations under the subparagraph beyond its own clients or customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As petitioner recognizes, clause (iv) is not literally applicable to Title III's general rule prohibiting discrimination against disabled individuals.&lt;sup&gt;[32]&lt;/sup&gt; Title III's broad general rule contains no express "clients or customers" limitation, &#167; 12182(a), and &#167; 12182(b)(1)(A)(iv) provides that its limitation is only "[f]or purposes of" the clauses in that separate subparagraph. Nevertheless, petitioner contends that clause (iv)'s restriction of the subparagraph's coverage to the clients or customers of public accommodations fairly describes the scope of Title III's protection as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need not decide whether petitioner's construction of the statute is correct, because petitioner's argument falters even on its own terms. If Title III's protected class were limited to "clients or customers," it would be entirely appropriate to classify the golfers who pay petitioner $3,000 for the chance to compete in the Q-School and, if successful, in the subsequent tour events, as petitioner's clients or customers. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*680&lt;/span&gt; In our view, petitioner's tournaments (whether situated at a "golf course" or at a "place of exhibition or entertainment") simultaneously offer at least two "privileges" to the public&#151;that of watching the golf competition and that of competing in it. Although the latter is more difficult and more expensive to obtain than the former, it is nonetheless a privilege that petitioner makes available to members of the general public. In consideration of the entry fee, any golfer with the requisite letters of recommendation acquires the opportunity to qualify for and compete in petitioner's tours. Additionally, any golfer who succeeds in the open qualifying rounds for a tournament may play in the event. That petitioner identifies one set of clients or customers that it serves (spectators at tournaments) does not preclude it from having another set (players in tournaments) against whom it may not discriminate. It would be inconsistent with the literal text of the statute as well as its expansive purpose to read Title III's coverage, even given petitioner's suggested limitation, any less broadly.&lt;sup&gt;[33]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*681&lt;/span&gt; Our conclusion is consistent with case law in the analogous context of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 243, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000a &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; Title II of that Act prohibits public accommodations from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin. &#167; 2000a(a). In &lt;i&gt;Daniel&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Paul,&lt;/i&gt; 395 U. S. 298, 306 (1969), applying Title II to the Lake Nixon Club in Little Rock, Arkansas, we held that the definition of a "place of exhibition or entertainment," as a public accommodation, covered participants "in some sport or activity" as well as "spectators or listeners." We find equally persuasive two lower court opinions applying Title II specifically to golfers and golf tournaments. In &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Laurel Links, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/vaed/9zUL/evans-v-laurel-links-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;261&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;474&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 477 (ED Va. 1966), a class action brought to require a commercial golf establishment to permit black golfers to play on its course, the District Court held that Title II "is not limited to spectators if the place of exhibition or entertainment provides facilities for the public to participate in the entertainment."&lt;sup&gt;[34]&lt;/sup&gt; And in &lt;i&gt;Wesley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Savannah,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/gasd/aE1V/wesley-v-city-of-savannah-georgia/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;294&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;698&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (SD Ga. 1969), the District Court found that a private association violated Title II when it limited entry in a golf tournament on a municipal course to its own members but permitted all (and only) white golfers who paid the membership and entry fees to compete.&lt;sup&gt;[35]&lt;/sup&gt; These cases support our conclusion that, as a public accommodation during its tours and qualifying rounds, petitioner may not discriminate against either spectators or competitors on the basis of disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;V&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have noted, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12182(a) sets forth Title III's general rule prohibiting public accommodations from &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*682&lt;/span&gt; discriminating against individuals because of their disabilities. The question whether petitioner has violated that rule depends on a proper construction of the term "discrimination," which is defined by Title III to include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"a failure to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to individuals with disabilities, &lt;i&gt;unless the entity can demonstrate that&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;making such modifications would fundamentally alter&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;the nature&lt;/i&gt; of such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations." &#167; 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii) (emphasis added).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner does not contest that a golf cart is a reasonable modification that is necessary if Martin is to play in its tournaments. Martin's claim thus differs from one that might be asserted by players with less serious afflictions that make walking the course uncomfortable or difficult, but not beyond their capacity. In such cases, an accommodation might be reasonable but not necessary. In this case, however, the narrow dispute is whether allowing Martin to use a golf cart, despite the walking requirement that applies to the PGA TOUR, the NIKE TOUR, and the third stage of the Q-School, is a modification that would "fundamentally alter the nature" of those events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, a modification of petitioner's golf tournaments might constitute a fundamental alteration in two different ways. It might alter such an essential aspect of the game of golf that it would be unacceptable even if it affected all competitors equally; changing the diameter of the hole from three to six inches might be such a modification.&lt;sup&gt;[36]&lt;/sup&gt; Alternatively, a less significant change that has only a peripheral &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*683&lt;/span&gt; impact on the game itself might nevertheless give a disabled player, in addition to access to the competition as required by Title III, an advantage over others and, for that reason, fundamentally alter the character of the competition.&lt;sup&gt;[37]&lt;/sup&gt; We are not persuaded that a waiver of the walking rule for Martin would work a fundamental alteration in either sense.&lt;sup&gt;[38]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an initial matter, we observe that the use of carts is not itself inconsistent with the fundamental character of the game of golf. From early on, the essence of the game has been shotmaking&#151;using clubs to cause a ball to progress from the teeing ground to a hole some distance away with as few strokes as possible.&lt;sup&gt;[39]&lt;/sup&gt; That essential aspect of the game &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*684&lt;/span&gt; is still reflected in the very first of the Rules of Golf, which declares: "The Game of Golf consists in playing a ball from the &lt;i&gt;teeing ground&lt;/i&gt; into the hole by a &lt;i&gt;stroke&lt;/i&gt; or successive strokes in accordance with the rules." Rule 1-1, Rules of Golf, App. 104 (emphasis in original). Over the years, there have been many changes in the players' equipment, in golf course design, in the Rules of Golf, and in the method of transporting clubs from hole to hole.&lt;sup&gt;[40]&lt;/sup&gt; Originally, so few clubs were used that each player could carry them without &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*685&lt;/span&gt; a bag. Then came golf bags, caddies, carts that were pulled by hand, and eventually motorized carts that carried players as well as clubs. "Golf carts started appearing with increasing regularity on American golf courses in the 1950's. Today they are everywhere. And they are encouraged. For one thing, they often speed up play, and for another, they are great revenue producers."&lt;sup&gt;[41]&lt;/sup&gt; There is nothing in the Rules of Golf that either forbids the use of carts or penalizes a player for using a cart. That set of rules, as we have observed, is widely accepted in both the amateur and professional golf world as the rules of the game.&lt;sup&gt;[42]&lt;/sup&gt; The walking rule that is contained in petitioner's hard cards, based on an optional condition buried in an appendix to the Rules of Golf,&lt;sup&gt;[43]&lt;/sup&gt; is not an essential attribute of the game itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the walking rule is not an indispensable feature of tournament golf either. As already mentioned, petitioner permits golf carts to be used in the SENIOR PGA TOUR, the open qualifying events for petitioner's tournaments, the first two stages of the Q-School, and, until 1997, the third stage of the Q-School as well. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 665-667. Moreover, petitioner allows the use of carts during certain tournament rounds in both the PGA TOUR and the NIKE &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*686&lt;/span&gt; TOUR. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 667, and n. 6. In addition, although the USGA enforces a walking rule in most of the tournaments that it sponsors, it permits carts in the Senior Amateur and the Senior Women's Amateur championships.&lt;sup&gt;[44]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner, however, distinguishes the game of golf as it is generally played from the game that it sponsors in the PGA TOUR, NIKE TOUR, and (at least recently) the last stage of the Q-School&#151;golf at the "highest level." According to petitioner, "[t]he goal of the highest-level competitive athletics is to assess and compare the performance of different competitors, a task that is meaningful only if the competitors are subject to identical substantive rules."&lt;sup&gt;[45]&lt;/sup&gt; The waiver of any possibly "outcome-affecting" rule for a contestant would violate this principle and therefore, in petitioner's view, fundamentally alter the nature of the highest level athletic event.&lt;sup&gt;[46]&lt;/sup&gt; The walking rule is one such rule, petitioner submits, because its purpose is "to inject the element of fatigue into the skill of shot-making,"&lt;sup&gt;[47]&lt;/sup&gt; and thus its effect may be the critical loss of a stroke. As a consequence, the reasonable modification Martin seeks would fundamentally alter the nature of petitioner's highest level tournaments even if he were the only person in the world who has both the talent to compete in those elite events and a disability sufficiently serious that he cannot do so without using a cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The force of petitioner's argument is, first of all, mitigated by the fact that golf is a game in which it is impossible to guarantee that all competitors will play under exactly the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*687&lt;/span&gt; same conditions or that an individual's ability will be the sole determinant of the outcome. For example, changes in the weather may produce harder greens and more head winds for the tournament leader than for his closest pursuers. A lucky bounce may save a shot or two.&lt;sup&gt;[48]&lt;/sup&gt; Whether such happenstance events are more or less probable than the likelihood that a golfer afflicted with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome would one day qualify for the NIKE TOUR and PGA TOUR, they at least demonstrate that pure chance may have a greater impact on the outcome of elite golf tournaments than the fatigue resulting from the enforcement of the walking rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the factual basis of petitioner's argument is undermined by the District Court's finding that the fatigue from walking during one of petitioner's 4-day tournaments cannot be deemed significant. The District Court credited the testimony of a professor in physiology and expert on fatigue, who calculated the calories expended in walking a golf course (about five miles) to be approximately 500 calories&#151; "`nutritionally . . .less than a Big Mac.'" 994 F. Supp., at 1250. What is more, that energy is expended over a 5-hour period, during which golfers have numerous intervals for rest and refreshment. In fact, the expert concluded, because golf is a low intensity activity, fatigue from the game is primarily a psychological phenomenon in which stress and motivation are the key ingredients. And even under conditions of severe heat and humidity, the critical factor in fatigue is fluid loss rather than exercise from walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, when given the option of using a cart, the majority of golfers in petitioner's tournaments have chosen to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*688&lt;/span&gt; walk, often to relieve stress or for other strategic reasons.&lt;sup&gt;[49]&lt;/sup&gt; As NIKE TOUR member Eric Johnson testified, walking allows him to keep in rhythm, stay warmer when it is chilly, and develop a better sense of the elements and the course than riding a cart.&lt;sup&gt;[50]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we accept the factual predicate for petitioner's argument&#151;that the walking rule is "outcome affecting" because fatigue may adversely affect performance&#151;its legal position is fatally flawed. Petitioner's refusal to consider Martin's personal circumstances in deciding whether to accommodate his disability runs counter to the clear language and purpose of the ADA. As previously stated, the ADA was enacted to eliminate discrimination against "individuals" with disabilities, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12101(b)(1), and to that end Title III of the Act requires without exception that any "policies, practices, or procedures" of a public accommodation be reasonably modified for disabled "individuals" as necessary to afford access unless doing so would fundamentally alter what is offered, &#167; 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii). To comply with this command, an individualized inquiry must be made to determine whether a specific modification for a particular person's disability would be reasonable under the circumstances as well as necessary for that person, and yet at the same time not work a fundamental alteration. See S. Rep. No. 101-116, at 61; H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 102 (public accommodations "are required to make decisions based on facts applicable to individuals"). Cf. &lt;i&gt;Sutton&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United Air Lines, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt;  527 U. S. 471, 483 (1999) ("[W]hether a person has a disability under the ADA is an individualized inquiry").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*689&lt;/span&gt; To be sure, the waiver of an essential rule of competition for anyone would fundamentally alter the nature of petitioner's tournaments. As we have demonstrated, however, the walking rule is at best peripheral to the nature of petitioner's athletic events, and thus it might be waived in individual cases without working a fundamental alteration. Therefore, petitioner's claim that all the substantive rules for its "highest-level" competitions are sacrosanct and cannot be modified under any circumstances is effectively a contention that it is exempt from Title III's reasonable modification requirement. But that provision carves out no exemption for elite athletics, and given Title III's coverage not only of places of "exhibition or entertainment" but also of "golf course[s]," 42 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 12181(7)(C), (L), its application to petitioner's tournaments cannot be said to be unintended or unexpected, see &#167;&#167; 12101(a)(1), (5). Even if it were, "the fact that a statute can be applied in situations not expressly anticipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity. It demonstrates breadth." &lt;i&gt;Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Yeskey,&lt;/i&gt; 524 U. S., at 212 (internal quotation marks omitted).&lt;sup&gt;[51]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*690&lt;/span&gt; Under the ADA's basic requirement that the need of a disabled person be evaluated on an individual basis, we have no doubt that allowing Martin to use a golf cart would not fundamentally alter the nature of petitioner's tournaments. As we have discussed, the purpose of the walking rule is to subject players to fatigue, which in turn may influence the outcome of tournaments. Even if the rule does serve that purpose, it is an uncontested finding of the District Court that Martin "easily endures greater fatigue even with a cart than his able-bodied competitors do by walking." 994 F. Supp., at 1252. The purpose of the walking rule is therefore not compromised in the slightest by allowing Martin to use a cart. A modification that provides an exception to a peripheral tournament rule without impairing its purpose cannot be said to "fundamentally alter" the tournament. What it can be said to do, on the other hand, is to allow Martin the chance to qualify for, and compete in, the athletic events petitioner offers to those members of the public who have the skill and desire to enter. That is exactly what the ADA requires.&lt;sup&gt;[52]&lt;/sup&gt; As a result, Martin's request for a waiver of the walking rule should have been granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADA admittedly imposes some administrative burdens on the operators of places of public accommodation that could be avoided by strictly adhering to general rules and policies that are entirely fair with respect to the able-bodied but that may indiscriminately preclude access by qualified persons with disabilities.&lt;sup&gt;[53]&lt;/sup&gt; But surely, in a case of this kind, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*691&lt;/span&gt; Congress intended that an entity like the PGA not only give individualized attention to the handful of requests that it might receive from talented but disabled athletes for a modification or waiver of a rule to allow them access to the competition, but also carefully weigh the purpose, as well as the letter, of the rule before determining that no accommodation would be tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my view today's opinion exercises a benevolent compassion that the law does not place it within our power to impose. The judgment distorts the text of Title III, the structure of the ADA, and common sense. I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court holds that a professional sport is a place of public accommodation and that respondent is a "custome[r]" of "competition" when he practices his profession. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 679-680. It finds, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 680, that this strange conclusion is compelled by the "literal text" of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12101 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; by the "expansive purpose" of the ADA, and by the fact that Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000a(a), has been applied to an amusement park and public golf courses. I disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADA has three separate titles: Title I covers employment discrimination, Title II covers discrimination by &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*692&lt;/span&gt; government entities, and Title III covers discrimination by places of public accommodation. Title II is irrelevant to this case. Title I protects only "employees" of employers who have 15 or more employees, &#167;&#167; 12112(a), 12111(5)(A). It does not protect independent contractors. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Birchem&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Knights of Columbus,&lt;/i&gt; 116 F. 3d 310, 312-313 (CA8 1997); cf. &lt;i&gt;Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Darden,&lt;/i&gt; 503 U. S. 318, 322&#151; 323 (1992). Respondent claimed employment discrimination under Title I, but the District Court found him to be an independent contractor rather than an employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent also claimed protection under &#167; 12182 of Title III. That section applies only to particular places and persons. The place must be a "place of public accommodation," and the person must be an "individual" seeking "enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations" of the covered place. &#167; 12182(a). Of course a court indiscriminately invoking the "sweeping" and "expansive" purposes of the ADA, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 675, 680, could argue that when a place of public accommodation denied &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt;  "individual," on the basis of his disability, &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; that might be called a "privileg[e]," the individual has a valid Title III claim. Cf. &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 677. On such an interpretation, the employees and independent contractors of every place of public accommodation come within Title III: The employee enjoys the "privilege" of employment, the contractor the "privilege" of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many reasons, Title III will not bear such an interpretation. The provision of Title III at issue here (&#167; 12182, its principal provision) is a public-accommodation law, and it is the traditional understanding of public-accommodation laws that they provide rights for &lt;i&gt;customers.&lt;/i&gt; "At common law, innkeepers, smiths, and others who made profession of a public employment, were prohibited from refusing, without good reason, to serve a customer." &lt;i&gt;Hurley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 515 U. S. 557, 571 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*693&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 379 U. S. 241 (1964). This understanding is clearly reflected in the text of Title III itself. Section 12181(7) lists 12 specific types of entities that qualify as "public accommodations," with a follow-on expansion that makes it clear what the "enjoyment of the goods, services, etc.," of those entities consists of&#151;and it plainly envisions that the person "enjoying" the "public accommodation" will be a &lt;i&gt;customer.&lt;/i&gt; For example, Title III is said to cover an "auditorium" or "other place of public gathering," &#167; 12181(7)(D). Thus, "gathering" is the distinctive enjoyment derived from an auditorium; the persons "gathering" at an auditorium are presumably covered by Title III, but those contracting to clean the auditorium are not. Title III is said to cover a "zoo" or "other place of recreation," &#167; 12181(7)(I). The persons "recreat[ing]" at a "zoo" are presumably covered, but the animal handlers bringing in the latest panda are not. The one place where Title III specifically addresses discrimination by places of public accommodation through "contractual" arrangements, it makes clear that discrimination against the other party to the contract is not covered, but only discrimination against "clients or customers of the covered public accommodation that enters into the contractual, licensing or other arrangement." &#167; 12182(b)(1)(A)(iv). And finally, the regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice reinforce the conclusion that Title III's protections extend only to customers. "The purpose of the ADA's public accommodations requirements," they say, "is to ensure accessibility to the goods offered by a public accommodation." 28 CFR, ch. 1, pt. 36, App. B, p. 650 (2000). Surely this has nothing to do with employees and independent contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there were any doubt left that &#167; 12182 covers only clients and customers of places of public accommodation, it is eliminated by the fact that a contrary interpretation would make a muddle of the ADA as a whole. The words of Title III must be read "in their context and with a view to their &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*694&lt;/span&gt; place in the overall statutory scheme." &lt;i&gt;Davis&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Michigan Dept. of Treasury,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 803, 809 (1989). Congress expressly excluded employers of fewer than 15 employees from Title I. The mom-and-pop grocery store or laundromat need not worry about altering the nonpublic areas of its place of business to accommodate handicapped employees&#151;or about the litigation that failure to do so will invite. Similarly, since independent contractors are not covered by Title I, the small business (or the large one, for that matter) need not worry about making special accommodations for the painters, electricians, and other independent workers whose services are contracted for from time to time. It is an entirely unreasonable interpretation of the statute to say that these exemptions so carefully crafted in Title I are entirely eliminated by Title III (for the many businesses that are places of public accommodation) because employees and independent contractors "enjoy" the employment and contracting that such places provide. The only &lt;i&gt;distinctive&lt;/i&gt; feature of places of public accommodation is that they accommodate the &lt;i&gt;public,&lt;/i&gt; and Congress could have no conceivable reason for according the employees and independent contractors of such businesses protections that employees and independent contractors of other businesses do not enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States apparently agrees that employee claims are not cognizable under Title III, see Brief for United States as &lt;i&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 18-19, n. 17, but despite the implications of its own regulations, see 28 CFR, ch. 1, pt. 36, App. B, at 650, appears to believe (though it does not explicitly state) that claims of independent contractors are cognizable. In a discussion littered with entirely vague statements from the legislative history, cf. &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 674-675, the United States argues that Congress presumably wanted independent contractors with private entities covered under Title III because independent contractors with governmental entities are covered by Title II, see Brief for United States as &lt;i&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 18, and n. 17&#151;a line of reasoning &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*695&lt;/span&gt; that does not commend itself to the untutored intellect. But since the United States does not provide (and I cannot conceive of) any possible construction of the &lt;i&gt;terms&lt;/i&gt; of Title III that will exclude employees while simultaneously covering independent contractors, its concession regarding employees effectively concedes independent contractors as well. Title III applies only to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court, for its part, assumes that conclusion for the sake of argument, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 679-680, but pronounces respondent to be a "customer" of the PGA TOUR or of the golf courses on which it is played. That seems to me quite incredible. The PGA TOUR is a professional sporting event, staged for the entertainment of a live and TV audience, the receipts from whom (the TV audience's admission price is paid by advertisers) pay the expenses of the tour, including the cash prizes for the winning golfers. The professional golfers on the tour are no more "enjoying" (the statutory term) the entertainment that the tour provides, or the facilities of the golf courses on which it is held, than professional baseball players "enjoy" the baseball games in which they play or the facilities of Yankee Stadium. To be sure, professional ballplayers &lt;i&gt;participate&lt;/i&gt; in the games, and &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; the ballfields, but no one in his right mind would think that they are &lt;i&gt;customers&lt;/i&gt; of the American League or of Yankee Stadium. They are themselves the entertainment that the customers pay to watch. And professional golfers are no different. It makes not a bit of difference, insofar as their "customer" status is concerned, that the remuneration for their performance (unlike most of the remuneration for ballplayers) is not fixed but contingent&#151;viz., the purses for the winners in the various events, and the compensation from product endorsements that consistent winners are assured. The compensation of &lt;i&gt;many&lt;/i&gt; independent contractors is contingent upon their success&#151;real estate brokers, for example, or insurance salesmen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*696&lt;/span&gt; As the Court points out, the ADA specifically identifies golf courses as one of the covered places of public accommodation. See &#167; 12181(7)(L) ("a gymnasium, health spa, bowling alley, golf course, or other place of exercise or recreation"); and the distinctive "goo[d], servic[e], facilit[y], privileg[e], advantag[e], or accommodatio[n]" identified by that provision as distinctive to that category of place of public accommodation is "exercise or recreation." Respondent did not seek to "exercise" or "recreate" at the PGA TOUR events; he sought to make money (which is why he is called a &lt;i&gt;professional&lt;/i&gt; golfer). He was not a customer &lt;i&gt;buying&lt;/i&gt; recreation or entertainment; he was a professional athlete &lt;i&gt;selling&lt;/i&gt;  it. That is the reason (among others) the Court's reliance upon Civil Rights Act cases like &lt;i&gt;Daniel&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Paul,&lt;/i&gt; 395 U. S. 298 (1969), see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 681, is misplaced. A professional golfer's practicing his profession is not comparable to John Q. Public's frequenting "a 232-acre amusement area with swimming, boating, sun bathing, picnicking, miniature golf, dancing facilities, and a snack bar." &lt;i&gt;Daniel, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 301.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court relies heavily upon the Q-School. It says that petitioner offers the golfing public the "privilege" of "competing in the Q-School and playing in the tours; indeed, the former is a privilege for which thousands of individuals from the general public pay, and the latter is one for which they vie." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 677. But the Q-School is no more a "privilege" offered for the general public's "enjoyment" than is the California Bar Exam.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; It is a competition for entry into the PGA TOUR&#151;an open tryout, no different in principle from open casting for a movie or stage production, or walk-on tryouts &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*697&lt;/span&gt; for other professional sports, such as baseball. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Amateurs Join Pros for New Season of HBO's "Sopranos," Detroit News, Dec. 22, 2000, p. 2 (20,000 attend open casting for "The Sopranos"); Bill Zack, Atlanta Braves, Sporting News, Feb. 6, 1995 (1,300 would-be players attended an open tryout for the Atlanta Braves). It may well be that some amateur golfers enjoy trying to make the grade, just as some amateur actors may enjoy auditions, and amateur baseball players may enjoy open tryouts (I hesitate to say that amateur lawyers may enjoy taking the California Bar Exam). But the purpose of holding those tryouts is not to provide entertainment; it is to hire. At bottom, open tryouts for performances to be held at a place of public accommodation are no different from open bidding on contracts to cut the grass at a place of public accommodation, or open applications for any job at a place of public accommodation. Those bidding, those applying&#151;and those trying out&#151;are not converted into customers. By the Court's reasoning, a business exists not only to sell goods and services to the public, but to provide the "privilege" of employment to the public; wherefore it follows, like night the day, that everyone who seeks a job is a customer.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*698&lt;/span&gt; II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having erroneously held that Title III applies to the "customers" of professional golf who consist of its practitioners, the Court then erroneously answers&#151;or to be accurate simply ignores&#151;a second question. The ADA requires covered businesses to make such reasonable modifications of "policies, practices, or procedures" as are necessary to "afford" goods, services, and privileges to individuals with disabilities; but it explicitly does not require "modifications [that] would fundamentally alter the nature" of the goods, services, and privileges. &#167; 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii). In other words, disabled individuals must be given &lt;i&gt;access&lt;/i&gt; to the same goods, services, and privileges that others enjoy. The regulations state that Title III "does not require a public accommodation to alter its inventory to include accessible or special goods with accessibility features that are designed for, or facilitate use by, individuals with disabilities." 28 CFR &#167; 36.307 (2000); see also 28 CFR, ch. 1, pt. 36, App. B, at 650. As one Court of Appeals has explained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The common sense of the statute is that the content of the goods or services offered by a place of public accommodation is not regulated. A camera store may not refuse to sell cameras to a disabled person, but it is not required to stock cameras specially designed for such persons. Had Congress purposed to impose so enormous a burden on the retail sector of the economy and so vast a supervisory responsibility on the federal courts, we think it would have made its intention clearer and would at least have imposed some standards. It is hardly a feasible judicial function to decide whether shoestores should sell single shoes to one-legged persons and if so at what price, or how many Braille books the Borders or Barnes and Noble bookstore chains should stock in each of their stores." &lt;i&gt;Doe&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Mutual of Omaha&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 179 F. 3d 557, 560 (CA7 1999).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*699&lt;/span&gt; Since this is so, even if respondent here is a consumer of the "privilege" of the PGA TOUR competition, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 677, I see no basis for considering whether the rules of that competition must be altered. It is as irrelevant to the PGA TOUR's compliance with the statute whether walking is essential to the game of golf as it is to the shoe store's compliance whether "pairness" is essential to the nature of shoes. If a shoe store wishes to sell shoes only in pairs it may; and if a golf tour (or a golf course) wishes to provide only walkaround golf, it may. The PGA TOUR cannot deny respondent &lt;i&gt;access&lt;/i&gt; to that game because of his disability, but it need not provide him a game different (whether in its essentials or in its details) from that offered to everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it has held (or assumed) professional golfers to be customers "enjoying" the "privilege" that consists of PGA TOUR golf; and since it inexplicably regards the rules of PGA TOUR golf as merely "policies, practices, or procedures" by which access to PGA TOUR golf is provided, the Court must then confront the question whether respondent's requested modification of the supposed policy, practice, or procedure of walking would "fundamentally alter the nature" of the PGA TOUR game, &#167; 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii). The Court attacks this "fundamental alteration" analysis by asking two questions: first, whether the "essence" or an "essential aspect" of the sport of golf has been altered; and second, whether the change, even if not essential to the game, would give the disabled player an advantage over others and thereby "fundamentally alter the character of the competition." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 683. It answers no to both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before considering the Court's answer to the first question, it is worth pointing out that the assumption which underlies that question is false. Nowhere is it writ that PGA TOUR golf must be classic "essential" golf. Why cannot the PGA TOUR, if it wishes, promote a new game, with distinctive rules (much as the American League promotes a game of baseball in which the pitcher's turn at the plate can be &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*700&lt;/span&gt; taken by a "designated hitter")? If members of the public do not like the new rules&#151;if they feel that these rules do not truly test the individual's skill at "real golf" (or the team's skill at "real baseball") they can withdraw their patronage. But the rules are the rules. They are (as in all games) entirely arbitrary, and there is no basis on which anyone&#151;not even the Supreme Court of the United States&#151;can pronounce one or another of them to be "nonessential" if the rulemaker (here the PGA TOUR) deems it to be essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one assumes, however, that the PGA TOUR has some legal obligation to play classic, Platonic golf&#151;and if one assumes the correctness of all the other wrong turns the Court has made to get to this point&#151;then we Justices must confront what is indeed an awesome responsibility. It has been rendered the solemn duty of the Supreme Court of the United States, laid upon it by Congress in pursuance of the Federal Government's power "[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States," U. S. Const., Art. I,&#167; 8, cl. 3, to decide What Is Golf. I am sure that the Framers of the Constitution, aware of the 1457 edict of King James II of Scotland prohibiting golf because it interfered with the practice of archery, fully expected that sooner or later the paths of golf and government, the law and the links, would once again cross, and that the judges of this august Court would some day have to wrestle with that age-old jurisprudential question, for which their years of study in the law have so well prepared them: Is someone riding around a golf course from shot to shot &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; a golfer? The answer, we learn, is yes. The Court ultimately concludes, and it will henceforth be the Law of the Land, that walking is not a "fundamental" aspect of golf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either out of humility or out of self-respect (one or the other) the Court should decline to answer this incredibly difficult and incredibly silly question. To say that something is "essential" is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object. But since it is the very &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*701&lt;/span&gt; nature of a game to have no object except amusement (that is what distinguishes games from productive activity), it is quite impossible to say that any of a game's arbitrary rules is "essential." Eighteen-hole golf courses, 10-foot-high basketball hoops, 90-foot baselines, 100-yard football fields&#151;all are arbitrary and none is essential. The only support for any of them is tradition and (in more modern times) insistence by what has come to be regarded as the ruling body of the sport&#151;both of which factors support the PGA TOUR's position in the present case. (Many, indeed, consider walking to be &lt;i&gt;the central feature&lt;/i&gt; of the game of golf&#151;hence Mark Twain's classic criticism of the sport: "a good walk spoiled.") I suppose there is some point at which the rules of a wellknown game are changed to such a degree that no reasonable person would call it the same game. If the PGA TOUR competitors were required to dribble a large, inflated ball and put it through a round hoop, the game could no longer reasonably be called golf. But this criterion&#151;destroying recognizability as the same generic game&#151;is surely not the test of "essentialness" or "fundamentalness" that the Court applies, since it apparently thinks that merely changing the diameter of the &lt;i&gt;cup&lt;/i&gt; might "fundamentally alter" the game of golf, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 682.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having concluded that dispensing with the walking rule would not violate federal-Platonic "golf" (and, implicitly, that it is federal-Platonic golf, and no other, that the PGA TOUR can insist upon), the Court moves on to the second part of its test: the competitive effects of waiving this nonessential rule. In this part of its analysis, the Court first finds that the effects of the change are "mitigated" by the fact that in the game of golf weather, a "lucky bounce," and "pure chance" provide different conditions for each competitor and individual ability may not "be the sole determinant of the outcome." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 687. I guess that is why those who follow professional golfing consider Jack Nicklaus the &lt;i&gt;luckiest&lt;/i&gt; golfer of all time, only to be challenged of late by &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*702&lt;/span&gt; the phenomenal &lt;i&gt;luck&lt;/i&gt; of Tiger Woods. The Court's empiricism is unpersuasive. "Pure chance" is randomly distributed among the players, but allowing respondent to use a cart gives him a "lucky" break every time he plays. Pure chance also only matters at the margin&#151;a stroke here or there; the cart substantially improves this respondent's competitive prospects beyond a couple of strokes. But even granting that there are significant nonhuman variables affecting competition, that fact does not justify adding another variable that always favors one player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an apparent effort to make its opinion as narrow as possible, the Court relies upon the District Court's finding that even with a cart, respondent will be at least as fatigued as everyone else. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 690. This, the Court says, &lt;i&gt;proves&lt;/i&gt;  that competition will not be affected. Far from thinking that reliance on this finding cabins the effect of today's opinion, I think it will prove to be its most expansive and destructive feature. Because step one of the Court's two-part inquiry into whether a requested change in a sport will "fundamentally alter [its] nature," &#167; 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), consists of an utterly unprincipled ontology of sports (pursuant to which the Court is not even sure whether golf's "essence" requires a 3-inch hole), there is every reason to think that in future cases involving requests for special treatment by would-be athletes the second step of the analysis will be determinative. In resolving that second step&#151;determining whether waiver of the "nonessential" rule will have an impermissible "competitive effect"&#151;by measuring the athletic capacity of the requesting individual, and asking whether the special dispensation would do no more than place him on a par (so to speak) with other competitors, the Court guarantees that future cases of this sort will have to be decided on the basis of individualized factual findings. Which means that future cases of this sort will be numerous, and a rich source of lucrative litigation. One can envision the parents of a Little &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*703&lt;/span&gt; League player with attention deficit disorder trying to convince a judge that their son's disability makes it at least 25% more difficult to hit a pitched ball. (If they are successful, the only thing that could prevent a court order giving the kid four strikes would be a judicial determination that, in baseball, three strikes are metaphysically necessary, which is quite absurd.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statute, of course, provides no basis for this individualized analysis that is the Court's last step on a long and misguided journey. The statute seeks to assure that a disabled person's disability will not deny him &lt;i&gt;equal access&lt;/i&gt; to (among other things) competitive sporting events&#151;not that his disability will not deny him an &lt;i&gt;equal chance to win&lt;/i&gt; competitive sporting events. The latter is quite impossible, since the very &lt;i&gt;nature&lt;/i&gt; of competitive sport is the measurement, by uniform rules, of unevenly distributed excellence. This unequal distribution is precisely what determines the winners and losers&#151;and artificially to "even out" that distribution, by giving one or another player exemption from a rule that emphasizes his particular weakness, is to destroy the game. That is why the "handicaps" that are customary in social games of golf&#151;which, by adding strokes to the scores of the good players and subtracting them from scores of the bad ones, "even out" the varying abilities&#151;are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;  used in professional golf. In the Court's world, there is one set of rules that is "fair with respect to the able-bodied" but "individualized" rules, mandated by the ADA, for "talented but disabled athletes." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 691. The ADA mandates no such ridiculous thing. Agility, strength, speed, balance, quickness of mind, steadiness of nerves, intensity of concentration&#151;these talents are not evenly distributed. No wildeyed dreamer has ever suggested that the managing bodies of the competitive sports that test precisely these qualities should try to take account of the uneven distribution of Godgiven &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*704&lt;/span&gt; gifts when writing and enforcing the rules of competition. And I have no doubt Congress did not authorize misty-eyed judicial supervision of such a revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My belief that today's judgment is clearly in error should not be mistaken for a belief that the PGA TOUR clearly &lt;i&gt;ought not&lt;/i&gt; allow respondent to use a golf cart. &lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; is a close question, on which even those who compete in the PGA TOUR are apparently divided; but it is a &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; question from the one before the Court. Just as it is a different question whether the Little League &lt;i&gt;ought&lt;/i&gt; to give disabled youngsters a fourth strike, or some other waiver from the rules that makes up for their disabilities. In both cases, whether they &lt;i&gt;ought&lt;/i&gt; to do so depends upon (1) how central to the game that they have organized (and over whose rules they are the master) they deem the waived provision to be, and (2) how competitive&#151;how strict a test of raw athletic ability in all aspects of the competition&#151;they want their game to be. But whether Congress has said they &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; do so depends upon the answers to the legal questions I have discussed above&#151;not upon what this Court sententiously decrees to be "`decent, tolerant, [and] progressive,' " &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 675 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Garrett,&lt;/i&gt; 531 U. S. 356, 375 (2001) (Kennedy, J., concurring)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it should not be assumed that today's decent, tolerant, and progressive judgment will, in the long run, accrue to the benefit of sports competitors with disabilities. Now that it is clear courts will review the rules of sports for "fundamentalness," organizations that value their autonomy have every incentive to defend vigorously the necessity of every regulation. They may still be second-guessed in the end as to the Platonic requirements of the sport, but they will &lt;i&gt;assuredly&lt;/i&gt;  lose if they have at all wavered in their enforcement. The lesson the PGA TOUR and other sports organizations should take from this case is to make sure that the same written &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*705&lt;/span&gt; rules are set forth for all levels of play, and never voluntarily to grant any modifications. The second lesson is to end open tryouts. I doubt that, in the long run, even disabled athletes will be well served by these incentives that the Court has created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complaints about this case are not "properly directed to Congress," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 689, n. 51. They are properly directed to this Court's Kafkaesque determination that professional sports organizations, and the fields they rent for their exhibitions, are "places of public accommodation" to the competing athletes, and the athletes themselves "customers" of the organization that pays them; its Alice in Wonderland determination that there are such things as judicially determinable "essential" and "nonessential" rules of a made-up game; and its Animal Farm determination that fairness and the ADA mean that everyone gets to play by individualized rules which will assure that no one's lack of ability (or at least no one's lack of ability so pronounced that it amounts to a disability) will be a handicap. The year was 2001, and "everybody was finally equal." K. Vonnegut, Harrison Bergeron, in Animal Farm and Related Readings 129 (1997).&lt;/p&gt;

The NIKE TOUR hard card similarly requires walking unless otherwise permitted. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 129. Additionally, as noted, golf carts have not been permitted during the third stage of the Q-School since 1997.

&lt;p&gt;[7]  Title 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12102 provides, in part:

&lt;p&gt;"The term `disability' means, with respect to an individual&#151;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[9]  When asked about the other teams' reaction to Martin's use of a cart, the Stanford coach testified:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Q. Was there any complaint ever made to you by the coaches when he was allowed a cart that that gave a competitive advantage over the&#151;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A. Any complaints? No sir, there were exactly&#151;exactly the opposite. Everybody recognized Casey for the person he was, and what he was doing with his life, and every coach, to my knowledge, and every player wanted Casey in the tournament and they welcomed him there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Q. Did anyone contend that that constituted an alteration of the competition to the extent that it didn't constitute the game to your level, the college level?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A. Not at all, sir." App. 208.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[10]  Title 42 U. S. C.&#167; 12187 provides: "The provisions of this subchapter shall not apply to private clubs or establishments exempted from coverage under Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U. S.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A. Oh, it is.And it has happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Q. Does this fatigue factor that you've talked about, Mr. Venturi, affect the manner in which you&#151;you perform as a professional out on the golf course?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A. Oh, there's no doubt, again, but that, that fatigue does play a big part. It will influence your game. It will influence your shot-making. It will influence your decisions." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 236-237.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[16]  "Q.Based on your experience, do you believe that it would fundamentally alter the nature of the competition on the PGA Tour and the Nike Tour if competitors in those events were permitted to use golf carts?

&lt;p&gt;"A. Yes, absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Q. Why do you say so, sir?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A. It would&#151;it would take away the fatigue factor in many ways. It would&#151;it would change the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Q. Now, when you say that the use of carts takes away the fatigue factor, it would be an aid, et cetera, again, as I understand it, you are not testifying now about the plaintiff. You are just talking in general terms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A. Yes, sir." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 238. See also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 177-178 (Palmer); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 191 (Nicklaus).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[17]  "In the first place, he does walk while on the course&#151;even with a cart, he must move from cart to shot and back to the cart. In essence, he still must walk approximately 25% of the course. On a course roughly five miles in length, Martin will walk 120444 miles." 994 F. Supp., at 1251.
1 The California Bar Exam is covered by the ADA, by the way, because a separate provision of Title III applies to "examinations . . .related to applications, licensing, certification, or credentialing for secondary or post-secondary education, professional, or trade purposes." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12189. If open tryouts were "privileges" under &#167; 12182, and participants in the tryouts "customers," &#167; 12189 would have been unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[18]  It explained: "For example, Title III includes in its definition `secondary, undergraduate, or post-graduate private school[s].' 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12181(7)(J). The competition to enter the most elite private universities is intense, and a relatively select few are admitted.

&lt;p&gt;[26]  Reply Brief for Petitioner 1-2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[27]  Martin complains that petitioner's failure to make this exact argument below precludes its assertion here.However, the Title III coverage issue was raised in the lower courts, petitioner advanced this particular argument in support of its position on the issue in its petition for certiorari, and the argument was fully briefed on the merits by both parties.Given the importance of the issue, we exercise our discretion to consider it.See &lt;i&gt;Harris Trust and Sav. Bank&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Salomon Smith Barney Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 530 U. S. 238, 245-246, n. 2 (2000); &lt;i&gt;Carlson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Green,&lt;/i&gt; 446 U. S. 14, 17, n. 2 (1980).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[28]  Brief for Petitioner 10, 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[29]  &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 19 (quoting 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12182(b)(1)(A)(iv)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[30]  Brief for Petitioner 15; see also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 16 (Martin's claim "is nothing more than a straightforward discrimination-in-the-workplacecomplaint").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[31]  Clause (i) prohibits the denial of participation, clause (ii) participation in unequal benefits, and clause (iii) the provision of separate benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[32]  Brief for Petitioner 20 (clause (iv) "applies directly just to subsection 12182(b)"); Reply Brief for Petitioner 4, n. 1 (clause (iv) "does not apply directly to the general provision prohibiting discrimination").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[33]  Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, our view of the Q-School does not make "everyone who seeks a job" at a public accommodation, through "an open tryout" or otherwise, "a customer." &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 697 (opinion of Scalia, J.). Unlike those who successfully apply for a job at a place of public accommodation, or those who successfully bid for a contract, the golfers who qualify for petitioner's tours play at their own pleasure (perhaps, but not necessarily, for prize money), and although they commit to playing in at least 15 tournaments, they are not bound by any obligations typically associated with employment. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; App. 260 (trial testimony of PGA commissioner Timothy Finchem) (petitioner lacks control over when and where tour members compete, and over their manner of performance outside the rules of competition). Furthermore, unlike athletes in "other professional sports, such as baseball," &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 697, in which players are employed by their clubs, the golfers on tour are not employed by petitioner or any related organizations. The record does not support the proposition that the purpose of the Q-School "is to hire," &lt;i&gt;ibid.,&lt;/i&gt; rather than to narrow the field of participants in the sporting events that petitioner sponsors at places of public accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[34]  Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 includes in its definition of "public accommodation" a "place of exhibition or entertainment" but does not specifically list a "golf course" as an example.See 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000a(b).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[35]  Under petitioner's theory, Title II would not preclude it from discriminating against golfers on racial grounds.App. 197; Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[36]  Cf. &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 701 (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("I suppose there is some point at which the rules of a well-known game are changed to such a degree that no reasonable person would call it the same game").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[37]  Accord, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 703 (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("The statute seeks to assure that a disabled person's disability will not deny him &lt;i&gt;equal access&lt;/i&gt; to (among other things) competitive sporting events&#151;not that his disability will not deny him an &lt;i&gt;equal chance to win&lt;/i&gt; competitive sporting events").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[38]  As we have noted, the statute contemplates three inquiries: whether the requested modification is "reasonable," whether it is "necessary" for the disabled individual, and whether it would "fundamentally alter the nature of" the competition. 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii). Whether one question should be decided before the others likely will vary from case to case, for in logic there seems to be no necessary priority among the three. In routine cases, the fundamental alteration inquiry may end with the question whether a rule is essential. Alternatively, the specifics of the claimed disability might be examined within the context of what is a reasonable or necessary modification. Given the concession by petitioner that the modification sought is reasonable and necessary, and given petitioner's reliance on the fundamental alteration provision, we have no occasion to consider the alternatives in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[39]  Golf is an ancient game, tracing its ancestry to Scotland, and played by such no tables as Mary Queen of Scots and her son James. That shotmaking has been the essence of golf since early in its history is reflected in the first recorded rules of golf, published in 1744 for a tournament on the Leith Links in Edinburgh:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Articles &amp;amp; Laws in Playing at Golf&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"1. You must Tee your Ball, within a Club's length of the [previous] Hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"2. Your Tee must be upon the Ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[42]  On this point, the testimony of the immediate past president of the USGA (and one of petitioner's witnesses at trial) is illuminating:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Tell the court, if you would, Ms. Bell, who it is that plays under these Rules of Golf . . . ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A. Well, these are the rules of the game, so all golfers. These are for all people who play the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Q. So the two amateurs that go out on the weekend to play golf together would&#151;would play by the Rules of Golf?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A. We certainly hope so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Q. Or a tournament that is conducted at a private country club for its members, is it your understanding that that would typically be conducted under the Rules of Golf?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A. Well, that's&#151;that's right. If you want to play golf, you need to play by these rules." App. 239.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[43]  See n. 3, &lt;i&gt;supra.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[44]  Furthermore, the USGA's handicap system, used by over 4 million amateur golfers playing on courses rated by the USGA, does not consider whether a player walks or rides in a cart, or whether she uses a caddy or carries her own clubs. Rather, a player's handicap is determined by a formula that takes into account the average score in the 10 best of her 20 most recent rounds, the difficulty of the different courses played, and whether or not a round was a "tournament" event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[48]  A drive by Andrew Magee earlier this year produced a result that he neither intended nor expected. While the foursome ahead of him was still on the green, he teed off on a 322-yard par four. To his surprise, the ball not only reached the green, but also bounced off Tom Byrum's putter and into the hole. Davis, Magee Gets Ace on Par-4, Ariz. Republic, Jan. 26, 2001, p. C16, 2001 WL 8510792.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[49]  That has been so not only in the SENIOR PGA TOUR and the first two stages of the Q-School, but also, as Martin himself noticed, in the third stage of the Q-School after petitioner permitted everyone to ride rather than just waiving the walking rule for Martin as required by the District Court's injunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[50]  App. 201. See also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 179-180 (deposition testimony of Gerry Norquist); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 225-226 (trial testimony of Harry Toscano).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[51]  Hence, petitioner's questioning of the ability of courts to apply the reasonable modification requirement to athletic competition is a complaint more properly directed to Congress, which drafted the ADA's coverage broadly, than to us. Even more misguided is Justice Scalia's suggestion that Congress did not place that inquiry into the hands of the courts at all. According to the dissent, the game of golf as sponsored by petitioner is, like all sports games, the sum of its "arbitrary rules," and no one, including courts, "can pronounce one or another of them to be `nonessential' if the rulemaker (here the PGA TOUR) deems it to be essential." &lt;i&gt;Post,&lt;/i&gt; at 700. Whatever the merit of Justice Scalia's postmodern view of "What Is [Sport]," &lt;i&gt;ibid.,&lt;/i&gt; it is clear that Congress did not enshrine it in Title III of the ADA. While Congress expressly exempted "private clubs or establishments" and "religious organizations or entities" from Title III's coverage, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 12187, Congress made no such exception for athletic competitions, much less did it give sports organizations &lt;i&gt;carte blanche&lt;/i&gt; authority to exempt themselves from the fundamental alteration inquiry by deeming any rule, no matter how peripheral to the competition, to be essential. In short, Justice Scalia's reading of the statute renders the word "fundamentally" largely superfluous, because it treats the alteration of any rule governing an event at a public accommodation to be a fundamental alteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[52]  On this fundamental point, the dissent agrees. See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 699 ("The PGA TOUR cannot deny respondent &lt;i&gt;access&lt;/i&gt; to that game because of his disability").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[53]  However, we think petitioner's contention that the task of assessing requests for modifications will amount to a substantial burden is overstated. As Martin indicates, in the three years since he requested the use of a cart, no one else has sued the PGA, and only two other golfers (one of whom is Olinger) have sued the USGA for a waiver of the walking rule. In addition, we believe petitioner's point is misplaced, as nowhere in &#167; 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii) does Congress limit the reasonable modification requirement only to requests that are easy to evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The Court suggests that respondent is not an independent contractor because he "play[s] at [his] own pleasure," and is not subject to PGA TOUR control "over [his] manner of performance," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 680, n. 33. But many independent contractors&#151;composers of movie music, portrait artists, script writers, and even (some would say) plumbers&#151;retain at least as much control over when and how they work as does respondent, who agrees to play in a minimum of 15 of the designated PGA TOUR events, and to play by the rules that the PGA TOUR specifies. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Community for Creative Non-Violence&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Reid,&lt;/i&gt; 490 U. S. 730, 751-753 (1989) (discussing independent contractor status of a sculptor). Moreover, although, as the Court suggests in the same footnote, in rare cases a PGA TOUR winner will choose to forgo the prize money (in order, for example, to preserve amateur status necessary for continuing participation in college play) he is contractually &lt;i&gt;entitled&lt;/i&gt; to the prize money if he demands it, which is all that a contractual relationship requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Michael W. Hawkins&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent Kentucky River Community Care, Inc. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Louise S. Brock&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cheryl E. Bruner.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Scalia, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the National Labor Relations Act, employees are deemed to be "supervisors" and thereby excluded from the protections of the Act if, &lt;i&gt;inter alia,&lt;/i&gt; they exercise "independent judgment" in "responsibly . . . direct[ing]" other employees "in the interest of the employer." 29 U. S. C. &#167; 152(11). This case presents two questions: which party in an unfair-labor-practice proceeding bears the burden of proving or disproving an employee's supervisory status; and whether judgment is not "independent judgment" to the extent that it is informed by professional or technical training or experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pippa Passes, Kentucky, respondent Kentucky River Community Care, Inc., operates a care facility for residents who suffer from mental retardation and mental illness. The facility, named the Caney Creek Developmental Complex (Caney Creek), employs approximately 110 professional and nonprofessional employees in addition to roughly a dozen concededly managerial or supervisory employees. In 1997, the Kentucky State District Council of Carpenters (a labor &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*709&lt;/span&gt; union that is co-respondent here, supporting petitioner) petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to represent a single unit of all 110 potentially eligible employees at Caney Creek. See National Labor Relations Act (Act) &#167; 9(c), 49 Stat. 453, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 159(c).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the ensuing representation hearing, respondent objected to the inclusion of Caney Creek's six registered nurses in the bargaining unit, arguing that they were "supervisors" under &#167; 2(11) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 152(11), and therefore excluded from the class of "employees" subject to the Act's protection and includable in the bargaining unit. See &#167; 2(3), 29 U. S. C. &#167; 152(3). The Board's Regional Director, to whom the Board has delegated its initial authority to determine an appropriate bargaining unit, see &#167; 3(b), 29 U. S. C. &#167; 153(b); 29 CFR &#167; 101.21 (2000), placed the burden of proving supervisory status on respondent, found that respondent had not carried its burden, and therefore included the nurses in the bargaining unit. The Regional Director accordingly directed an election to determine whether the union would represent the unit. See &#167; 9(c)(1), 29 U. S. C. &#167; 159(c)(1). The Board denied respondent's request for review of the Regional Director's decision and direction of election, and the union won the election and was certified as the representative of the Caney Creek employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because direct judicial review of representation determinations is unavailable, &lt;i&gt;AFL&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;NLRB,&lt;/i&gt; 308 U. S. 401, 409-411 (1940), respondent sought indirect review by refusing to bargain with the union, thereby inducing the General Counsel of the Board to file an unfair labor practice complaint under &#167;&#167; 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(5) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. &#167;&#167; 158(a)(1), (5). The Board granted summary judgment to the General Counsel pursuant to regulations providing that, absent newly developed evidence, the propriety of a bargaining unit may not be relitigated in an unfair labor practice hearing predicated on a challenge to the representation determination. 29 CFR &#167; 102.67(f) (2000); see &lt;i&gt;Magnesium Casting Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*710&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;NLRB,&lt;/i&gt; 401 U. S. 137, 139-141 (1971) (approving that practice); &lt;i&gt;Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;NLRB,&lt;/i&gt; 313 U. S. 146, 161-162 (1941) (same).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent petitioned for review of the Board's decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, and the Board cross-petitioned. The Sixth Circuit granted respondent's petition as it applied to the nurses and refused to enforce the bargaining order. It held that the Board had erred in placing the burden of proving supervisory status on respondent rather than on its General Counsel, and it rejected the Board's interpretation of "independent judgment," explaining that the Board had erred by classifying "the practice of a nurse supervising a nurse's aide in administering patient care" as "`routine' [simply] because the nurses have the ability to direct patient care by virtue of their training and expertise, not because of their connection with `management.' " 193 F. 3d 444, 453 (1999). We granted the Board's petition for a writ of certiorari. 530 U. S. 1304 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Act expressly defines the term "supervisor" in &#167; 2(11), which provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The term `supervisor' means any individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment." 29 U. S. C. &#167; 152(11).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Act does not, however, expressly allocate the burden of proving or disproving a challenged employee's supervisory status. The Board therefore has filled the statutory gap with the consistent rule that the burden is borne by &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*711&lt;/span&gt; the party claiming that the employee is a supervisor. For example, when the General Counsel seeks to attribute the conduct of certain employees to the employer by virtue of their supervisory status, this rule dictates that he bear the burden of proving supervisory status. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., Masterform Tool Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 327 N. L. R. B. 1071, 1071-1072 (1999). Or, when a union challenges certain ballots cast in a representation election on the basis that they were cast by supervisors, the union bears the burden. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Panaro and Grimes,&lt;/i&gt; 321 N. L. R. B. 811, 812 (1996).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board argues that the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit erred in not deferring to its resolution of the statutory ambiguity, and we agree. The Board's rule is supported by "the general rule of statutory construction that the burden of proving justification or exemption under a special exception to the prohibitions of a statute generally rests on one who claims its benefits." &lt;i&gt;FTC&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Morton Salt Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 334 U. S. 37, 44-45 (1948). The Act's definition of "employee," &#167; 2(3), 29 U. S. C. &#167; 152(3), "reiterate[s] the breadth of the ordinary dictionary definition" of that term, so that it includes "any `person who works for another in return for financial or other compensation.' " &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Town &amp;amp; Country Elec., Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 516 U. S. 85, 90 (1995) (quoting American Heritage Dictionary 604 (3d ed. 1992)). Supervisors would fall within the class of employees, were they not expressly excepted from it. See &lt;i&gt;Sure-Tan, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;NLRB,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 883, 891 (1984); cf. &lt;i&gt;Packard Motor Car Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;NLRB,&lt;/i&gt; 330 U. S. 485 (1947). The burden of proving the applicability of the supervisory exception, under &lt;i&gt;Morton Salt,&lt;/i&gt; should thus fall on the party asserting it. In addition, it is easier to prove an employee's authority to exercise 1 of the 12 listed supervisory functions than to disprove an employee's authority to exercise any of those functions, and practicality therefore favors placing the burden on the party asserting supervisory status. We find that the Board's rule for allocating the burden of proof is reasonable and consistent with the Act, and &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*712&lt;/span&gt; we therefore defer to it. &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Transportation Management Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 462 U. S. 393, 402-403 (1983).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying its rule to this case, the Board placed on respondent the duty to prove the supervisory status of its nurses both in the &#167; 9(c) representation proceeding, where respondent sought to exclude the nurses from the bargaining unit prior to the election, and in the unfair labor practice hearing, where respondent defended against the &#167; 8(a)(5) refusal-to-bargain charge. Respondent challenges the application of the rule to the latter proceeding where, it correctly observes and the Board does not dispute, "the General Counsel carries the burden of proving the elements of an unfair labor practice," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 401, which means that it bears the burden of persuasion as well as of production, see Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. &#167; 556(d); &lt;i&gt;Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Greenwich Collieries,&lt;/i&gt; 512 U. S. 267, 276-278 (1994) (rejecting statement to contrary in &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Transportation Management Corp., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 404, n. 7). Supervisory status, however, is not an element of the Board's claim in this setting. The Board must prove that the employer refused to bargain with the representative of a unit of "employees," &#167; 8(a)(5), 29 U. S. C. &#167; 158(a)(5), that was properly certified; the unit was not properly certified (as the respondent contends) only if the respondent successfully demonstrated, at the certification stage, that some employees in the unit were also supervisors. In the unfair labor practice proceeding, therefore, the burden remains on the employer to establish the excepted status of these nurses. Insofar as the Court of Appeals held otherwise, it erred. It remains to consider whether the court's other holding that is challenged here suffices to sustain its judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text of &#167; 2(11) of the Act that we quoted above, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 152(11), sets forth a three-part test for determining &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*713&lt;/span&gt; supervisory status. Employees are statutory supervisors if (1) they hold the authority to engage in any 1 of the 12 listed supervisory functions, (2) their "exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment," and (3) their authority is held "in the interest of the employer." &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Health Care &amp;amp; Retirement Corp. of America,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S. 571, 573-574 (1994). The only basis asserted by the Board, before the Court of Appeals and here, for rejecting respondent's proof of supervisory status with respect to directing patient care was the Board's interpretation of the second part of the test&#151;to wit, that employees do not use "independent judgment" when they exercise "ordinary professional or technical judgment in directing less-skilled employees to deliver services in accordance with employerspecified standards." Brief for Petitioner 11. The Court of Appeals rejected that interpretation, and so do we.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two aspects of the Board's interpretation are reasonable, and hence controlling on this Court, see &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Town &amp;amp; Country Elec., Inc., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 89-90; &lt;i&gt;Chevron U. S. A. Inc.&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 837, 842-844 (1984). First, it is certainly true that the statutory term "independent judgment" is ambiguous with respect to the &lt;i&gt;degree&lt;/i&gt; of discretion required for supervisory status. See &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Health Care &amp;amp; Retirement Corp. of America, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 579. Many nominally supervisory functions may be performed without the "exercis[e of] such a degree of . . . judgment or discretion . . . as would warrant a finding" of supervisory status under the Act. &lt;i&gt;Weyerhaeuser Timber Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 85 N. L. R. B. 1170, 1173 (1949). It falls clearly within the Board's discretion to determine, within reason, what scope of discretion qualifies. Second, as reflected in the Board's phrase "in accordance with employer-specified standards," it is also undoubtedly true that the degree of judgment that might ordinarily be required to conduct a particular task may be reduced below the statutory threshold &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*714&lt;/span&gt; by detailed orders and regulations issued by the employer. So, for example, in &lt;i&gt;Chevron Shipping Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 317 N. L. R. B. 379, 381 (1995), the Board concluded that "although the contested licensed officers are imbued with a great deal of responsibility, their use of independent judgment and discretion is circumscribed by the master's standing orders, and the Operating Regulations, which require the watch officer to contact a superior officer when anything unusual occurs or when problems occur."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board, however, argues further that the judgment even of employees who are permitted by their employer to exercise a sufficient &lt;i&gt;degree&lt;/i&gt; of discretion is not "independent judgment" if it is a particular &lt;i&gt;kind&lt;/i&gt; of judgment, namely, "ordinary professional or technical judgment in directing less-skilled employees to deliver services." Brief for Petitioner 11. The first five words of this interpretation insert a startling categorical exclusion into statutory text that does not suggest its existence. The text, by focusing on the "clerical" or "routine" (as opposed to "independent") nature of the judgment, introduces the question of degree of judgment that we have agreed falls within the reasonable discretion of the Board to resolve. But the Board's categorical exclusion turns on factors that have nothing to do with the degree of discretion an employee exercises. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Whitman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Trucking Assns., Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 531 U. S. 457, 481 (2001) ("[T]he agency's interpretation goes beyond the limits of what is ambiguous and contradicts what in our view is quite clear"). Let the judgment be significant and only loosely constrained by the employer; if it is "professional or technical" it will nonetheless not be independent.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The breadth &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*715&lt;/span&gt; of this exclusion is made all the more startling by virtue of the Board's extension of it to judgment based on greater "experience" as well as formal training. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 3 ("professional or technical skill or experience"). What supervisory judgment worth exercising, one must wonder, does not rest on "professional or technical skill or experience"? If the Board applied this aspect of its test to every exercise of a supervisory function, it would virtually eliminate "supervisors" from the Act. Cf. &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Yeshiva Univ.,&lt;/i&gt; 444 U. S. 672, 687 (1980) (Excluding "decisions . . . based on . . . professional expertise" would risk "the indiscriminate recharacterization as covered employees of professionals working in supervisory and managerial capacities").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, though, only one class of supervisors would be eliminated in practice, because the Board limits its categorical exclusion with a qualifier: Only professional judgment that is applied "in directing less-skilled employees to deliver services" is excluded from the statutory category of "independent judgment." Brief for Petitioner 11. This second rule is no less striking than the first, and is directly contrary to the text of the statute. &lt;i&gt;Every&lt;/i&gt; supervisory function listed by the Act is accompanied by the statutory requirement that its exercise "requir[e] the use of independent judgment" before supervisory status will obtain, &#167; 152(11), but the Board would apply its restriction upon "independent judgment" to just 1 of the 12 listed functions: "responsibly &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*716&lt;/span&gt; to direct." There is no apparent textual justification for this asymmetrical limitation, and the Board has offered none. Surely no conceptual justification can be found in the proposition that supervisors exercise professional, technical, or experienced judgment only when they direct other employees. Decisions "to hire, . . . suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, . . . or discipline" other employees, &lt;i&gt;ibid.,&lt;/i&gt; must often depend upon that same judgment, which enables assessment of the employee's proficiency in performing his job. See &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Yeshiva Univ., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 686 ("[M]ost professionals in managerial positions continue to draw on their special skills and training"). Yet in no opinion that we were able to discover has the Board held that a supervisor's judgment in hiring, disciplining, or promoting another employee ceased to be "independent judgment" because it depended upon the supervisor's professional or technical training or experience. When an employee exercises one of these functions with judgment that possesses a sufficient degree of independence, the Board invariably finds supervisory status. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trustees of Noble Hospital,&lt;/i&gt; 218 N. L. R. B. 1441, 1442 (1975).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board's refusal to apply its limiting interpretation of "independent judgment" to any supervisory function other than responsibly directing other employees is particularly troubling because just seven years ago we rejected the Board's interpretation of part three of the supervisory test that similarly was applied only to the same supervisory function. See &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Health Care &amp;amp; Retirement Corp. of America,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S. 571 (1994). In &lt;i&gt;Health Care,&lt;/i&gt; the Board argued that nurses did not exercise their authority "in the interest of the employer," as &#167; 152(11) requires, when their "independent judgment [was] exercised incidental to professional or technical judgment" instead of for "disciplinary or other matters, i. e., in addition to treatment of patients." &lt;i&gt;Northcrest Nursing Home,&lt;/i&gt; 313 N. L. R. B. 491, 505 (1993). It did not escape our notice that the target of this analysis &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*717&lt;/span&gt; was the supervisory function of responsible direction. "Under &#167; 2(11)," we noted, "an employee who in the course of employment uses independent judgment to engage in 1 of the 12 listed activities, including responsible direction of other employees, is a supervisor. Under the Board's test, however, a nurse who in the course of employment uses independent judgment to engage in responsible direction of other employees is not a supervisor." 511 U. S., at 578-579. We therefore rejected the Board's analysis as "inconsistent with . . . the statutory language," because it "rea[d] the responsible direction portion of &#167; 2(11) out of the statute in nurse cases." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 579-580. It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the Board's interpretation of "independent judgment," applied to nurses for the first time after our decision in &lt;i&gt;Health Care,&lt;/i&gt; has precisely the same object. This interpretation of "independent judgment" is no less strained than the interpretation of "in the interest of the employer" that it has succeeded.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Cf. &lt;i&gt;Allentown Mack Sales &amp;amp; Service, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;NLRB,&lt;/i&gt; 522 U. S. 359, 374 (1998) (an agency that announces one principle but applies another is not acting rationally under the Act).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board contends, however, that Congress incorporated the Board's categorical restrictions on "independent judgment" when it first added the term "supervisor" to the Act in 1947. We think history shows the opposite. The Act as originally passed by Congress in 1935 did not mention supervisors directly. It extended to "employees" the "right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*718&lt;/span&gt; [and] to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing . . . ." Act of July 5, 1935, &#167; 7, 49 Stat. 452, and it defined "employee" expansively (if circularly) to "include any employee," &#167; 2(3). We therefore held that supervisors were protected by the Act. &lt;i&gt;Packard Motor Car Co.&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;NLRB,&lt;/i&gt; 330 U. S. 485 (1947). Congress in response added to the Act the exemption we had found lacking. The Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (Taft-Hartley Act) expressly excluded "supervisors" from the definition of "employees" and thereby from the protections of the Act. &#167; 2(3), 61 Stat. 137, as amended, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 152(3) ("The term `employee' . . . shall not include . . . any individual employed as a supervisor"); Taft-Hartley Act &#167; 14(a), as amended, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 164(a) ("[N]o employer [covered by the Act] shall be compelled to deem individuals defined herein as supervisors as employees for the purpose of any law, either national or local, relating to collective bargaining").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well before the Taft-Hartley Act added the term "supervisor" to the Act, however, the Board had already been defining it, because while the Board agreed that supervisors were protected by the 1935 Act, it also determined that they should not be placed in the same bargaining unit as the employees they oversaw. To distinguish the two groups, the Board defined "supervisors" as employees who "supervise or direct the work of [other] employees . . . , &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; who have authority to hire, promote, discharge, discipline, or otherwise effect changes in the status of such employees." &lt;i&gt;Douglas Aircraft Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 50 N. L. R. B. 784, 787 (1943) (emphasis added). The "and" bears emphasis because it was a true conjunctive: The Board consistently held that employees whose only supervisory function was directing the work of other employees were not "supervisors" within its test. For example, in &lt;i&gt;Bunting Brass &amp;amp; Bronze Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 58 N. L. R. B. 618, 620 (1944), the Board wrote: "We are of the opinion that, while linemen do direct the work of [other] employees, they do not exercise substantial supervisory authority within the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*719&lt;/span&gt; usual meaning of that term." See also, &lt;i&gt;e. g., Duval Texas Sulphur Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 53 N. L. R. B. 1387, 1390-1391 (1943) ("As to the chief electrician, motor mechanic, plant engineers, and drillers, . . . [t]he fact that they work with helpers, and perforce direct and guide the work of their helpers, does not, of itself, elevate them to such supervisory rank that they must be excluded from the broad production and maintenance unit").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Taft-Hartley Act added the term "supervisor" to the Act in 1947, it largely borrowed the Board's definition of the term, with one notable exception: Whereas the Board required a supervisor to direct the work of other employees &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; perform another listed function, the Act permitted direction alone to suffice. "The term `supervisor' means any individual having authority . . . to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances." Taft-Hartley Act &#167; 2(11), as amended, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 152(11) (emphasis added). Moreover, the Act assuredly did &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; incorporate the Board's current interpretation of the term "independent judgment" as applied to the function of responsible direction, since the Board had not yet developed that interpretation. It had had no reason to do so, because it had limited the category of supervisors more directly, by requiring functions &lt;i&gt;in addition&lt;/i&gt; to responsible direction. It is the Act's alteration of precisely that aspect of the Board's jurisprudence that has pushed the Board into a running struggle to limit the impact of "responsibly to direct" on the number of employees qualifying for supervisory status&#151;presumably driven by the policy concern that otherwise the proper balance of labormanagement power will be disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is upon that policy concern that the Board ultimately rests its defense of its interpretation of "independent judgment." In arguments that parallel those expressed by the dissent in &lt;i&gt;Health Care,&lt;/i&gt; see 511 U. S., at 588-590 (Ginsburg, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*720&lt;/span&gt; J., dissenting), and which are adopted by Justice Stevens in this case, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 726-727, the Board contends that its interpretation is necessary to preserve the inclusion of "professional employees" within the coverage of the Act. See &#167; 2(12), 29 U. S. C. &#167; 152(12). Professional employees by definition engage in work "involving the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment." &#167; 152(12)(a)(ii). Therefore, the Board argues (enlisting dictum from our decision in &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Yeshiva Univ.,&lt;/i&gt; 444 U. S., at 690, and n. 30, that was rejected in &lt;i&gt;Health Care,&lt;/i&gt; see 511 U. S., at 581-582), if judgment of that sort makes one a supervisor under &#167; 152(11), then Congress's intent to include professionals in the Act will be frustrated, because "many professional employees (such as lawyers, doctors, and nurses) customarily give judgment-based direction to the less-skilled employees with whom they work," Brief for Petitioner 33. The problem with the argument is not the soundness of its labor policy (the Board is entitled to judge that without our constant second-guessing, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 494 U. S. 775, 786 (1990)). It is that the policy cannot be given effect through this statutory text. See &lt;i&gt;Health Care, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 581 ("[T]here may be `some tension between the Act's exclusion of [supervisory and] managerial employees and its inclusion of professionals,' but we find no authority for `suggesting that that tension can be resolved' by distorting the statutory language in the manner proposed by the Board") (quoting &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Yeshiva Univ., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 686). Perhaps the Board could offer a limiting interpretation of the supervisory function of responsible direction by distinguishing employees who direct the manner of others' performance of discrete &lt;i&gt;tasks&lt;/i&gt; from employees who direct other &lt;i&gt;employees,&lt;/i&gt; as &#167; 152(11) requires. Certain of the Board's decisions appear to have drawn that distinction in the past, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Providence Hospital,&lt;/i&gt; 320 N. L. R. B. 717, 729 (1996). We have no occasion to consider it here, however, because the Board has carefully &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*721&lt;/span&gt; insisted that the proper interpretation of "responsibly to direct" is not at issue in this case, see Brief for Petitioner 21-22, n. 9; Reply Brief for Petitioner 7-8, n. 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is at issue is the Board's contention that the policy of covering professional employees under the Act justifies the categorical exclusion of professional judgments from a term, "independent judgment," that naturally includes them. And further, that it justifies limiting this categorical exclusion to the supervisory function of responsibly directing other employees. These contentions contradict both the text and structure of the statute, and they contradict as well the rule of &lt;i&gt;Health Care&lt;/i&gt; that the test for supervisory status applies no differently to professionals than to other employees. 511 U. S., at 581. We therefore find the Board's interpretation unlawful. See &lt;i&gt;Allentown Mack Sales &amp;amp; Service, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;NLRB,&lt;/i&gt; 522 U. S., at 364 ("Courts must defer to the requirements imposed by the Board if they are `rational and consistent with the Act,' and if the Board's `explication is not inadequate, irrational or arbitrary' " (citations omitted)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may not enforce the Board's order by applying a legal standard the Board did not adopt, &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bell Aerospace Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 416 U. S. 267, 289-290 (1974); &lt;i&gt;SEC&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chenery Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 318 U. S. 80, 87-88 (1943), and, as we noted above, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 713, the Board has not asked us to do so. Hence, the Board's error in interpreting "independent judgment" precludes us from enforcing its order. Our decision in &lt;i&gt;Health Care,&lt;/i&gt; where the Board similarly had not asserted that its decision was correct on grounds apart from the one we rejected, see 511 U. S., at 584, simply affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals denying enforcement. Since that same condition applies here, see Brief for Petitioner 14, 42, and since neither party has suggested that &lt;i&gt;Health Care&lt;/i&gt; `s method for determining the propriety of a remand should &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*722&lt;/span&gt; not apply here, we take the same course.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; "Our conclusion that the Court of Appeals was correct to find the Board's test inconsistent with the statute . . . suffices to resolve the case." &lt;i&gt;Health Care, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 584. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the National Labor Relations Board correctly found that respondent, Kentucky River Community Care, Inc., failed to prove that the six registered nurses employed at its facility in Pippa Passes, Kentucky, are "supervisors" within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act. While we are unanimous in holding that the Court of Appeals set aside that finding based upon an incorrect allocation of the burden of proof, we disagree as to whether the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the Board misinterpreted the provision of the NLRA excluding supervisors from the Act's coverage. Moreover, even if I agreed with the majority's view that the Board's interpretation was error, that error would not justify affirming the erroneous decision of the Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*723&lt;/span&gt; I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the proceedings before the Board, respondent relied heavily on the fact that two registered nurses (RNs) served as "building supervisors" on weekends, and on the second and third shifts. However, as the Regional Director who considered the evidence noted, the RNs received no extra compensation for serving as building supervisors and did not have keys to the facility. Instead, the only additional responsibility shouldered by the RNs when serving as building supervisors was that of contacting other employees if a shift was not fully staffed according to preestablished ratios not set by the RNs. However, the RNs had no authority to compel an employee to stay on duty or to come to work to fill a vacancy under threat of discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to the RNs' regular duties, while they might "occasionally request other employees to perform routine tasks," they had no "authority to take any action if the employee refuse[d] their directives."&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; App. to Pet. for Cert. 51a. In their routine work, they had no "authority to hire, fire, reward, promote or independently discipline employees or to effectively recommend such action. They did not evaluate employees or take any action which would affect their employment status." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 52a. Indeed, the RNs, even when serving as "building supervisors," for the most part "work[ed] independently and by themselves without any subordinates." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on his evaluation of the evidence, the NLRB's Regional Director applied "the same test to registered nurses as is applicable to all other individuals in determining supervisory status." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Under that test, he concluded that "only supervisory personnel vested with `genuine management prerogatives' should be considered supervisors, and not `straw bosses, lead men, set-up men and other minor &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*724&lt;/span&gt; supervisory employees.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 53a (quoting &lt;i&gt;Chicago Metallic Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 273 N. L. R. B. 1677, 1688 (1985)). He did, however, exclude from the bargaining unit 10 specific supervisors including the nursing coordinator. App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the dissent of Judge Jones, the Court of Appeals set aside the Board's order. The panel majority first criticized the Board for ignoring its "repeated admonition" that the NLRB "`has the burden of proving that employees are not supervisors.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 15a. After acknowledging that "whether an employee is a supervisor is a highly factintensive inquiry," that majority concluded that the RNs' duties as building supervisors involved "independent judgment which is not limited to, or inherent in, the professional training of nurses." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 16a&#151;19a. The panel majority also criticized the NLRB for interpreting the admittedly ambiguous statutory term "independent judgment" inconsistently with Sixth Circuit precedent.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it is not necessary to do so to overturn the Court of Appeals' decision, the NLRB has asked us to reject the Sixth Circuit's interpretation of the term "independent judgment." In contrast to the Sixth Circuit, the NLRB interprets the term "independent judgment" as not including the exercise of ordinary professional or technical judgment in directing less-skilled employees to deliver services in accordance with employer-specified standards.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Provi-&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*725&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;dence Hospital,&lt;/i&gt; 320 N. L. R. B. 717 (1996), enforced, 121 F. 3d 548 (CA9 1997); &lt;i&gt;Nymed, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 320 N. L. R. B. 806 (1996); see also, &lt;i&gt;e. g., Graphics Typography, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 217 N. L. R. B. 1047, 1053 (1975), enforced mem., 547 F. 2d 1162 (CA3 1976). The Board's interpretation is a familiar one, which has been routinely applied in other employment contexts. See &lt;i&gt;Providence,&lt;/i&gt; 320 N. L. R. B., at 717; &lt;i&gt;Graphics Typography,&lt;/i&gt; 217 N. L. R. B., at 1053. Applying that interpretation, the NLRB has concluded that in some cases the employees in question are supervisors, and that in others they are not.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; See Brief for Petitioner 17-19, nn. 5-7 (collecting cases); see also Brief for Respondent Kentucky State District Council of Carpenters 36, n. 16 (collecting cases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question before us is whether the Board's interpretation is both "rational and consistent with the Act."&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 494 U. S. 775, 796 (1990); see &lt;i&gt;Fall River Dyeing &amp;amp; Finishing Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;NLRB,&lt;/i&gt; 482 U. S. 27, 42 (1987). To my mind, the Board's test is both fully rational and entirely consistent with the Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "independent judgment" is indisputably ambiguous, and it is settled law that the NLRB's interpretation &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*726&lt;/span&gt; of ambiguous language in the National Labor Relations Act is entitled to deference.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; See &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Health Care and Retirement Corporation,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S. 571, 579 (1994) &lt;i&gt;(HCR); &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Auciello Iron Works, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;NLRB,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S. 781, 787-788 (1996); &lt;i&gt;Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 494 U. S., at 786&#151; 787. Such deference is particularly appropriate when the statutory ambiguity is compounded by the use of one ambiguous term&#151;"independent judgment"&#151;to modify another, equally ambiguous term&#151;namely, "responsibly to direct."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, since Congress has expressly provided that professional employees are entitled to the protection of the Act, there is good reason to resolve the ambiguities consistently with the Board's interpretation. At the same time that Congress acted to exclude supervisors from the NLRA's protection, it explicitly extended those same protections to professionals, who, by definition, engage in work that involves "the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment in its performance."&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; 29 U. S. C. &#167; 152(12)(a)(ii). As this Court has acknowledged, the inclusion of professional employees and the exclusion of supervisors necessarily gives rise to some tension in the statutory text. Cf. &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Yeshiva Univ.,&lt;/i&gt; 444 U. S. 672, 686 (1980). Accordingly, if the term "supervisor" is construed too broadly, without regard for the statutory context, then Congress' inclusion of professionals &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*727&lt;/span&gt; within the Act's protections is effectively nullified.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; See &lt;i&gt;HCR,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S., at 585 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). In my opinion, the Court's approach does precisely what it accuses the Board of doing&#151;namely, reading one part of the statute to the exclusion of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court acknowledges today that deference is appropriate when the Board determines both the degree of discretion required for supervisory status as well as the significance of limitations on the alleged supervisor's discretion imposed by the employer. Thus, in a case like this, a court should not second-guess the Board's evaluation of the authority of the nurses as building supervisors, or of the significance of the employer's definition of that authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in a &lt;i&gt;tour de force&lt;/i&gt; supported by little more than &lt;i&gt;ipse dixit,&lt;/i&gt; the Court concludes that &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; deference is due the Board's evaluation of the "kind of judgment" that professional employees exercise. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 714 (emphasis deleted). Thus, under the Court's view, it is impermissible for the Board to attach a different weight to a nurse's judgment that an employee should be reassigned or disciplined than to a nurse's judgment that the employee should take a patient's temperature, even if nurses routinely instruct others to take a patient's temperature but do not ordinarily reassign or discipline employees. The Court's approach finds no support in the text of the statute, and is inconsistent with our case law. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yeshiva,&lt;/i&gt; 444 U. S., at 690 ("Only if an employee's activities fall outside the scope of the duties routinely &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*728&lt;/span&gt; performed by similarly situated professionals will he be found aligned with management").&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court further argues that the Board errs by not applying its limiting interpretation of the term "independent judgment" to all 12 functions identified by the statute as supervisory in nature. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 715-716. But of those 12, it is only "responsibly to direct" that is ambiguous and thus capable of swallowing the whole if not narrowly construed. The authority to "promote" or to "discharge," to use only two examples, is specific and readily identifiable. In contrast, the authority "responsibly to direct" is far more vague. Thus, it is only logical for the term "independent judgment" to take on different contours depending on the nature of the supervisory function at issue and its comparative ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, these are quintessential examples of terms that the expert agency should be allowed to interpret in the light of the policies animating the statute. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Curtin Matheson,&lt;/i&gt; 494 U. S., at 786; &lt;i&gt;Chevron U. S. A. Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 837, 843 (1984). Because the Board's interpretation is fully consistent both with the statutory text and with the policy favoring collective bargaining by professional employees, this Court is obligated to uphold it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if I shared the majority's view that the term "independent judgment" should be given the same meaning when applied to each of the 12 supervisory functions and when applied to professional and nonprofessional employees, I would not simply affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Cf. &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bell Aerospace Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 416 U. S. 267, 289&#151; 290 (1974); &lt;i&gt;SEC&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chenery Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 318 U. S. 80, 87-88 (1943). The Court's rejection of the Board's interpretation of the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*729&lt;/span&gt; term "independent judgment" does not justify a categorical affirmance of the Sixth Circuit's decision, which rests in part on an erroneous allocation of the burden of proof.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I do not agree with the majority's view. Given the Regional Director's findings that the RNs' duties as building supervisors do not qualify them as "supervisors" within the meaning of 29 U. S. C. &#167; 152(11), and that they, "`for the most part, work independently and by themselves without any subordinates,' " it is absolutely clear that the nurses in question are covered by the NLRA.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; 193 F. 3d 444, 457 (CA6 1999). The Court's willingness to treat them as supervisors even if they have no subordinates&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt; is particularly ironic when compared to the Board's undisturbed decision to deny supervisory status to the other group of professionals employed by respondent&#151;namely, the 20 rehabilitation counselors who supervise the work of 40 rehabilitation assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*730&lt;/span&gt; Accordingly, while I join Part II of the Court's opinion, I respectfully dissent from its holding. I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   Briefs of &lt;i&gt;amici curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal were filed for the American Nurses Association by &lt;i&gt;Barbara J. Sapin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Woody N. Peterson;&lt;/i&gt; and for the Service Employees International Union et al. by &lt;i&gt;Judith A. Scott, Diana O. Ceresi, Robert E. Funk, Jr., David J. Strom, Jack Dempsey,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Larry Weinberg.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefs of &lt;i&gt;amici curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging affirmance were filed for the American Health Care Association by &lt;i&gt;Thomas V. Walsh&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Thomas P. McDonough;&lt;/i&gt;  and for Human Resource Management et al. by &lt;i&gt;G. Roger King.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The Board in its reply brief in this Court steps back from this interpretation and argues that it has only drawn distinctions between degrees of authority. Reply Brief for Petitioner 3. But the opinions of the Board that developed its current interpretation of "independent judgment" clearly draw a categorical distinction. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Providence Hospital,&lt;/i&gt;  320 N. L. R. B. 717, 729 (1996) ("Section 2(11) supervisory authority does not include the authority of an employee to direct another to perform discrete tasks stemming from the directing employee's experience, skills, training, or position"). It is those opinions that were cited in the Regional Director's opinion resolving the representation dispute, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a&#151;53a, which was accepted without further review by the Board and was unreviewable in the unfair labor practice proceeding. "We do not, of course, substitute counsel's &lt;i&gt;post hoc&lt;/i&gt; rationale for the reasoning supplied by the Board itself." &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Yeshiva Univ.,&lt;/i&gt; 444 U. S. 672, 685, n. 22 (1980) (citing &lt;i&gt;SEC&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chenery Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 332 U. S. 194, 196 (1947)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Justice Stevens argues in this case, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 725-726 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), as the Board argued in &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Health Care &amp;amp; Retirement Corp. of America,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S. 571, 579 (1994), that the strain is eased by the ambiguity of a different term in the statute, "responsibly to direct." That argument is no more persuasive now than when we rejected it in &lt;i&gt;Health Care:&lt;/i&gt; "[A]mbiguity in one portion of a statute does not give the Board license to distort other provisions of the statute," &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Our decision in &lt;i&gt;Health Care&lt;/i&gt; cannot be distinguished,as Justice Stevens suggests,see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 729, n. 10,on the ground that there we found that the Court of Appeals had not erred in any respect.The basis for remand to an agency is the &lt;i&gt;agency's&lt;/i&gt; error on a point of law,not the reviewing court's.(That the reviewing court erred is irrelevant in light of"the settled rule that, in reviewing the decision of a lower court, it must be affirmed if the result is correct `although the lower court relied upon a wrong ground or gave a wrong reason,' " &lt;i&gt;SEC&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Chenery Corp.,&lt;/i&gt;  318 U. S.80,88 (1943) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Helvering&lt;/i&gt; v.&lt;i&gt;Gowran,&lt;/i&gt; 302 U. S.238, 245 (1937)).)And in&lt;i&gt;Health Care,&lt;/i&gt; as here, the Board erred in interpreting the test for supervisory status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The RNs did have the authority to file "incident reports, but so [could] any other employee." App. to Pet. for Cert. 51a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  "According to NLRB interpretations, the practice of a nurse supervising a nurse's aide in administering patient care, for example, does not involve `independent judgment.' The NLRB classifies these activities as `routine' because the nurses have the ability to direct patient care by virtue of their training and expertise, not because of their connection with `management.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 17a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Oddly, the majority in this Court omits one element&#151;namely, "`in accordance with employer-specified standards.' " &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 715-716. In so doing, it ignores a key nuance in the NLRB's position. That, however, is characteristic of the majority's treatment of the NLRB's position, which is at once more fact specific and far less categorical than the majority makes it out to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  The majority, however, pays scant heed to the adjudicative record when it asserts that the Board's interpretation would in essence eliminate the supervisory exception with respect to the "responsibly to direct" function. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 714-715.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  "[I]n many . . . contexts of labor policy, `[t]he ultimate problem is the balancing of the conflicting legitimate interests. The function of striking that balance to effectuate national labor policy is often a difficult and delicate responsibility, which the Congress committed primarily to the National Labor Relations Board, subject to limited judicial review.' " &lt;i&gt;Beth Israel Hospital&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;NLRB,&lt;/i&gt; 437 U. S. 483, 501 (1978) (quoting &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Truck Drivers,&lt;/i&gt; 353 U. S. 87, 96 (1957)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  The majority suggests that the Board's interpretation of the term "independent judgment" is particularly problematic in light of this Court's decision in &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Health Care &amp;amp; Retirement Corp. of America,&lt;/i&gt; 511 U. S. 571 (1994) &lt;i&gt;(HCR).&lt;/i&gt; But in &lt;i&gt;HCR,&lt;/i&gt; this Court concluded that the terms "independent judgment" and "responsibly to direct" were ambiguous, while the term at issue in that case, "in the interest of the employer," was not. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 579.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  As the American Nurses Association points out in its &lt;i&gt;amicus&lt;/i&gt; brief, the scope of nursing practice routinely involves the exercise of judgment and the supervision of others. Brief for American Nurses Association as &lt;i&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 2-6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  Moreover, so broad a reading seems contrary to congressional intent in enacting the supervisory exception. Rather, the definition of "supervisor" was intended to apply only to those employees with "genuine management prerogatives" so that those employees excluded from the Act's coverage would be "truly supervisory." S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 4, 19 (1947), 1 NLRB, Legislative History of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, pp. 410, 425 (1948).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9]  In fact, in &lt;i&gt;Yeshiva,&lt;/i&gt; 444 U. S., at 690, this Court concluded that the NLRB's decisions adopting such an approach "accurately capture[d] the intent of Congress."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[10]  Even under the Court's approach, since the NLRB might well prevail under the correct allocation of the burden of proof, the appropriate course of action in this case would be to return the case to the NLRB for further proceedings. See &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Bell Aerospace Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 416 U. S. 267, 295 (1974); see also &lt;i&gt;Electrical Workers&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;NLRB,&lt;/i&gt; 366 U. S. 667 (1961); &lt;i&gt;Ford Motor Co.&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;NLRB,&lt;/i&gt; 305 U. S. 364 (1939). &lt;i&gt;HCR,&lt;/i&gt; on which the majority relies, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 721-722, is not to the contrary. In that case, unlike in this one, we found no error in the lower court's decision. Here, however, the lower court erred in its allocation of the burden of proof, a fact which would seem to make a remand to the NLRB in order to apply what the majority deems to be the correct legal principle particularly appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[11]  Nor do the RNs exercise any of the other supervisorial functions listed in &#167; 152(11). They play no role in assigning staff to shifts on a permanent basis or in setting the staff-to-resident ratio. App. 18-19, 23-24. As noted above, the RNs, whether functioning in their ordinary capacity or as "building supervisors," do not have authority to hire, fire, reward, promote, or independently discipline employees, or to effectively recommend such action. Nor, for that matter, do they evaluate employees or take action that would affect their employment status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[12]  Neither the licensed practical nurses nor the rehabilitation assistants report to the RNs. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 30, 34, 45, 61.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;ARKANSAS&lt;br&gt;
v.&lt;br&gt;
SULLIVAN&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;No. 00-262.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;United States Supreme Court.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided May 29, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ARKANSAS
&lt;p&gt;Per Curiam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 1998, Officer Joe Taylor of the Conway, Arkansas, Police Department stopped respondent Sullivan for speeding and for having an improperly tinted windshield. Taylor approached Sullivan's vehicle, explained the reason for the stop, and requested Sullivan's license, registration, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*771&lt;/span&gt; and insurance documentation. Upon seeing Sullivan's license, Taylor realized that he was aware of "`intelligence on [Sullivan] regarding narcotics.' " 340 Ark. 318&#151;A, 318&#151;B, 16 S. W. 3d 551, 552 (2000). When Sullivan opened his car door in an (unsuccessful) attempt to locate his registration and insurance papers, Taylor noticed a rusted roofing hatchet on the car's floorboard. Taylor then arrested Sullivan for speeding, driving without his registration and insurance documentation, carrying a weapon (the roofing hatchet), and improper window tinting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After another officer arrived and placed Sullivan in his squad car, Officer Taylor conducted an inventory search of Sullivan's vehicle pursuant to the Conway Police Department's Vehicle Inventory Policy. Under the vehicle's armrest, Taylor discovered a bag containing a substance that appeared to him to be methamphetamine as well as numerous items of suspected drug paraphernalia. As a result of the detention and search, Sullivan was charged with various state-law drug offenses, unlawful possession of a weapon, and speeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sullivan moved to suppress the evidence seized from his vehicle on the basis that his arrest was merely a "pretext and sham to search" him and, therefore, violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Pet. for Cert. 3. The trial court granted the suppression motion and, on the State's interlocutory appeal, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed. 340 Ark. 315, 11 S. W. 3d 526 (2000). The State petitioned for rehearing, contending that the court had erred by taking into account Officer Taylor's subjective motivation, in disregard of this Court's opinion in &lt;i&gt;Whren&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S. 806 (1996). Over the dissent of three justices, the court rejected the State's argument that &lt;i&gt;Whren&lt;/i&gt; makes "the ulterior motives of police officers . . . irrelevant so long as there is probable cause for the traffic stop" and denied the State's rehearing petition. 340 Ark., at 318&#151;B, 16 S. W. 3d, at 552.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*771&lt;/span&gt; The Arkansas Supreme Court declined to follow &lt;i&gt;Whren&lt;/i&gt; on the ground that "much of it is &lt;i&gt;dicta.&lt;/i&gt; " 340 Ark., at 318&#151;B, 16 S. W. 3d, at 552. The court reiterated the trial judge's conclusion that "the arrest was pretextual and made for the purpose of searching Sullivan's vehicle for evidence of a crime," and observed that "we do not believe that &lt;i&gt;Whren&lt;/i&gt;  disallows" suppression on such a basis. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 318&#151;C, 16 S. W. 3d, at 552. Finally, the court asserted that, even if it were to conclude that &lt;i&gt;Whren&lt;/i&gt; precludes inquiry into an arresting officer's subjective motivation, "there is nothing that prevents this court from interpreting the U. S. Constitution more broadly than the United States Supreme Court, which has the effect of providing more rights." 340 Ark., at 318&#151;C, 16 S. W. 3d, at 552.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision on rehearing is flatly contrary to this Court's controlling precedent, we grant the State's petition for a writ of certiorari and reverse.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; As an initial matter, we note that the Arkansas Supreme Court never questioned Officer Taylor's authority to arrest Sullivan for a fine-only traffic violation (speeding), and rightly so. See &lt;i&gt;Atwater&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lago Vista, ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 318. Rather, the court affirmed the trial judge's suppression of the drug-related evidence on the theory that Officer Taylor's arrest of Sullivan, although supported by probable cause, nonetheless violated the Fourth Amendment because Taylor had an improper subjective motivation for making the stop. The Arkansas Supreme Court's holding to that effect cannot be squared with our decision in &lt;i&gt;Whren,&lt;/i&gt; in which we noted our "unwilling[ness] to entertain Fourth Amendment challenges based on the actual motivations of individual officers," &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*772&lt;/span&gt; and held unanimously that "[s]ubjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis." 517 U. S., at 813. That &lt;i&gt;Whren&lt;/i&gt; involved a traffic stop, rather than a custodial arrest, is of no particular moment; indeed, &lt;i&gt;Whren&lt;/i&gt; itself relied on &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Robinson,&lt;/i&gt; 414 U. S. 218 (1973), for the proposition that "a traffic-violation arrest . . . [will] not be rendered invalid by the fact that it was `a mere pretext for a narcotics search.' " 517 U. S., at 812-813.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arkansas Supreme Court's alternative holding, that it may interpret the United States Constitution to provide greater protection than this Court's own federal constitutional precedents provide, is foreclosed by &lt;i&gt;Oregon&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hass,&lt;/i&gt;  420 U. S. 714 (1975). There, we observed that the Oregon Supreme Court's statement that it could "`interpret the Fourth Amendment more restrictively than interpreted by the United States Supreme Court' " was "not the law and surely must be an inadvertent error." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 719, n. 4. We reiterated in &lt;i&gt;Hass&lt;/i&gt; that while "a State is free &lt;i&gt;as a matter of its own law&lt;/i&gt; to impose greater restrictions on police activity than those this Court holds to be necessary upon federal constitutional standards," it "may not impose such greater restrictions as a matter of &lt;i&gt;federal constitutional law&lt;/i&gt;  when this Court specifically refrains from imposing them." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 719.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Arkansas Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Breyer join, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arkansas Supreme Court was moved by a concern rooted in the Fourth Amendment. Validating Kenneth Sullivan's arrest, the Arkansas court feared, would accord police officers disturbing discretion to intrude on individuals' liberty &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*773&lt;/span&gt; and privacy. See 340 Ark. 318&#151;A, 318&#151;B, 16 S. W. 3d 551, 552 (2000) (expressing unwillingness "to sanction conduct where a police officer can trail a targeted vehicle with a driver merely suspected of criminal activity, wait for the driver to exceed the speed limit by one mile per hour, arrest the driver for speeding, and conduct a full-blown inventory search of the vehicle with impunity"). But this Court has held that such exercises of official discretion are unlimited by the Fourth Amendment. See &lt;i&gt;Atwater&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lago Vista, ante,&lt;/i&gt;  p. 318; &lt;i&gt;Whren&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 517 U. S. 806 (1996). Given the Court's current case law, I join the Court's opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Atwater,&lt;/i&gt; which recognized no constitutional limitation on arrest for a fine-only misdemeanor offense, this Court relied in part on a perceived "dearth of horribles demanding redress." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 353. Although I joined a dissenting opinion questioning the relevance of the Court's conclusion on that score, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 372 (opinion of O'Connor, J.), I hope the Court's perception proves correct. But if it does not, if experience demonstrates "anything like an epidemic of unnecessary minor-offense arrests," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 353 (opinion of the Court), I hope the Court will reconsider its recent precedent. See &lt;i&gt;Vasquez&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hillery,&lt;/i&gt; 474 U. S. 254, 266 (1986) (observing that Court has departed from &lt;i&gt;stare decisis&lt;/i&gt; when necessary "to bring its opinions into agreement with experience and with facts newly ascertained") (quoting &lt;i&gt;Burnet&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Coronado Oil &amp;amp; Gas Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 285 U. S. 393, 412 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   Sullivan's motion for leave to proceed &lt;i&gt;in forma pauperis&lt;/i&gt; is granted. We have jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1257 notwithstanding the absence of final judgment in the underlying prosecution. See &lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Quarles,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 649, 651, n. 1 (1984) ("[S]hould the State convict respondent at trial, its claim that certain evidence was wrongfully suppressed will be moot. Should respondent be acquitted at trial, the State will be precluded from pressing its federal claim again on appeal").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Decided May 29, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*733&lt;/span&gt; Souter, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nancy Winkelman&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With her on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Joseph T. Lukens&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ralph N. Sianni.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gerald J. Pappert,&lt;/i&gt; First Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania, argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;D. Michael Fisher,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, &lt;i&gt;John G. Knorr III,&lt;/i&gt; Chief Deputy Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;Gwendolyn T. Mosley&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Calvin R. Koons,&lt;/i&gt; Senior Deputy Attorneys General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Irving L. Gornstein&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging affirmance. With him on &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*733&lt;/span&gt; the brief were &lt;i&gt;Acting Solicitor General Underwood,&lt;/i&gt; former &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman,&lt;/i&gt; former &lt;i&gt;Assistant Attorney General Ogden, Barbara L. Herwig,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Peter R. Maier.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Souter, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 amended 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1997e(a), which now requires a prisoner to exhaust &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*734&lt;/span&gt; "such administrative remedies as are available" before suing over prison conditions. The question is whether an inmate seeking only money damages must complete a prison administrative process that could provide some sort of relief on the complaint stated, but no money. We hold that he must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner, Timothy Booth, was an inmate at the State Correctional Institution at Smithfield, Pennsylvania, when he began this action under Rev. Stat. &#167; 1979, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1983, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. He claimed that respondent corrections officers at Smithfield violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by assaulting him, bruising his wrists in tightening and twisting handcuffs placed upon him, throwing cleaning material in his face, and denying him medical attention to treat ensuing injuries. Booth sought various forms of injunctive relief, including transfer to another prison, as well as several hundred thousand dollars in money damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections provided an administrative grievance system at the time. It called for a written charge within 15 days of an event prompting an inmate's complaint, which was referred to a grievance officer for investigation and resolution. If any action taken or recommended was unsatisfactory to the inmate, he could appeal to an intermediate reviewing authority, with the possibility of a further and final appeal to a central review committee. App. 46-50. While the grievance system addressed complaints of the abuse and excessive force Booth alleged, it had no provision for recovery of money damages.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before resorting to federal court, Booth filed an administrative grievance charging at least some of the acts of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*735&lt;/span&gt; abuse he later alleged in his action. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 10-14. He did not, however, go beyond the first step, and never sought intermediate or final administrative review after the prison authority denied relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Booth's failure to avail himself of the later stages of the administrative process led the District Court to dismiss the complaint without prejudice for failure to exhaust "administrative remedies . . . available" within the meaning of 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1997e(a) (1994 ed., Supp. V). See App. to Pet. for Cert. 38a. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, 206 F. 3d 289 (2000), rejecting Booth's argument that the statutory exhaustion requirement is inapposite to his case simply because the Commonwealth's administrative process could not award him the monetary relief he sought (money then being the only relief still requested, since Booth's transfer to another institution had mooted his claims for injunctive orders).&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Although the Third Circuit acknowledged that several other Courts of Appeals had held the exhaustion requirement subject to exception when the internal grievance procedure could not provide an inmateplaintiff with the purely monetary relief requested in his federal action, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Whitley&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hunt,&lt;/i&gt; 158 F. 3d 882 (CA5 1998); &lt;i&gt;Lunsford&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jumao-As,&lt;/i&gt; 155 F. 3d 1178 (CA9 1998); &lt;i&gt;Garrett&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hawk,&lt;/i&gt; 127 F. 3d 1263 (CA10 1997), the court found no such exception in the statute, 206 F. 3d, at 299-300; accord, &lt;i&gt;Freeman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Francis,&lt;/i&gt; 196 F. 3d 641 (CA6 1999); &lt;i&gt;Alexander&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hawk,&lt;/i&gt; 159 F. 3d 1321 (CA11 1998). We granted certiorari to address this conflict among the Circuits, 531 U. S. 956 (2000), and we now affirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*736&lt;/span&gt; II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995,&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1997e(a) (1994 ed., Supp. V) provides that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning of the phrase "administrative remedies . . . available" is the crux of the case, and up to a point the parties approach it with agreement. Neither of them denies that some redress for a wrong is presupposed by the statute's requirement of an "available" "remed[y]"; neither argues that exhaustion is required where the relevant administrative procedure lacks authority to provide any relief or to take any action whatsoever in response to a complaint.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; The dispute here, then, comes down to whether or not a remedial scheme is "available" where, as in Pennsylvania, the administrative process has authority to take some action in response to a complaint, but not the remedial action an inmate demands to the exclusion of all other forms of redress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In seeking the congressional intent, the parties urge us to give weight to practical considerations, among others, and at first glance Booth's position holds some intuitive appeal. Although requiring an inmate to exhaust prison grievance procedures will probably obviate some litigation when the administrative tribunal can award at least some of the relief sought, Booth argues that when the prison's process simply cannot satisfy the inmate's sole demand, the odds of keeping &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*737&lt;/span&gt; the matter out of court are slim. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 16. The prisoner would be clearly burdened, while the government would obtain little or no value in return. The respondents, however, also have something to say. They argue that requiring exhaustion in these circumstances would produce administrative results that would satisfy at least some inmates who start out asking for nothing but money, since the very fact of being heard and prompting administrative change can mollify passions even when nothing ends up in the pocket. And one may suppose that the administrative process itself would filter out some frivolous claims and foster better-prepared litigation once a dispute did move to the courtroom, even absent formal fact finding. Although we have not accorded much weight to these possibilities in the past, see &lt;i&gt;McCarthy&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Madigan,&lt;/i&gt; 503 U. S. 140, 155-156 (1992), Congress, as we explain below, may well have thought we were shortsighted. See &lt;i&gt;infra,&lt;/i&gt; at 739-741. In any event, the practical arguments for exhaustion at least suffice to refute Booth's claim that no policy considerations justify respondents' position. The upshot is that pragmatism is inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the parties also says that the plain meaning of the words "remedies" and "available" in the phrase "such administrative remedies . . . available" is controlling. But as it turns out both of them quote some of the same dictionary definitions of "available" "remedies," and neither comes up with anything conclusive. Booth says the term "remedy" means a procedure that provides redress for wrong or enforcement of a right, and "available" means having sufficient power to achieve an end sought. See Brief for Petitioner 15-16 (citing Webster's Third New International Dictionary 150, 1920 (1993) (defining "remedy" as "the legal means to recover a right or to prevent or obtain redress for a wrong" and "available" as "having sufficient power or force to achieve an end," "capable of use for the accomplishment of a purpose," and that which "is accessible or may be obtained")). &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*738&lt;/span&gt; So far so good, but Booth then claims to be able to infer with particularity that when a prisoner demands money damages as the sole means to compensate his injuries, a grievance system without that relief offers no "available" "remed[y]." The general definitions, however, just do not entail such a specific conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strikes us that the same definitions get the respondent corrections officers and their &lt;i&gt;amicus&lt;/i&gt; the United States closer to firm ground for their assertion that the phrase "such administrative remedies as are available" naturally requires a prisoner to exhaust the grievance procedures offered, whether or not the possible responses cover the specific relief the prisoner demands. See Brief for Respondents 21. The United States tracks Booth in citing Webster's Third New International Dictionary to define "remedy" as "the legal means to recover a right or to prevent or obtain redress for a wrong" and "available" as "capable of use for the accomplishment of a purpose." Webster's Third New International Dictionary, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 150, 1920. But this exercise in isolated definition is ultimately inconclusive, for, depending on where one looks, "remedy" can mean either specific relief obtainable at the end of a process of seeking redress, or the process itself, the procedural avenue leading to some relief. See Black's Law Dictionary 1296 (7th ed. 1999) (defining "remedy" alternatively as "[t]he means of enforcing a right or preventing or redressing a wrong," or as "remedial action. . . . Cf. relief").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find clearer pointers toward the congressional objective in two considerations, the first being the broader statutory context in which "available" "remedies" are mentioned. The entire modifying clause in which the words occur is this: "until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted." The "available" "remed[y]" must be "exhausted" before a complaint under &#167; 1983 may be entertained. While the modifier "available" requires the possibility of some relief for the action complained of (as the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*739&lt;/span&gt; parties agree), the word "exhausted" has a decidedly procedural emphasis. It makes sense only in referring to the procedural means, not the particular relief ordered. It would, for example, be very strange usage to say that a prisoner must "exhaust" an administrative order reassigning an abusive guard before a prisoner could go to court and ask for something else; or to say (in States that award money damages administratively) that a prisoner must "exhaust" his damages award before going to court for more. How would he "exhaust" a transfer of personnel? Would he have to spend the money to "exhaust" the monetary relief given him? It makes no sense to demand that someone exhaust "such administrative [redress]" as is available; one "exhausts" processes, not forms of relief, and the statute provides that one must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second consideration, statutory history, confirms the suggestion that Congress meant to require procedural exhaustion regardless of the fit between a prisoner's prayer for relief and the administrative remedies possible. Before &#167; 1997e(a) was amended by the Act of 1995, a court had discretion (though no obligation) to require a state inmate to exhaust "such . . . remedies as are available," but only if those remedies were "plain, speedy, and effective." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1997e(a) (1994 ed.). That scheme, however, is now a thing of the past, for the amendments eliminated both the discretion to dispense with administrative exhaustion and the condition that the remedy be "plain, speedy, and effective" before exhaustion could be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significance of deleting that condition is apparent in light of our decision two years earlier in &lt;i&gt;McCarthy&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Madigan, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; In &lt;i&gt;McCarthy,&lt;/i&gt; a federal inmate, much like Booth, sought only money damages against federal prison officials, and the Bureau of Prison's administrative procedure offered no such relief. Although &#167; 1997e(a) did not at that time apply to suits brought against federal officials, the government argued that the Court should create an analogous &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*740&lt;/span&gt; exhaustion requirement for &lt;i&gt;Bivens&lt;/i&gt; actions. See &lt;i&gt;Bivens&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,&lt;/i&gt; 403 U. S. 388 (1971). It proposed &#167; 1997e(a) as a model, on the assumption that the provision required exhaustion by those seeking nothing but money damages even when money was unavailable at the administrative level. We understood the effect of &#167; 1997e(a) to be quite different, however. See 503 U. S., at 149-151. In holding that exhaustion was not required, we reasoned in part from the language of &#167; 1997e(a) that required an "effective" administrative remedy as a precondition to exhaustion. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 150. When a prisoner sought only money damages, we indicated, only a procedure able to provide money damages would be "effective" within the meaning of the statute. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; ("[I]n contrast to the absence of any provision for the award of money damages under the Bureau's general grievance procedure, the statute conditions exhaustion on the existence of `effective administrative remedies' "); see also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 156 (Rehnquist, C. J., joined by Scalia and Thomas, JJ., concurring in judgment) ("[I]n cases . . . where prisoners seek monetary relief, the Bureau's administrative remedy furnishes no effective remedy").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Congress replaced the text of the statute as construed in &lt;i&gt;McCarthy&lt;/i&gt; with the exhaustion requirement at issue today, it presumably understood that under &lt;i&gt;McCarthy&lt;/i&gt;  the term "effective" in the former &#167; 1997e(a) eliminated the possibility of requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies when an inmate sought only monetary relief and the administrative process offered none. It has to be significant that Congress removed the very term we had previously emphasized in reaching the result Booth now seeks, and the fair inference to be drawn is that Congress meant to preclude the &lt;i&gt;McCarthy&lt;/i&gt; result.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; Congress's imposition &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*741&lt;/span&gt; of an obviously broader exhaustion requirement makes it highly implausible that it meant to give prisoners a strong inducement to skip the administrative process simply by limiting prayers for relief to money damages not offered through administrative grievance mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, we think that Congress has mandated exhaustion clearly enough, regardless of the relief offered through administrative procedures.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; Cf. &lt;i&gt;McCarthy,&lt;/i&gt; 503 U. S., at 144 ("Where Congress specifically mandates, exhaustion is required"). We accordingly affirm the judgment of the Third Circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Stridiron&lt;/i&gt; of the Virgin Islands, &lt;i&gt;Christine O. Gregoire&lt;/i&gt; of Washington, and &lt;i&gt;Gay Woodhouse&lt;/i&gt; of Wyoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The Commonwealth has since modified its grievance scheme to permit awards of money. App. 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  There is some uncertainty, probably stemming in part from the ambiguity of Booth's &lt;i&gt;pro se&lt;/i&gt; filings in District Court, as to whether all of Booth's claims for relief other than money damages became moot when he was transferred. See Brief for Petitioner 12, n. 7; Brief for United States as &lt;i&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/i&gt; 10, n. 2. We assume for present purposes that only Booth's claims for money damages remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  110 Stat. 1321, as renumbered and amended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Without the possibility of some relief, the administrative officers would presumably have no authority to act on the subject of the complaint, leaving the inmate with nothing to exhaust. The parties do not dispute that the state grievance system at issue in this case has authority to take some responsive action with respect to the type of allegations Booth raises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  This inference is, to say the least, also consistent with Congress's elimination of the requirement that administrative procedures must satisfy certain "minimum acceptable standards" of fairness and effectiveness before inmates can be required to exhaust them, and the elimination of courts' discretion to excuse exhaustion when it would not be "appropriate and in the interests of justice." Compare 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1997e(a) (1994 ed., Supp. V) with 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1997e(a) (1994 ed.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  That Congress has mandated exhaustion in either case defeats the argument of Booth and supporting &lt;i&gt;amici&lt;/i&gt; that this reading of &#167; 1997e (1994 ed., Supp. V) is at odds with traditional doctrines of administrative exhaustion, under which a litigant need not apply to an agency that has "no power to decree . . . relief," &lt;i&gt;Reiter&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cooper,&lt;/i&gt; 507 U. S. 258, 269 (1993), or need not exhaust where doing so would otherwise be futile. See Brief for Petitioner 24-27; Brief for Brennan Center for Justice et al. as &lt;i&gt;Amici Curiae.&lt;/i&gt; Without getting into the force of this claim generally, we stress the point (which Booth acknowledges, see Reply Brief for Petitioner 4) that we will not read futility or other exceptions into statutory exhaustion requirements where Congress has provided otherwise. See &lt;i&gt;McCarthy&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Madigan,&lt;/i&gt; 503 U. S. 140, 144 (1992); cf. &lt;i&gt;Weinberger&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Salfi,&lt;/i&gt; 422 U. S. 749, 766-767 (1975). Here, we hold only that Congress has provided in &#167; 1997e(a) that an inmate must exhaust irrespective of the forms of relief sought and offered through administrative avenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Argued April 25, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided June 4, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*776&lt;/span&gt; Rehnquist, C. J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Robert J. Krauss,&lt;/i&gt; Senior Assistant Attorney General of Florida, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Robert A. Butterworth,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, &lt;i&gt;Carolyn M. Snurkowski,&lt;/i&gt; Assistant Deputy Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;John M. Klawikofsky,&lt;/i&gt; Assistant Attorney General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gregory G. Garre&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Acting Solicitor General Underwood, Acting Assistant Attorney General Keeney,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cynthia J. Dodge&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With her on the brief was &lt;i&gt;James Marion Moorman.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*776&lt;/span&gt; Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Belton,&lt;/i&gt; 453 U. S. 454 (1981), we established a "bright-line" rule permitting a law enforcement officer who has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of a car to search the passenger compartment of that car as a contemporaneous incident of the arrest. We granted certiorari to consider whether that rule is limited to situations in which the officer initiates contact with the occupant of a vehicle while that person remains inside the vehicle. 531 U. S. 1069 (2001). We find, however, that we lack jurisdiction to decide the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the evening at issue, officers were present at a home in Polk County, Florida, investigating the sale of marijuana and making arrests. Respondent Robert Thomas drove up to the residence, parked in the driveway, and walked toward the back of his vehicle. Officer J. D. Maney met Thomas at the rear of Thomas' vehicle, and asked him his name and whether he had a driver's license. After a check of Thomas' license revealed an outstanding warrant for his arrest, Officer Maney arrested him, handcuffed him, and took him inside the residence. The officer then went back outside, alone, and searched Thomas' car. The search revealed several small bags containing a white substance that tested positive for methamphetamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent was charged with possession of methamphetamine and related narcotics offenses. The trial court granted his motion to suppress the evidence of narcotics and narcotic paraphernalia. The Second District Court of Appeal reversed, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/fladistctapp/9VNf/state-v-thomas/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;711&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;So. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1241&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1998), finding the search valid under &lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Belton, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; The Supreme Court of Florida in turn reversed, holding that &lt;i&gt;Belton&lt;/i&gt; did not apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court held that "&lt;i&gt;Belton&lt;/i&gt; `s bright-line rule is limited to situations where the law enforcement officer initiates contact with the defendant" while the defendant remains in the car. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;761&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;So. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1010&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 1014 (2000). The court concluded &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*777&lt;/span&gt; that &lt;i&gt;Belton&lt;/i&gt; was inapplicable, and directed that the trial court determine "whether the factors in &lt;i&gt;Chimel&lt;/i&gt; [v. &lt;i&gt;California,&lt;/i&gt; 395 U. S. 752 (1969),] justify the search of Thomas' vehicle." 761 So. 2d, at 1014. The court explained that "[b]ased on the record . . . we are unable to ascertain whether [the officer's] safety was endangered or whether the preservation of the evidence was in jeopardy," as necessary to justify the search under &lt;i&gt;Chimel&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;California,&lt;/i&gt; 395 U. S. 752 (1969), and remanded for further proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the parties did not raise the issue in their briefs on the merits, we must first consider whether we have jurisdiction to decide this case. See &lt;i&gt;Duquesne Light Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Barasch,&lt;/i&gt; 488 U. S. 299, 306 (1989). Title 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1257(a) authorizes this Court to review "[f]inal judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had . . . where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution." In a criminal prosecution, finality generally "is defined by a judgment of conviction and the imposition of a sentence." &lt;i&gt;Fort Wayne Books, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Indiana,&lt;/i&gt; 489 U. S. 46, 54 (1989). But we have not, in practice, interpreted the finality rule so strictly. In certain circumstances, we have "treated statecourt judgments as final for jurisdictional purposes although there were further proceedings to take place in the state court." &lt;i&gt;Flynt&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ohio,&lt;/i&gt; 451 U. S. 619, 620-621 (1981) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Cox Broadcasting Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cohn,&lt;/i&gt; 420 U. S. 469 (1975), we divided cases of this kind into four categories. None fits the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court, however, and we therefore conclude that its judgment is not final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;i&gt;Cox&lt;/i&gt; category includes those cases in which "there are further proceedings&#151;even entire trials&#151;yet to occur in the state courts but where for one reason or another the federal issue is conclusive or the outcome of further proceedings preordained." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 479. The prototypical example of this category is &lt;i&gt;Mills&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Alabama,&lt;/i&gt; 384 U. S. 214 (1966). There the Supreme Court of Alabama held that a statute &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*778&lt;/span&gt; which prohibited the publication of an editorial endorsement on election day did not violate the First Amendment, and remanded the case for trial. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 216-217. Mills conceded that his only defense to the state charge was his constitutional claim; he admitted that he did publish the editorial. We held that this was a "final judgment" and took jurisdiction, saying that a trial "would be no more than a few formal gestures leading inexorably towards a conviction, and then another appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court for it formally to repeat its rejection of Mills' constitutional contentions whereupon the case could then once more wind its weary way back to us as a judgment unquestionably final and appealable. Such a roundabout process would not only be an inexcusable delay of the benefits Congress intended to grant by providing for appeal to this Court, but it would also result in a completely unnecessary waste of time and energy in judicial systems already troubled by delays due to congested dockets." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 217-218.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision of the Supreme Court of Florida here differs considerably from that of the state court in &lt;i&gt;Mills.&lt;/i&gt; The Florida Supreme Court remanded the case not only for application of &lt;i&gt;Chimel,&lt;/i&gt; but for further fact finding, and the State has not conceded that the search is invalid under &lt;i&gt;Chimel.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Cox&lt;/i&gt; `s second category are those cases in which "the federal issue, finally decided by the highest court in the State, will survive and require decision regardless of the outcome of future state-court proceedings." 420 U. S., at 480. In &lt;i&gt;Cox&lt;/i&gt; we used our decision in &lt;i&gt;Radio Station WOW, Inc.&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Johnson,&lt;/i&gt; 326 U. S. 120 (1945), to illustrate the second category. We said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In &lt;i&gt;Radio Station WOW,&lt;/i&gt; the Nebraska Supreme Court directed the transfer of the properties of a federally licensed radio station and ordered an accounting, rejecting the claim that the transfer order would interfere with the federal license. . . . Nothing that could happen &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*779&lt;/span&gt; in the course of the accounting, short of settlement of the case, would foreclose or make unnecessary decision on the federal question." &lt;i&gt;Cox, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 480.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, however, were the Florida courts to find that &lt;i&gt;Chimel&lt;/i&gt; allows the search, a decision on the &lt;i&gt;Belton&lt;/i&gt; issue would no longer be necessary. We have also noted that we treat state-court judgments in this category as final on the assumption that "`the federal questions that could come here have been adjudicated by the State court,' " and the state proceedings to take place on remand "`could not remotely give rise to a federal question . . . that may later come here.' " &lt;i&gt;Cox,&lt;/i&gt; 420 U. S., at 480. We cannot make that assumption in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cases where "the federal claim has been finally decided, with further proceedings on the merits in the state courts to come, but in which later review of the federal issue cannot be had, whatever the ultimate outcome of the case," fall into &lt;i&gt;Cox&lt;/i&gt; `s third category. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 481. &lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Quarles,&lt;/i&gt; 467 U. S. 649 (1984), is such a case. Respondent was charged in state court with criminal possession of a weapon, and certain evidence was suppressed on federal constitutional grounds. We granted the petition for certiorari and reversed, explaining that the suppression ruling was a "final judgment" although respondent had yet to be tried. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 651. We said that this case fell within &lt;i&gt;Cox&lt;/i&gt; `s third category because "should the State convict respondent at trial, its claim that certain evidence was wrongfully suppressed will be moot. Should respondent be acquitted at trial, the State will be precluded from pressing its federal claim again on appeal." 467 U. S., at 651, and n. 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deny review here would not necessarily cause Florida to go to trial without the suppressed evidence, with further appeal barred in the event of an acquittal or the federal claim mooted in the event of a conviction. The state court has &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*780&lt;/span&gt; yet to decide whether the evidence should be suppressed; that will be resolved on remand. If the State prevails on remand and the evidence is admitted under &lt;i&gt;Chimel,&lt;/i&gt; then the &lt;i&gt;Belton&lt;/i&gt; issue will be moot, and the State cannot seek review of it. But if the State loses, and the evidence is suppressed, Florida law allows the State to appeal, as long as it does so prior to trial. Fla. Stat. &#167; 924.071(1) (1996) ("The state may appeal from a pretrial order . . . suppressing evidence"); Fla. Rule App. Proc. 9.140(c)(1)(B) (2001) ("The state may appeal an order . . . suppressing before trial . . . evidence obtained by search and seizure"). Should the Supreme Court of Florida rule against the State on the &lt;i&gt;Chimel&lt;/i&gt;  issue, the question of suppression would be finally decided by the Florida courts, and the State could then seek certiorari in this Court. At that time it could obtain review of both the &lt;i&gt;Belton&lt;/i&gt; issue and the &lt;i&gt;Chimel&lt;/i&gt; issue. See &lt;i&gt;Jefferson&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;City of Tarrant,&lt;/i&gt; 522 U. S. 75, 83 (1997).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth &lt;i&gt;Cox&lt;/i&gt; category includes those cases where "the federal issue has been finally decided in the state courts with further proceedings pending in which the party seeking review here might prevail on the merits on nonfederal grounds, thus rendering unnecessary review of the federal issue by this Court, and where reversal of the state court on the federal issue would be preclusive of any further litigation on the relevant cause of action rather than merely controlling the nature and character of, or determining the admissibility of evidence in, the state proceedings still to come. In these circumstances, if a refusal immediately to review the statecourt decision might seriously erode federal policy, the Court has entertained and decided the federal issue, which itself has been finally determined by the state courts for purposes of the state litigation." 420 U. S., at 482-483.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the State can make no claim of serious erosion of federal policy that is not common to all run-of-the-mine decisions suppressing evidence in criminal trials. The fourth &lt;i&gt;Cox&lt;/i&gt; exception does not apply here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*781&lt;/span&gt; For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss the writ of certiorari for want of jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Argued April 18, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided June 4, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*813&lt;/span&gt; Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, Parts I, II&#151;A, and II&#151;B-1 of which were unanimous, and Part II&#151;B-2 of which was joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Stevens, O'Connor, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ.Ginsburg, J., filed an opinion concurring in part, in which Souter and Breyer, JJ., joined, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 820.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;James T. Ferrini&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Kimbley A. Kearney, Melinda S. Kollross, Robert M. Tata,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Carl D. Gray.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Patrick H. O'Donnell&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;John R. Crumpler, Jr.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Scalia, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question presented in this case is whether the negligent breach of a general maritime duty of care is actionable when it causes death, as it is when it causes injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint that respondent filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, her son, Christopher Garris, sustained injuries on April 8, 1997, that caused his death one day later. App. to Pet. for Cert. 53. The injuries were suffered while Garris was performing sandblasting work aboard the USNS &lt;i&gt;Maj. Stephen W. Pless&lt;/i&gt; in the employ of Tidewater Temps, Inc., a subcontractor for Mid-Atlantic Coatings, Inc., which was in turn a subcontractor for petitioner Norfolk Shipbuilding &amp;amp; Drydock Corporation. And the injuries were caused, the complaint continued, by the negligence of petitioner and one of its other subcontractors, since dismissed from this case. Because the vessel was berthed in the navigable waters of the United States when Garris was injured, respondent invoked federal admiralty jurisdiction, U. S. Const., Art. III, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*813&lt;/span&gt; &#167; 2, cl. 1; 28 U. S. C. &#167; 1333, and prayed for damages under general maritime law. She also asserted claims under the Virginia wrongful-death statute, Va. Code Ann. &#167;&#167; 8.01-50 to 8.01-56 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a federal claim, for the categorical reason that "no cause of action exists, under general maritime law, for death of a nonseaman in state territorial waters resulting from negligence." 1999 A. M. C. 769 (1998). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and remanded for further proceedings, explaining that although this Court had not yet recognized a maritime cause of action for wrongful death resulting from negligence, the principles contained in our decision in &lt;i&gt;Moragne&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;States Marine Lines, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 398 U. S. 375 (1970), made such an action appropriate. 210 F. 3d 209, 211 (2000). Judge Hall concurred in the judgment because, in her view, &lt;i&gt;Moragne&lt;/i&gt; had itself recognized the action. 210 F. 3d, at 222-227. The Court of Appeals denied petitioner's suggestion for rehearing en banc, with two judges dissenting. 215 F. 3d 420 (2000). We granted certiorari. 531 U. S. 1050 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of four issues of general maritime law are settled, and the fourth is before us. It is settled that the general maritime law imposes duties to avoid unseaworthiness and negligence, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mitchell&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Trawler Racer, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 362 U. S. 539, 549-550 (1960) (unseaworthiness); &lt;i&gt;Leathers&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Blessing,&lt;/i&gt; 105 U. S. 626, 630 (1882) (negligence), that nonfatal injuries caused by the breach of either duty are compensable, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mahnich&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Southern S. S. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 321 U. S. 96, 102-103 (1944) (unseaworthiness); &lt;i&gt;Robins Dry Dock &amp;amp; Repair Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Dahl,&lt;/i&gt; 266 U. S. 449, 457 (1925) (negligence), and that death caused by breach of the duty of seaworthiness is also compensable, &lt;i&gt;Moragne&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;States Marine Lines, Inc., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 409. Before us is the question whether death &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*814&lt;/span&gt; caused by negligence should, or must under direction of a federal statute, be treated differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than 80 years, from 1886 until 1970, all four issues were considered resolved, though the third not in the manner we have just described. The governing rule then was the rule of &lt;i&gt;The Harrisburg,&lt;/i&gt; 119 U. S. 199, 213 (1886): Although the general maritime law provides relief for injuries caused by the breach of maritime duties, it does not provide relief for wrongful death. &lt;i&gt;The Harrisburg&lt;/i&gt; said that rule was compelled by the existence of the same rule at common law, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 213-214&#151;although it acknowledged, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 205-212, that admiralty courts had held that damages for wrongful death were recoverable under maritime law, see also &lt;i&gt;Moragne, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 387-388 (listing cases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1969, however, we granted certiorari in &lt;i&gt;Moragne&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;States Marine Lines, Inc., supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; for the express purpose of considering "whether &lt;i&gt;The Harrisburg&lt;/i&gt; . . . should any longer be regarded as acceptable law." 398 U. S., at 375&#151; 376. We inquired whether the rule of &lt;i&gt;The Harrisburg&lt;/i&gt; was defensible under either the general maritime law or the policy displayed in the maritime statutes Congress had since enacted, 398 U. S., at 379-393, whether those statutes preempted judicial action overruling &lt;i&gt;The Harrisburg,&lt;/i&gt; 398 U. S., at 393-403, whether &lt;i&gt;stare decisis&lt;/i&gt; required adherence to &lt;i&gt;The Harrisburg,&lt;/i&gt; 398 U. S., at 403-405, and whether insuperable practical difficulties would accompany &lt;i&gt;The Harrisburg&lt;/i&gt; `s overruling, 398 U. S., at 405-408. Answering every question no, we overruled the case and declared a new rule of maritime law: "We . . . hold that an action does lie under general maritime law for death caused by violation of maritime duties." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 409.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have noted in an earlier opinion, the wrongful-death rule of &lt;i&gt;Moragne&lt;/i&gt; was not limited to any particular maritime duty, &lt;i&gt;Yamaha Motor Corp., U. S. A.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Calhoun,&lt;/i&gt; 516 &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*815&lt;/span&gt; U. S. 199, 214, n. 11 (1996) (dictum), but &lt;i&gt;Moragne&lt;/i&gt; `s facts were limited to the duty of seaworthiness, and so the issue of wrongful death for negligence has remained technically open. We are able to find no rational basis, however, for distinguishing negligence from seaworthiness. It is no less a distinctively maritime duty than seaworthiness: The common-law duties of care have not been adopted and retained unmodified by admiralty, but have been adjusted to fit their maritime context, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kermarec&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Compagnie Generale Transatlantique,&lt;/i&gt; 358 U. S. 625, 630-632 (1959), and a century ago the maritime law exchanged the common law's rule of contributory negligence for one of comparative negligence, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., The Max Morris,&lt;/i&gt; 137 U. S. 1, 14-15 (1890); &lt;i&gt;Pope &amp;amp; Talbot, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hawn,&lt;/i&gt; 346 U. S. 406, 408-409 (1953). Consequently the "tensions and discrepancies" in our precedent arising "from the necessity to accommodate state remedial statutes to exclusively maritime substantive concepts"&#151;which ultimately drove this Court in &lt;i&gt;Moragne&lt;/i&gt; to abandon &lt;i&gt;The Harrisburg,&lt;/i&gt; see 398 U. S., at 401&#151;were no less pronounced with maritime negligence than with unseaworthiness. In fact, both cases cited by &lt;i&gt;Moragne&lt;/i&gt; to exemplify those discrepancies involved maritime &lt;i&gt;negligence,&lt;/i&gt; see &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; (citing &lt;i&gt;Hess&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 361 U. S. 314 (1960); &lt;i&gt;Goett&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Union Carbide Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 361 U. S. 340 (1960) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt; ); see also &lt;i&gt;Nelson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 639 F. 2d 469, 473 (CA9 1980) (opinion by then-Judge Kennedy) (concluding that uniformity concerns required &lt;i&gt;Moragne&lt;/i&gt; `s application to negligence). It is true, as petitioner observes, that we have held admiralty accommodation of state remedial statutes to be constitutionally permissible, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Western Fuel Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Garcia,&lt;/i&gt; 257 U. S. 233, 242 (1921); &lt;i&gt;The Tungus&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Skovgaard,&lt;/i&gt; 358 U. S. 588, 594 (1959),&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; but that does not resolve &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*816&lt;/span&gt; the issue here: whether &lt;i&gt;requiring&lt;/i&gt; such an accommodation by refusing to recognize a federal remedy is preferable as a matter of maritime policy. We think it is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice-of-law anomaly occasioned by providing a federal remedy for injury but not death is no less strange when the duty breached is negligence than when it is seaworthiness. Of two victims injured at the same instant in the same location by the same negligence, only one would be covered by federal law, provided only that the other died of his injuries. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Byrd&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Napoleon Avenue Ferry Co.,&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/laed/8enP/byrd-v-napoleon-avenue-ferry-company/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;125&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;573&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 578 (ED La. 1954) (in case involving single car accident on ferry, applying state negligence law to claim for deceased husband's wrongful death but federal maritime negligence law to claim for surviving wife's injuries), aff'd, 227 F. 2d 958 (CA5 1955) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam).&lt;/i&gt; And cutting off the law's remedy at the death of the injured person is no less "a striking departure from the result dictated by elementary principles in the law of remedies," &lt;i&gt;Moragne&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;States Marine Lines, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 398 U. S., at 381, when the duty breached is negligence than when it is seaworthiness. "Where existing law imposes a primary duty, violations of which are compensable if they cause injury, nothing in ordinary notions of justice suggests that a violation should be nonactionable simply because it was serious enough to cause death." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Finally, the maritime policy favoring recovery for wrongful death that &lt;i&gt;Moragne&lt;/i&gt; found implicit in federal statutory law cannot be limited to unseaworthiness, for both of the federal Acts on which &lt;i&gt;Moragne&lt;/i&gt; relied permit recovery for negligence, see Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. &#167; 688(a); Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA), 46 U. S. C. App. &#167; 761 &lt;i&gt;et seq.;&lt;/i&gt; see also &lt;i&gt;Engel&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Davenport,&lt;/i&gt; 271 U. S. 33, 36-37 (1926) (Jones Act). In sum, a negligent breach of a maritime duty of care being assumed &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*817&lt;/span&gt; by the posture of this case,&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; no rational basis within the maritime law exists for denying respondent the recovery recognized by &lt;i&gt;Moragne&lt;/i&gt; for the death of her son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weightier arguments against recognizing a wrongfuldeath action for negligence may be found not within general maritime law but without, in the federal statutes that provide remedies for injuries and death suffered in admiralty. As we explained in &lt;i&gt;Miles&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Apex Marine Corp.,&lt;/i&gt;  498 U. S. 19, 27 (1990), "[w]e no longer live in an era when seamen and their loved ones must look primarily to the courts as a source of substantive legal protection from injury and death; Congress . . . [has] legislated extensively in these areas." And, even in admiralty, "we have no authority to substitute our views for those expressed by Congress in a duly enacted statute." &lt;i&gt;Mobil Oil Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Higginbotham,&lt;/i&gt;  436 U. S. 618, 626 (1978). Hence, when a statute resolves a particular issue, we have held that the general maritime law must comply with that resolution. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dooley&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Korean Air Lines Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 524 U. S. 116, 123-124 (1998). We must therefore make careful study of the three statutes relevant here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. &#167; 688(a), establishes a cause of action for negligence for injuries or death suffered in the course of employment, but only for seamen. See generally &lt;i&gt;Chandris, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Latsis,&lt;/i&gt; 515 U. S. 347 (1995) (describing test for seaman status). Respondent's son, who was not a seaman, was not covered by the Jones Act, and we have held that the Jones Act bears no implication for actions brought &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*818&lt;/span&gt; by nonseamen. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;American Export Lines, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Alvez,&lt;/i&gt; 446 U. S. 274, 282-283 (1980). Moreover, even as to seamen, we have held that general maritime law may provide wrongful-death actions predicated on duties beyond those that the Jones Act imposes. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Miles&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Apex Marine Corp., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 28-30 (seaworthiness). The Jones Act does not preclude respondent's negligence action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOHSA creates wrongful-death actions for negligence and unseaworthiness, see &lt;i&gt;Moragne, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 395, but only by the personal representatives of people killed "beyond a marine league from the shore of any State," 46 U. S. C. App. &#167; 761. Respondent's son was killed in state territorial waters, where DOHSA expressly provides that its provisions "shall . . . [not] apply," &#167; 767. In &lt;i&gt;Moragne,&lt;/i&gt; after discussing the anomalies that would result if DOHSA were interpreted to preclude federal maritime causes of action even where its terms do not apply, 398 U. S., at 395-396, we held that DOHSA "was not intended to preclude the availability of a remedy for wrongful death under general maritime law in situations not covered by the Act," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 402. Or, "[t]o put it another way, . . . no intention appears that the Act have the effect of foreclosing any nonstatutory federal remedies that might be found appropriate to effectuate the policies of general maritime law." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 400. DOHSA therefore does not pre-empt respondent's negligence action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), 44 Stat. 1424, as amended, 33 U. S. C. &#167; 901 &lt;i&gt;et seq.,&lt;/i&gt; provides nonseaman maritime workers such as respondent's son, see &#167; 902(3) (defining covered employees), with no-fault workers' compensation claims (against their employer, &#167; 904(b)) and negligence claims (against the vessel, &#167; 905(b)) for injury and death. As to those two defendants, the LHWCA expressly pre-empts all other claims, &#167;&#167; 905(a), (b); but cf. &lt;i&gt;Sun Ship, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pennsylvania,&lt;/i&gt; 447 U. S. 715, 723-726 (1980) (holding some state workers' compensation claims against employer &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; pre-empted), but it expressly &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*819&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;preserves&lt;/i&gt; all claims against third parties, &#167;&#167; 933(a), (i). And petitioner is a third party: It neither employed respondent's son nor owned the vessel on which he was killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner argues, however, that &#167; 933's preservation-ofother-claims provisions express Congress's intent to reserve all other wrongful-death actions to the States. That argument cannot withstand our precedent, since we have consistently interpreted &#167; 933 to preserve federal maritime claims as well as state claims, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seas Shipping Co.&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Sieracki,&lt;/i&gt; 328 U. S. 85, 100-102 (1946); &lt;i&gt;Cooper Stevedoring Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Fritz Kopke, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 417 U. S. 106, 113 (1974), including maritime negligence claims, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pope &amp;amp; Talbot, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hawn,&lt;/i&gt; 346 U. S., at 411-413 (upholding recovery for negligence under maritime law by longshoreman covered by the LHWCA). Petitioner's further contention&#151;that the policy implicit in the 1972 amendments to the LHWCA bars a maritime action for wrongful death though the text of those amendments (which left &#167; 933 unchanged) permits it&#151;cannot succeed. We do not find, as petitioner does, an anti-maritime-wrongful-death policy implicit in the amendment to &#167; 905(b), see 86 Stat. 1263, which eliminated covered workers' unseaworthiness claims against a vessel, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bloomer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 445 U. S. 74, 83 (1980) ("Congress abolished the unseaworthiness remedy for longshoremen, recognized in &lt;i&gt;Seas Shipping Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sieracki,&lt;/i&gt;  328 U. S. 85 (1946)"). That amendment was directed not at wrongful death in particular, but at unseaworthiness generally, see &lt;i&gt;Edmonds&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Compagnie Generale Transatlantique,&lt;/i&gt; 443 U. S. 256, 262 (1979) ("Congress acted in 1972, among other things, to eliminate the shipowner's liability to the longshoreman for unseaworthiness . . .&#151;in other words, to overrule &lt;i&gt;Sieracki&lt;/i&gt; "). To the extent the amendment to &#167; 905(b) reflects any policy relevant here, it is in expressly ratifying longshore and harbor workers' claims against the vessel for &lt;i&gt;negligence,&lt;/i&gt; see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 259-260. The LHWCA therefore does not preclude this negligence action for wrongful death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*820&lt;/span&gt; Ginsburg, J., concurring in part&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even beyond the express pre-emptive reach of federal maritime statutes, however, we have acknowledged that they contain a further prudential effect. "While there is an established and continuing tradition of federal common lawmaking in admiralty, that law is to be developed, insofar as possible, to harmonize with the enactments of Congress in the field." &lt;i&gt;American Dredging Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Miller,&lt;/i&gt; 510 U. S. 443, 455 (1994). Cf. &lt;i&gt;Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S. A.&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Alliance Bond Fund, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 527 U. S. 308, 332-333 (1999) (equitable lawmaking power of bankruptcy courts limited by statute). Because of Congress's extensive involvement in legislating causes of action for maritime personal injuries, it will be the better course, in many cases that assert new claims beyond what those statutes have seen fit to allow, to leave further development to Congress. The cause of action we recognize today, however, is new only in the most technical sense. The general maritime law has recognized the tort of negligence for more than a century, and it has been clear since &lt;i&gt;Moragne&lt;/i&gt; that breaches of a maritime duty are actionable when they cause death, as when they cause injury. Congress's occupation of this field is not yet so extensive as to preclude us from recognizing what is already logically compelled by our precedents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maritime cause of action that &lt;i&gt;Moragne&lt;/i&gt; established for unseaworthiness is equally available for negligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Souter and Justice Breyer join, concurring in part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I join all but Part II&#151;B-2 of the Court's opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the reasoning in &lt;i&gt;Moragne&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;States Marine Lines, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 398 U. S. 375 (1970), the Court today holds that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*821&lt;/span&gt; the maritime cause of action &lt;i&gt;Moragne&lt;/i&gt; established for unseaworthiness is equally available for negligence. I agree with the Court's clear opinion with one reservation. In Part II&#151;B-2, the Court counsels: "Because of Congress's extensive involvement in legislating causes of action for maritime personal injuries, it will be the better course, in many cases that assert new claims beyond what those statutes . . . allow, to leave further development to Congress." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt;  at 820. &lt;i&gt;Moragne&lt;/i&gt; itself, however, tugs in the opposite direction. Inspecting the relevant legislation, the Court in &lt;i&gt;Moragne&lt;/i&gt; found no measures counseling against the judicial elaboration of general maritime law there advanced. See 398 U. S., at 399-402, 409; see also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 393 ("Where death is caused by the breach of a duty imposed by federal maritime law, Congress has established a policy favoring recovery in the absence of a legislative direction to except a particular class of cases."). In accord with &lt;i&gt;Moragne,&lt;/i&gt; I see development of the law in admiralty as a shared venture in which "federal common lawmaking" does not stand still, but "harmonize[s] with the enactments of Congress in the field." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 820 (quoting &lt;i&gt;American Dredging Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Miller,&lt;/i&gt; 510 U. S. 443, 455 (1994)). I therefore do not join the Court's dictum&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The issue addressed in &lt;i&gt;Yamaha Motor Corp., U. S. A.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Calhoun,&lt;/i&gt; 516 U. S. 199 (1996), whether state remedies may in some instances supplement a federal maritime remedy, is not presented by this case, where respondent is no longer pursuing state remedies. After the District Court dismissed her state-law claim on jurisdictional grounds, respondent re-filed it in state court, where it was resolved against her. See Brief for Respondent 2, n. 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The District Court dismissed the case for the threshold reason that, regardless of a negligent breach, there could be no recovery. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt;  at 813. Petitioner therefore will be free to present its arguments regarding duty and breach on remand to the extent they have been preserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;No. 00-6374.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;United States Supreme Court.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued April 16, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided May 29, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*759&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*759&lt;/span&gt; Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jeffrey S. Sutton,&lt;/i&gt; by appointment of the Court, 531 U. S. 1123, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Ronald E. Laymon&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Chad A. Readler.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stewart A. Baker,&lt;/i&gt; by invitation of the Court, 531 U. S. 1110, argued the cause and filed a brief as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/i&gt;  in support of the judgment below. &lt;i&gt;Betty D. Montgomery,&lt;/i&gt;  Attorney General of Ohio, &lt;i&gt;pro se,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;David M. Gormley,&lt;/i&gt;  State Solicitor, filed a brief for respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Ginsburg, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner Dale G. Becker, an Ohio prisoner, instituted a &lt;i&gt;pro se&lt;/i&gt; civil rights action in a Federal District Court, contesting conditions of his confinement. Upon dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim for relief, Becker sought to appeal. Using a Government-printed form, Becker timely filed a notice of appeal that contained all of the requested information. On the line tagged "(Counsel for Appellant)," &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*760&lt;/span&gt; Becker typed, but did not hand sign, his own name. For want of a handwritten signature on the notice as originally filed, the Court of Appeals dismissed Becker's appeal. The appellate court deemed the defect "jurisdictional," and therefore not curable outside the time allowed to file the notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We granted review to address this question: "When a party files a timely notice of appeal in district court, does the failure to sign the notice of appeal require the court of appeals to dismiss the appeal?" 531 U. S. 1110 (2001). Our answer is no. For want of a signature on a timely notice, the appeal is not automatically lost. The governing Federal Rules direct that the notice of appeal, like other papers filed in district court, shall be signed by counsel or, if the party is unrepresented, by the party himself. But if the notice is timely filed and adequate in other respects, jurisdiction will vest in the court of appeals, where the case may proceed so long as the appellant promptly supplies the signature once the omission is called to his attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case originated from a civil rights complaint under 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1983 filed &lt;i&gt;pro se&lt;/i&gt; by Ohio prison inmate Dale G. Becker in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Becker challenged the conditions of his incarceration at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution, specifically, his exposure to second-hand cigarette smoke. The District Court dismissed Becker's complaint for failure to exhaust prison administrative remedies and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. App. 5-8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the 30 days allowed for appeal from a district court's judgment, see 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2107(a); Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1), Becker, still &lt;i&gt;pro se,&lt;/i&gt; filed a notice of appeal. Using a notice of appeal form printed by the Government Printing Office, Becker filled in the blanks, specifying himself as sole appellant, designating the judgment from which &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*761&lt;/span&gt; he appealed, and naming the court to which he appealed. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3(c)(1). He typed his own name in the space above "(Counsel for Appellant)," and also typed, in the spaces provided on the form, his address and the date of the notice. The form Becker completed contained no statement or other indication of a signature requirement and Becker did not hand sign the notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Court docketed the notice, sent a copy to the Court of Appeals, and subsequently granted Becker leave to proceed &lt;i&gt;in forma pauperis&lt;/i&gt; on appeal. Becker received a letter from the Sixth Circuit Clerk's Office telling him that his appeal had been docketed and setting a briefing schedule. The letter stated: "The court is aware that you are not an attorney and it will &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; hold you to the same standards it requires of them in stating your case." App. 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becker filed his brief more than two weeks in advance of the scheduled deadline. He signed it both on the cover and on the last page. Some six months later, on its own motion, the Sixth Circuit dismissed the appeal in a spare order relying on that court's prior, published decision in &lt;i&gt;Mattingly&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Farmers State Bank,&lt;/i&gt; 153 F. 3d 336 (1998) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; In Becker's case, the Court of Appeals said, summarily:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This court lacks jurisdiction over this appeal. The notice of appeal is defective because it was not signed by the pro se appellant or by a qualified attorney." App. 16-17.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No court officer had earlier called Becker's attention to the need for a signature, and the dismissal order, issued long after the 30-day time to appeal expired, accorded Becker no opportunity to cure the defect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becker filed a timely but unsuccessful motion for reconsideration, to which he appended a new, signed notice of appeal. Thereafter, he petitioned for this Court's review. The Attorney General of Ohio, in response, urged us "to summarily &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*762&lt;/span&gt; reverse the judgment below," Brief in Response to Pet. for Cert. 1, stating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We cannot honestly claim any uncertain[t]y about petitioner Becker's intention to pursue an appeal once he filed his timely, though unsigned, notice of appeal in the district court. We never objected to the lack of a signature on his notice of appeal, and fully expected the court of appeals to address his appellate arguments on the merits." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 5.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We granted certiorari, 531 U. S. 1069; 531 U. S. 1110 (2001), to assure the uniform interpretation of the governing Federal Rules, and now address the question whether Becker's failure to sign his timely filed notice of appeal requires the Court of Appeals to dismiss his appeal.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Mattingly&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Farmers State Bank,&lt;/i&gt; 153 F. 3d 336 (1998) &lt;i&gt;(per curiam)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; the Sixth Circuit determined that a notice of appeal must be signed, and that a signature's omission cannot be cured by giving the appellant an opportunity to sign after the time to appeal has expired. For this determination, that court relied on the complementary operation of two Federal Rules: Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure (Appellate Rule) 4(a)(1), which provides that "the notice of appeal required by Rule 3 [to commence an appeal] must be filed with the district clerk within 30 days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered";&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; and Federal Rule of Civil &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*763&lt;/span&gt; Procedure (Civil Rule) 11(a), which provides that "[e]very . . . paper [filed in a district court] shall be signed." We agree with the Sixth Circuit that the governing Federal Rules call for a signature on notices of appeal. We disagree, however, with that court's dispositive ruling that the signature requirement cannot be met after the appeal period expires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civil Rule 11(a), the source of the signature requirement, comes into play on appeal this way. An appeal can be initiated, Appellate Rule 3(a)(1) instructs, "only by filing a notice of appeal with the district clerk within the time allowed by [Appellate] Rule 4." Whenever the Appellate Rules provide for a filing in the district court, Appellate Rule 1(a)(2) directs, "the procedure must comply with the practice of the district court." The district court practice relevant here is Civil Rule 11(a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rule 11(a)'s first sentence states the signature requirement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Every pleading, written motion, and other paper shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney's individual name, or, if the party is not represented by an attorney, shall be signed by the party."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notices of appeal unquestionably qualify as "other paper[s]," so they "shall be signed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becker maintains that typing one's name satisfies the signature requirement and that his original notice of appeal, containing his name typed above "(Counsel of Record)," met Civil Rule 11(a)'s instruction. We do not doubt that the signature requirement can be adjusted to keep pace with technological advances. A 1996 amendment to Civil Rule 5 provides in this regard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A court may by local rule permit papers to be filed, signed, or verified by electronic means that are consistent &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*764&lt;/span&gt; with technical standards, if any, that the Judicial Conference of the United States establishes. A paper filed by electronic means in compliance with a local rule constitutes a written paper for the purpose of applying these rules." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 5(e).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Rule 5.1 (ND Ohio 2000) (permitting "papers filed, signed, or verified by electronic means"). The local rules on electronic filing provide some assurance, as does a handwritten signature, that the submission is authentic. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Electronic Filing Policies and Procedures Manual 4 (Apr. 2, 2001) (available at http://www.ohnd.uscourts.gov/ Electronic Filing/user.pdf) (allowing only registered attorneys assigned identification names and passwords to file papers electronically). Without any rule change so ordering, however, we are not disposed to extend the meaning of the word "signed," as that word appears in Civil Rule 11(a), to permit typed names. As Rule 11(a) is now framed, we read the requirement of a signature to indicate, as a signature requirement commonly does, and as it did in John Hancock's day, a name handwritten (or a mark handplaced).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As plainly as Civil Rule 11(a) requires a signature on filed papers, however, so the rule goes on to provide in its final sentence that "omission of the signature" may be "corrected promptly after being called to the attention of the attorney or party." "Correction can be made," the Rules Advisory Committee noted, "by signing the paper on file or by submitting a duplicate that contains the signature." Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 666.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Amicus&lt;/i&gt; urges that only the first sentence of Civil Rule 11(a), containing the signature requirement&#151;not Rule 11(a)'s final sentence, providing for correction of a signature omission&#151;applies to appeal notices. Appellate Rule 1(a)(2)'s direction &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*765&lt;/span&gt; to "comply with the practice of the district court" ceases to hold sway, &lt;i&gt;amicus&lt;/i&gt; maintains, once the notice of appeal is transmitted from the district court, in which it is filed, to the court of appeals, in which the case will proceed. Brief for &lt;i&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/i&gt; in Support of the Judgment Below 15-18, and nn. 18-20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civil Rule 11(a), in our view, cannot be sliced as &lt;i&gt;amicus&lt;/i&gt;  proposes. The rule was formulated and should be applied as a cohesive whole. So understood, the signature requirement and the cure for an initial failure to meet the requirement go hand in hand. The remedy for a signature omission, in other words, is part and parcel of the requirement itself. Becker proffered a correction of the defect in his notice in the manner Rule 11(a) permits&#151;he attempted to submit a duplicate containing his signature, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 761&#151;and therefore should not have suffered dismissal of his appeal for nonobservance of that rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sixth Circuit in &lt;i&gt;Mattingly&lt;/i&gt; correctly observed that we have described Appellate Rules 3 and 4 as "jurisdictional in nature." 153 F. 3d, at 337 (citing &lt;i&gt;Torres&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Oakland Scavenger Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 487 U. S. 312, 315 (1988), and &lt;i&gt;Smith&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Barry,&lt;/i&gt; 502 U. S. 244, 248 (1992)). We do not today hold otherwise. We rule simply and only that Becker's lapse was curable as Civil Rule 11(a) prescribes; his initial omission was not a "jurisdictional" impediment to pursuit of his appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appellate Rules 3 and 4, we clarify, are indeed linked jurisdictional provisions. Rule 3(a)(1) directs that a notice of appeal be filed "within the time allowed by Rule 4," &lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; ordinarily, within 30 days after the judgment appealed from is entered, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 762-763, and n. 2. Rule 3(c)(1) details what the notice of appeal must contain: The notice, within Rule 4's time frame, must (1) specify the party or parties taking the appeal; (2) designate the judgment from which the appeal is taken; and (3) name the court to which &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*766&lt;/span&gt; the appeal is taken.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Notably, a signature requirement is not among Rule 3(c)(1)'s specifications, for Civil Rule 11(a) alone calls for and controls that requirement and renders it nonjurisdictional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Amicus&lt;/i&gt; ultimately urges that even if there is no jurisdictional notice of appeal signature requirement for parties represented by attorneys, &lt;i&gt;pro se&lt;/i&gt; parties, like Becker, must sign within Rule 4's timeline to avoid automatic dismissal. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 34-36. Appellate Rule 3(c)(2) is the foundation for this argument. That provision reads: "A pro se notice of appeal is considered filed on behalf of the signer and the signer's spouse and minor children (if they are parties), unless the notice clearly indicates otherwise."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not agree that Rule 3(c)(2)'s prescription, added in 1993 to a then unsubdivided Rule 3(c), see Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 590, places &lt;i&gt;pro se&lt;/i&gt; litigants in a singularly exacting time bind. The provision, as we read it, does not dislodge the signature requirement from its Civil Rule 11(a) moorings and make of it an Appellate Rule 3 jurisdictional specification. The current Rule 3(c)(2), like other changes made in 1993, the Advisory Committee Notes explain, was designed "to prevent the loss of a right to appeal through inadvertent omission of a party's name" when "it is objectively clear that [the] party intended to appeal." Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 590. Seen in this light, the Rule is entirely ameliorative; it assumes and assures that the &lt;i&gt;pro se&lt;/i&gt; litigant's spouse and minor children, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*767&lt;/span&gt; if they were parties below, will remain parties on appeal, "unless the notice clearly indicates a contrary intent." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we had any doubt that Appellate Rule 3(c)(2) was meant only to facilitate, not to impede, access to an appeal, we would find corroboration in a related ameliorative rule, Appellate Rule 3(c)(4), which provides: "An appeal must not be dismissed for informality of form or title of the notice of appeal, or for failure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice." Cf. this Court's Rule 14.5 ("If the Clerk determines that a petition submitted timely and in good faith is in a form that does not comply with this Rule [governing the content of petitions for certiorari] or with Rule 33 or Rule 34 [governing document preparation], the Clerk will return it with a letter indicating the deficiency. A corrected petition received no more than 60 days after the date of the Clerk's letter will be deemed timely.").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Torres&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Oakland Scavenger Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 487 U. S. 312 (1988), it is true, we held, that a notice of appeal that omitted the name of a particular appellant, through a clerical error, was ineffective to take an appeal for that party. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 318 (construing Rule 3(c) prior to the ameliorative changes made in 1993).&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; Becker's notice, however, did not suffer from any failure to "specify the party or parties taking the appeal." Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3(c)(1)(A). Other opinions of this Court are in full harmony with the view that imperfections in noticing an appeal should not be fatal where no genuine doubt exists about who is appealing, from what judgment, to which appellate court. See &lt;i&gt;Smith&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Barry,&lt;/i&gt; 502 U. S., at 245, 248-249 (holding that "a document intended to serve as an appellate brief [filed within the time specified by Appellate Rule 4 and containing the information required by Appellate Rule 3] may qualify as the notice of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*768&lt;/span&gt; appeal"); &lt;i&gt;Foman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Davis,&lt;/i&gt; 371 U. S. 178, 181 (1962) (holding that an appeal was improperly dismissed when the record as a whole&#151;including a timely but incomplete notice of appeal and a premature but complete notice&#151;revealed the orders petitioner sought to appeal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, the Federal Rules require a notice of appeal to be signed. That requirement derives from Civil Rule 11(a), and so does the remedy for a signature's omission on the notice originally filed. On the facts here presented, the Sixth Circuit should have accepted Becker's corrected notice as perfecting his appeal. We therefore reverse the judgment dismissing Becker's appeal and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Without any party to defend the Sixth Circuit's position, we invited Stewart A. Baker to brief and argue this case, as &lt;i&gt;amicus curiae,&lt;/i&gt; in support of the judgment below. 531 U. S.1110 (2001). His able representation,and that of Jeffrey S. Sutton, whom we appointed to represent Becker, 531 U. S. 1123 (2001), permit us to decide this case satisfied that the relevant issues have been fully aired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  On motion filed no later than 30 days after expiration of the original appeal time, the appeal period may be extended upon a showing of "excusable neglect or good cause," but the extension "may [not]exceed 30 days after the [originally] prescribed time or 10 days after the date when the order granting the motion is entered, whichever is later."Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Appellate Rule 3(c)(1), as currently framed, provides in full:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(1) The notice of appeal must:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(A) specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming each one in the caption or body of the notice, but an attorney representing more than one party may describe those parties with such terms as `all plaintiffs,' `the defendants,' `the plaintiffs A, B, et al.,' or `all defendants except X';&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(B) designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(C) name the court to which the appeal is taken."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  The Advisory Committee intended the elaborate 1993 amendment of Appellate Rule 3(c) "to reduce the amount of satellite litigation spawned by &lt;i&gt;[Torres]&lt;/i&gt; ." Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 590.&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*824&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*824&lt;/span&gt; Souter, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 838. Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 839.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eric R. Fox&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs was &lt;i&gt;Alan J. J. Swirski.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kent L. Jones&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Acting Solicitor General Underwood, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Fallon, Deputy Solicitor General Wallace, Richard Farber,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Edward T. Perelmuter.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Souter, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under &#167; 172(b)(1)(I) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, a taxpayer may carry back its "product liability loss" up to 10 years in order to offset prior years' income. The issue here is the method for calculating the product liability loss of an affiliated group of corporations electing to file a consolidated federal income tax return. We hold that the group's product liability loss must be figured on a consolidated basis in the first instance, and not by aggregating product liability losses separately determined company by company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*825&lt;/span&gt; I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A "net operating loss" results from deductions in excess of gross income for a given year. 26 U. S. C. &#167; 172(c).&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Under &#167; 172(b)(1)(A), a taxpayer may carry its net operating loss either backward to past tax years or forward to future tax years in order to "set off its lean years against its lush years, and to strike something like an average taxable income computed over a period longer than one year," &lt;i&gt;Libson Shops, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Koehler,&lt;/i&gt; 353 U. S. 382, 386 (1957).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the normal carry back period was at the time three years, in 1978, Congress authorized a special 10year carry back for "product liability loss[es]," 26 U. S. C. &#167; 172(b)(1)(I), since, it understood, losses of this sort tend to be particularly "large and sporadic." Joint Committee on Taxation, General Explanation of the Revenue Act of 1978, 95th Cong., 232 (Comm. Print 1979). The Code defines "product liability loss," for a given tax year, as the lesser of (1) the taxpayer's "net operating loss for such year" and (2) its allowable deductions attributable to product liability "expenses." 26 U. S. C. &#167; 172(j)(1). In other words, a taxpayer's product liability loss (PLL) is the total of its product liability expenses (PLEs), limited to the amount of its net operating loss (NOL). By definition, then, a taxpayer with positive annual income, and thus no NOL, may have PLEs but can have no PLL.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*826&lt;/span&gt; Instead of requiring each member company of "[a]n affiliated group of corporations" to file a separate tax return, the Code permits the group to file a single consolidated return, 26 U. S. C. &#167; 1501, and leaves it to the Secretary of the Treasury to work out the details by promulgating regulations governing such returns, &#167; 1502. Under Treas. Regs. &#167;&#167; 1.1502-11(a) and 1.1502-21(f),&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; an affiliated group's "consolidated taxable income" (CTI), or, alternatively, its "consolidated net operating loss" (CNOL), is determined by "taking into account" several items. The first is the "separate taxable income" (STI) of each group member. A member's STI (whether positive or negative) is computed as though the member were a separate corporation (&lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; by netting income and expenses), but subject to several important "modifications." Treas. Reg. &#167; 1.1502-12. These modifications require a group member calculating its STI to disregard, among other items, its capital gains and losses, charitable-contribution deductions, and dividends-received deductions. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; These excluded items are accounted for on a consolidated basis, that is, they are combined at the level of the group filing the single return, where deductions otherwise attributable to one member (say, for a charitable contribution) can offset income received by another (from a capital gain, for example). Treas. Regs. &#167;&#167; 1.1502-11(a)(3) to (8); 1.1502-21(f)(2) to (6). A consolidated group's CTI or CNOL, therefore, is the sum of each member's STI, plus or minus a handful of items considered on a consolidated basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner United Dominion's predecessor in interest, AMCA International Corporation, was the parent of an affiliated group of corporations that properly elected to file &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*827&lt;/span&gt; consolidated tax returns for the years 1983 through 1986. In each of these years, AMCA reported CNOL (the lowest being $85 million and the highest, $140 million) that exceeded the aggregate of its 26 individual members' PLEs ($3.5 million to $6.5 million). This case focuses on the PLEs of five of AMCA's member companies, which, together, generated roughly $205,000 in PLEs in 1983, $1.6 million in 1984, $1.3 million in 1985, and $250,000 in 1986. No one disputes these amounts or their characterization as PLEs. See 208 F. 3d 452, 453 (CA4 2000) ("The parties agree" with respect to the amount of "the product liability expenses incurred by the five group members in the relevant years"). Rather, the sole question here is whether the AMCA affiliated group may include these amounts on its consolidated return, in determining its PLL for 10-year carry back. The question arises because of the further undisputed fact that in each of the relevant tax years, each of the five companies in question (with minor exceptions not relevant here), reported a positive STI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMCA answered this question by following what commentators have called a "single-entity" approach&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; to calculating its "consolidated" PLL. For each tax year, AMCA (1) calculated its CNOL pursuant to Treas. Reg. &#167; 1.1502&#151; 11(a), and (2) aggregated its individual members' PLEs. Because, as noted above, for each tax year AMCA's CNOL was greater than the sum of its members' PLEs, AMCA treated the full amount of the PLEs as consolidated PLL eligible for 10-year carry back. In AMCA's view, the fact that several member companies throwing off large PLEs also, when considered separately, generated positive taxable income was of no significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Government's perspective, however, the fact that the several affiliated members with PLEs also generated &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*828&lt;/span&gt; positive separate taxable income is of critical significance. According to the Government's methodology, which we will call the "separate-member" approach,&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; PLEs incurred by an affiliate with positive separate taxable income cannot contribute to a PLL eligible for 10-year carryback. Whereas AMCA compares the group's total income (or loss) and total PLEs in an effort to determine the group's total PLL, the Government compares each affiliate's STI and PLEs in order to determine whether each affiliate suffers a PLL, and only then combines any PLLs of the individual affiliates to determine a consolidated PLL amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1986 and 1987, AMCA petitioned the Internal Revenue Service for refunds of taxes based on its PLL calculations. The IRS first ruled in AMCA's favor but was reversed by the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation of the United States Congress, which controls refunds exceeding a certain threshold, 26 U. S. C. &#167; 6405(a). AMCA then filed this refund action in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. The District Court agreed with AMCA that an affiliated group's PLL is determined on a single-entity basis, and held that, so long as the group's consolidated return reflects CNOL in excess of the group's aggregate PLEs, the total of those expenses (including those incurred by members with positive separate taxable income) is a PLL that "may be carried back the full ten years." No. 3:95&#151;CV-341&#151;MU (June 19, 1998), App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, and held that "determining `product liability loss' separately for each group member is correct and consistent with [Treasury] regulations." 208 F. 3d, at 458.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the Fourth Circuit's separate-member approach to calculating PLL conflicted with the Sixth Circuit's adoption of the single-entity approach in &lt;i&gt;Intermet Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Com-&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*829&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;missioner,&lt;/i&gt; 209 F. 3d 901 (2000), we granted certiorari, 531 U. S. 1009 (2000).&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; We now reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case for the single-entity approach to calculating an affiliated group's PLL is straightforward. Section 172(j)(1) defines a taxpayer's "product liability loss" for a given tax year as the lesser of its "net operating loss for such year" and its product liability "expenses." In order to apply this definition, the taxpayer first determines whether it has taxable income or NOL, and in making that calculation it subtracts PLEs. If the result is NOL, the taxpayer then makes a simple comparison between the NOL figure and the total PLEs. The PLE total becomes the PLL to the extent it does not exceed NOL. That is, until NOL has been determined, there is no PLL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in applying the definition and methodology of PLL to a taxpayer filing a consolidated return thus requires the calculation of NOL. As United Dominion correctly points out, the Code and regulations governing affiliated groups of corporations filing consolidated returns provide only one definition of NOL: "consolidated" NOL, see Treas. Reg. &#167; 1.1502-21(f). There is no definition of separate NOL for a member of an affiliated group. Indeed, the fact that Treasury Regulations do provide a measure of separate NOL in a different context, for an affiliated corporation as to any year in which it filed a separate return, &lt;i&gt;infra,&lt;/i&gt; at 832&#151; 834, underscores the absence of such a measure for an affiliated &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*830&lt;/span&gt; corporation filing as a group member. Given this apparently exclusive definition of NOL as CNOL in the instance of affiliated entities with a consolidated return (and for reasons developed below, &lt;i&gt;infra,&lt;/i&gt; at 834-838) we think it is fair to say, as United Dominion says, that the concept of separate NOL "simply does not exist." Brief for Petitioner 15.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; The exclusiveness of NOL at the consolidated level as CNOL is important here for the following reasons. The Code's authorization of consolidated group treatment contains no indication that for a consolidated group the essential relationship between NOL and PLL will differ from their relationship for a conventional corporate taxpayer. Nor does any Treasury Regulation purport to change the relationship in the consolidated context. If, then, the relationship is to remain essentially the same, the key to understanding it lies in the regulations' definition of net operating loss exclusively at the consolidated level. Working back from that, PLEs should be considered first in calculating CNOL, and they are: because any PLE of an affiliate affects the calculation of its STI, that same PLE necessarily affects the CTI or CNOL in exactly the same way, dollar for dollar. And because, by definition, there is no NOL measure for a consolidated return group or any affiliate except CNOL, PLEs cannot be compared with any NOL to produce PLL until CNOL has been calculated. Then, and only then in the case of the consolidated filer, can total PLEs be compared &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*831&lt;/span&gt; with a net operating loss. In sum, comparable treatment of PLL in the instances of the usual corporate taxpayer and group filing a consolidated return can be achieved only if the comparison of PLEs with a limiting loss amount occurs at the consolidated level after CNOL has been determined. This approach resting on comparable treatment has a further virtue entitled to some weight in case of doubt: it is (relatively) easy to understand and to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case for the separate-member approach, advanced (in one variant) by the Government and adopted (on a different rationale) by the Court of Appeals, is not so easily made. In the analysis of comparable treatment just set out, of course, there is no NOL below the consolidated level and hence nothing for comparison with PLEs to produce PLL at any stage before the CNOL calculation. At the least, then, a proponent of the separate-member approach must identify some figure in the consolidated return scheme that could have a plausible analogy to NOL at the level of the affiliated corporations. See A. Dubroff, J. Blanchard, J. Broadbent, &amp;amp; K. Duvall, Federal Income Taxation of Corporations Filing Consolidated Returns &#167; 41.04[06], p. 41-75 (2d ed. 2000) (hereinafter Dubroff) ("Even if separate entity treatment was appropriate, it is unclear how a member with [PLEs] would compute its separate NOL"). The Government and the Court of Appeals have suggested different substitute measures. Neither one works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government has argued that an individual group member's STI, as determined under Treas. Reg. &#167; 1.1502-12, is analogous to a "separate" NOL, so that an affiliate's STI may be compared with its PLEs in order to determine any separate PLL. An individual member's PLL would be the amount of its separate PLEs up to the amount of its negative STI; a member having positive STI could have no PLL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government claims that an STI-based comparison places the group member closest to the position it would have occupied if it had filed a separate return. But that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*832&lt;/span&gt; is simply not so. We have seen already that the calculation of a group member's STI by definition excludes several items that an individual taxpayer would normally account for in computing income or loss, but which an affiliated group may tally only at the consolidated level, such as capital gains and losses, charitable-contribution deductions, and dividends-received deductions. Treas. Regs. &#167;&#167; 1.1502-12(j) to (n). Owing to these exclusions, an affiliate's STI will tend to be inflated by eliminating deductions it would have taken if it had filed separately, or deflated by eliminating an income item like capital gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When pushed, the Government concedes that STI is "not necessarily equivalent to the income or [NOL] figure that the corporation would have computed if it had filed a separate return." Brief for United States 21, n. 14. But, the Government claims, "[t]here has never been a taxpayer with [PLEs] who had a positive [STI] but a negative separate [NOL]." Tr. of Oral Arg. 27. In other words, the Government says that the deductions excluded from STI have never once made a difference and, therefore, that STI is, in fact, a decent enough proxy for a group member's "separate" NOL. But whether or not the excluded items have made a difference in the past, or make a difference here, they certainly could make a difference and, given the potential importance of some of the deductions involved (a large charitable contribution, for example), it is not hard to see how the difference could favor the Government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals was therefore right to reject the Government's reliance on STI as a functional surrogate for an affiliate's "separate" NOL. 208 F. 3d, at 459-460. But what the Court of Appeals used in place of STI fares no better. The court relied on Treas. Reg. &#167; 1.1502-79, which contains a definition of "separate net operating loss" that the court believed to be "analogous to an individual's `net operating loss' on a separate return." 208 F. 3d, at 460. Section 1.1502-79(a)(3) provides that, "[f]or purposes of this &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*833&lt;/span&gt; subparagraph," the "separate net operating loss of a member of the group shall be determined under &#167; 1.1502-12 . . . , adjusted for the . . . items taken into account in the computation of" the CNOL. As the Court of Appeals said, the directive of &#167; 1.1502-79(a)(3) (unlike the definition of STI) "takes into account, for example, [a] member's charitable contributions" and other consolidated deductions. 208 F. 3d, at 460-461.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this sounds too good. It is true that, insofar as &#167; 1.1502-79(a)(3) accounts for gains and losses that STI does not, it gets closer to a commonsense notion of a group member's "separate" NOL than STI does. But the fact that &#167; 1.1502-79(a)(3) improves on STI simply by undoing what &#167; 1.1502-12 requires in defining STI is suspicious, and the suspicion turns out to be justified. Section 1.1502-79(a)(3) unbakes the cake for only one reason, and that reason has no application here. The definition on which the Court of Appeals relied applies, by its terms, only "for purposes of" &#167; 1.1502-79(a)(3), and context makes clear that the purpose is to provide a way to allocate CNOL to an affiliate member that seeks to carry back a loss to a "separate return year," that is, to a year in which the member was not part of the consolidated group. See Treas. Reg. &#167; 1.1502-79 (titled "Separate return years"); &#167; 1.1502-79(a) (titled "Carryover and carryback of [CNOL] to separate return years"); &#167; 1.1502-79(a)(1) ("[i]f a [CNOL] can be carried . . . to a separate return year . . ."). No separate return years are at issue before us; all NOL carrybacks relevant here apply to years in which the five corporations were affiliated in the group. The Court of Appeals thus applied concepts addressing separate return years to a determination for a consolidated return year, without any statutory or regulatory basis for doing so. Cf. 49 Fed. Reg. 30530 (1984) ("[A]lthough the consolidated net operating loss is apportioned to individual members for purposes of carry backs to separate return years [under &#167; 1.1502-79(a)], the apportioned amounts are not &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*834&lt;/span&gt; separate NOLs of each member"). Hence, while &#167; 1.1502-79 might not distort an affiliate's separate NOL in the same way that STI does, the facial inapplicability of that regulation only underscores the exclusive concern of &#167; 1.1502-11(a) with consolidated NOL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, neither method for computing PLL on a separatemember basis squares with the notion of comparability as applied to consolidated return regulations. On the contrary, by expressly and exclusively defining NOL as CNOL, the regulations support the position that group members' PLEs should be aggregated and the affiliated group's PLL determined on a consolidated, single-entity basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several objections have been raised to a single-entity approach to calculating PLL that we have not considered yet. First, the Government insists that a single-entity rule allows affiliated groups a "double deduction." The Government argues that because PLEs are not included among the specific items (charitable-contribution deductions, etc.) for which consolidated, single-entity treatment is required under Treas. Reg. &#167; 1.1502-12, PLEs are "consumed" or "used up" in computing members' STIs, which, pursuant to Treas. Regs. &#167;&#167; 1.1502-11(a) and 1.1502-21(f), are then used to calculate the group's CTI or CNOL. According to the Government, to permit the use of PLEs first to reduce an individual member's STI and then to contribute to an aggregate PLL for carryback purposes would be tantamount to a double deduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The double-deduction argument may have superficial appeal, but any appeal it has rests on a fundamental misconception of the function of STI in computing an affiliated group's tax liability. Calculation of a group member's STI is not in and of itself the basis for any tax event, and there is no separate tax saving when STI is calculated; that occurs only when deductions on the consolidated return equal income &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*835&lt;/span&gt; and (if they exceed income and produce a CNOL) are carried back against prior income. STI is merely an accounting construct devised as an interim step in computing a group's CTI or CNOL; it "has no other purpose." &lt;i&gt;Intermet,&lt;/i&gt; 209 F. 3d, at 906 ("A member's STI is simply a step along the way to calculating the group's taxable income or CNOL"). The fact that a group member's PLEs reduce its STI, which in turn either reduces the group's CTI or contributes to its CNOL "dollar for dollar," &lt;i&gt;ibid.,&lt;/i&gt; is of no other moment.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; If there were anything wrong in what United Dominion proposes to do, it would be wrong in relation to CNOL and its use for any carryback. Yet, as noted above, no one here disputes that the group members had PLEs in the total amount claimed or that the AMCA group is entitled to carry back the full amount of its CNOL to offset income in prior years. The only question is what portion, if any, of AMCA's CNOL is PLL and, as such, eligible for 10-year, as opposed to 3-year, carryback treatment. There is no more of a double deduction with a 10-year carryback than one for three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second objection was the reason that the Court of Appeals rejected the single-entity approach. That court attached dispositive significance to the fact that, while the Treasury Regulation we have discussed, &#167; 1.1502-12, specifically provides that several items (capital gains and losses, charitable-contribution deductions, etc.) shall be accounted for on a consolidated basis, it does not similarly provide for accounting for PLEs on a consolidated basis: "The regulations provide for blending the group members' [NOLs], &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*836&lt;/span&gt; and they explicitly define [CNOL] without an accompanying reference to consolidated [PLEs]. This omission . . . makes clear that blending those expenses is not permitted . . . ." 208 F. 3d, at 458.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think the omission of PLEs from the series of items that &#167; 1.1502-12 requires to be tallied at the consolidated level has no such clear lesson, however. The logic that invests the omission with significance is familiar: the mention of some implies the exclusion of others not mentioned. &lt;i&gt;Leatherman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit,&lt;/i&gt; 507 U. S. 163, 168 (1993) &lt;i&gt;("Expressio unius est exclusio alterius")&lt;/i&gt; . But here, as always, the soundness of that premise is a function of timing: if there was a good reason to consider the treatment of consolidated PLL at the time the regulation was drawn, then omitting PLL from the list of items for consolidated treatment may well have meant something. But if there was no reason to consider PLL then, its omission would mean nothing at all. And in fact there was no reason. When the consolidated return regulations were first promulgated in 1966, there was no carryback provision pegged to PLEs or PLLs; those notions did not become separate carryback items until 1978, when the 10-year rule was devised. See Revenue Act of 1978, &#167; 371, 92 Stat. 2859; see also Leatherman, Current Developments 393, n. 5. Omission of PLEs or PLLs from the series set out for consolidated treatment in the 1966 regulation therefore meant absolutely nothing in 1966. The issue, then, is the significance, not of omission, but of failure to include later: has the significance of the earlier regulation changed solely because the Treasury has never amended it, even though PLL is now a separate carryback? We think that is unlikely. The Treasury's relaxed approach to amending its regulations to track Code changes is well documented. See &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Dubroff 41-72, n. 193; Axelrod &amp;amp; Blank 1391; Leatherman, Separate Liability Losses 708-709. The absence of any amendment to &#167; 1.1502-12 that might have added PLEs &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*837&lt;/span&gt; or PLLs to the list of items for mandatory single-entity treatment therefore is more likely a reflection of the Treasury's inattention than any affirmative intention on its part to say anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, the Government warns that "[t]he rule that petitioner advocates would permit significant tax avoidance abuses." Brief for United States 40. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Under petitioner's approach, a corporation that is currently unprofitable but that had substantial income in prior years could (i) acquire a profitable corporation with product liability expense deductions in the year of acquisition, (ii) file a consolidated return and (iii) thereby create an otherwise nonexistent `product liability loss' for the new affiliated group that would allow the acquiring corporation to claim refunds of the tax it paid in prior years." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government suggests, for example, that "a manufacturing company (with prior profits and current losses) that has no product liability exposure could purchase a tobacco company (with both prior and current profits) that has significant product liability expenses" and that "[t]he combined entity could . . . assert a ten-year carryback of `product liability losses' even though the tobacco company has always made a profit and never incurred a `loss' of any type." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 40-41, n. 27.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several answers. First, on the score of tax avoidance, the separate-member approach is no better (and is perhaps worse) than the single-entity treatment; both entail some risk of tax-motivated behavior. See Leatherman, Separate Liability Losses 681 (Under the separate-member approach, "[d]espite sound non-tax business reasons, a group may be disinclined to form a new member or transfer assets between members, because it may worry that it would lose the benefit of a ten-year carryback," and "may be encouraged to transfer assets between members to increase its consolidated &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*838&lt;/span&gt; [PLL], even when those transfers would otherwise be ill-advised"). Second, the Government may, as always, address tax-motivated behavior under Internal Revenue Code &#167; 269, which gives the Secretary ample authority to "disallow [any] deduction, credit, or other allowance" that results from a transaction "the principal purpose [of] which . . . is evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax." 26 U. S. C. &#167; 269(a). And finally, if the Government were to conclude that &#167; 269 provided too little protection and that it simply could not live with the single-entity approach, the Treasury could exercise the authority provided by the Code, 26 U. S. C. &#167; 1502, and amend the consolidated return regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is true, as the Government has argued, that "[t]he Internal Revenue Code vests ample authority in the Treasury to adopt consolidated return regulations to effect a binding resolution of the question presented in this case." Brief for United States 19-20. To the extent that the Government has exercised that authority, its actions point to the single-entity approach as the better answer. To the extent the Government disagrees, it may amend its regulations to provide for a different one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Thomas, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with the Court that the Internal Revenue Code provision and the corresponding Treasury Regulations that control consolidated filings are best interpreted as requiring a single-entity approach in calculating product liability loss. I write separately, however, because I respectfully disagree with the dissent's suggestion that, when a provision of the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*839&lt;/span&gt; Code and the corresponding regulations are ambiguous, this Court should defer to the Government's interpretation. See &lt;i&gt;post&lt;/i&gt; this page (opinion of Stevens, J.). At a bare minimum, in cases such as this one, in which the complex statutory and regulatory scheme lends itself to any number of interpretations, we should be inclined to rely on the traditional canon that construes revenue-raising laws against their drafter.

S. 38, 55 (1904).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a close and difficult case, in which neither the statute nor the regulations offer a definitive answer to the crucial textual question. Absent a clear textual anchor, I would credit the Secretary of the Treasury's concerns about the potential for abuse created by the petitioner's reading of the statutory scheme and affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals on that basis.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*840&lt;/span&gt; As the majority accurately reports, during the time relevant to this case, &#167; 172(b)(1)(I) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 allowed any "taxpayer" who "ha[d] a product liability loss" to carry back its excess product liability losses for 10 years. The resolution of this case turns on whether, when a group of affiliated corporations files a consolidated tax return, the entire group should be considered the "taxpayer" for the purposes of implementing this provision or whether each individual corporation should be seen as a "taxpayer."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no obvious answer to this question. On the one hand, it is generally accepted that the rationale behind the consolidated return regulations is to allow affiliated corporations that are run as a single entity to elect to be treated for tax purposes as a single entity. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Brief for Petitioner 17-19 (collecting sources in which the Internal Revenue Service so stated). On the other hand, it is quite clear that each corporation in such a group remains in both a legal and a literal sense a "taxpayer," a status that has important consequences. See &lt;i&gt;Woolford Realty Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rose,&lt;/i&gt; 286 U. S. 319, 328 (1932) ("The fact is not to be ignored that each of two or more corporations joining . . . in a consolidated return is none the less a taxpayer"); 26 U. S. C. &#167; 7701(a)(14) (defining a "taxpayer" as "any person subject to any internal revenue tax," where a related provision defines "person" to include corporations). As both the group and the individual corporations are considered "taxpayers" in different contexts, the statute presents a genuine ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a provision of the Internal Revenue Code presents a patent ambiguity, Congress, the courts, and the IRS share a preference for resolving the ambiguity via executive action. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc.&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 440 U. S. 472, 477 (1979). This is best &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*841&lt;/span&gt; achieved by the issuing of a Treasury Regulation resolving the ambiguity. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; In this instance, however, the Secretary of the Treasury issued no such regulation. In the absence of such a regulation, the majority has scoured tangentially related regulations, looking for clues to what the Secretary might intend. For want of a more precise basis for resolving this case, that approach is sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is at this point, however, that I part company with the majority's analysis. The fact that the regulations forward a particular method for calculating a consolidated "net operating loss" (NOL) for a group of affiliated companies, see Treas. Reg. &#167; 1.1502-21(f), tells us how the Secretary wants the NOL to be calculated whenever it is necessary to determine a consolidated NOL, but it does not tell us what provisions of the Code require the calculation of a consolidated NOL. That is a separate and prior question. Even if we were to draw some mild significance from the presence of such a regulation (and the absence, at the time these returns were filed, of a similar regulation for the calculation of corporation-specific NOL's), the power of that inference is counterbalanced by the fact that the regulations listing deductions that must be reported at the consolidated level makes no mention of product liability expenses. See Treas. Reg. &#167; 1.1502-12; see also &lt;i&gt;H. Enterprises Int'l, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commisioner,&lt;/i&gt; 105 T. C. 71, 85 (1995) (construing Treas. Reg. &#167; 1.1502-80(a) to provide "[w]here the consolidated return regulations do not require that corporations filing such returns be treated differently from the way separate entities would be treated, those corporations shall be treated as separate entities when applying provisions of the Code"). In addition, the subsequent promulgation of a method for calculating a corporation-specific NOL (albeit for a different purpose), see &#167; 1.1502-79(a)(3) (defining "separate net operating loss"), demonstrates that there are no inherent problems implicit in undertaking such a calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*842&lt;/span&gt; In short, I find no answer to this case in the text of the statute or in any Treasury Regulation.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; However, the Government does forward a valid policy concern that militates against petitioner's construction of the statute: the fear of tax abuse. See Brief for United States 40-42. Put simply, the Government fears that currently unprofitable but previously profitable corporations might receive a substantial windfall simply by acquiring a corporation with significant product liability expenses but no product liability losses. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 40. On a subjective level, I find these concerns troubling. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Woolford Realty Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 286 U. S., at 330 (rejecting "the notion that Congress in permitting a consolidated return was willing to foster an opportunity for juggling so facile and so obvious"). More importantly, however, I credit the Secretary of the Treasury's concerns about the potential scope of abuse. Perhaps the Court is correct in suggesting that these concerns can be alleviated through applications of other anti-abuse provisions of the Tax Code, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt;  at 838, but I am not persuaded of my own ability to make that judgment. When we deal "with a subject that is highly specialized and so complex as to be the despair of judges," &lt;i&gt;Dobson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 320 U. S. 489, 498 (1943), an ounce of deference is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I respectfully dissent.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   &lt;i&gt;Richard E. Zuckerman&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Raymond M. Kethledge&lt;/i&gt; filed a brief for the National Association of Manufacturers et al. as &lt;i&gt;amici curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Unless otherwise noted, all statutory references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U. S. C. &#167; 1 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; (1982 ed. and Supp. V), as in effect between 1983 and 1986, the tax years here in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  If, for example, a company had $100 in taxable income, $50 in deductible PLEs, and $75 in additional deductions, its NOL would be $25 (&lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; $100[H11502]$50[H11502]$75[H11505] [H11502]$25); it could count only $25 of its $50 in PLEs as PLL. If the company had $100 in income, $50 in PLEs, and $125 in additional deductions, its NOL would be $75, and it could count its entire $50 in PLEs as PLL. And, finally, if the company had $100 in income, $50 in PLEs, and $40 in additional deductions, it would have positive income and, thus, no NOL and no PLL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Unless otherwise noted, Treasury Regulation references are to the regulations in effect between 1983 and 1986, 26 CFR &#167; 1.1502-11 &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt;  (1982-1986).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Axelrod &amp;amp; Blank, The Supreme Court, Consolidated Returns, and 10Year Carrybacks, 90 Tax Notes, No. 10, p. 1383 (Mar. 5, 2001) (hereinafter Axelrod &amp;amp; Blank).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  &lt;i&gt;Intermet&lt;/i&gt; involved "specified liability losses" (SLLs), not PLLs. The difference, however, does not matter. The PLL was a statutory predecessor to the SLL, and PLLs were folded into the SLL provision in &#167; 11811(b)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 1388-532. Thus, "[i]n all relevant respects, the provisions on [PLLs] and SLLs are the same." Leatherman, Current Developments for Consolidated Groups, 486 PLI/Tax 389, 393, n. 5 (2000) (hereinafter Leatherman, Current Developments).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  In addition to Treas. Reg. &#167; 1.1502-79(a)(3), discussed &lt;i&gt;infra,&lt;/i&gt; at 832-834, two other provisions, 26 U. S. C. &#167; 1503(f)(2) and the current version (though not the version applicable between 1983 and 1986) of Treas. Reg. &#167; 1502-21(b) (2000), refer to separate group members' NOLs. The parties here have not emphasized those provisions, and with good reason. Not only are they inapplicable to the question before us (either substantively, temporally, or both), but, as one commentator has observed, their references to separate NOLs "ste[m] more from careless drafting than meaningful design." Leatherman, Are Separate Liability Losses Separate for Consolidated Groups?, 52 Tax. Law. 663, 705 (1999) (hereinafter Leatherman, Separate Liability Losses).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  It makes no difference whatsoever whether the affiliate's PLEs are (1) first netted against each member's income and then aggregated or (2) first aggregated and then netted against the group's combined income: under either method, AMCA's CNOL is the same. See Axelrod &amp;amp; Blank 1394 (noting that this conclusion follows from "the associative principle of arithmetic (which holds that the groupings of items in the case of addition and subtraction have no effect on the result)").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Justice Thomas accurately points to a tradition of cases construing "revenue-raising laws" against their drafter. See &lt;i&gt;ante&lt;/i&gt; this page (Thomas, J.,concurring). However, when the ambiguous provision in question is not one that imposes tax liability but rather one that crafts an exception from a general revenue duty for the benefit of some taxpayers, a countervailing tradition suggests that the ambiguity should be resolved in the government's favor. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;INDOPCO, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt; 503 U. S. 79, 84 (1992); &lt;i&gt;Interstate Transit Lines&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Commissioner,&lt;/i&gt;  319 U. S. 590, 593 (1943); &lt;i&gt;Deputy, Administratrix&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Du Pont,&lt;/i&gt; 308 U. S. 488, 493 (1940); &lt;i&gt;New Colonial Ice Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Helvering,&lt;/i&gt; 292 U. S. 435, 440 (1934); &lt;i&gt;Woolford Realty Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rose,&lt;/i&gt; 286 U. S. 319, 326 (1932).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  I am also in full agreement with the Court's rejection of the Government's double-deduction argument. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 834-835.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Because I agree with the majority that the calculation contemplated by Treas. Reg. &#167; 1.1502-79(a)(3) better approximates the NOL that each company would have had reported if filing individually than the alternative forwarded by the Government, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 833, I agree with the Court of Appeals' decision to adopt that measure and would affirm the decision below in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*786&lt;/span&gt; Justice O'Connor, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1989, we held that Johnny Paul Penry had been sentenced to death in violation of the Eighth Amendment because his jury had not been adequately instructed with respect to mitigating evidence. See &lt;i&gt;Penry&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lynaugh,&lt;/i&gt; 492 U. S. 302 (1989) &lt;i&gt;(Penry I)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; The State of Texas retried Penry in 1990, and that jury also found him guilty of capital murder and sentenced him to death. We now consider whether the jury instructions at Penry's resentencing complied with our mandate in &lt;i&gt;Penry I.&lt;/i&gt; We also consider whether the admission into evidence of statements from a psychiatric report based on an uncounseled interview with Penry ran afoul of the Fifth Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnny Paul Penry brutally raped and murdered Pamela Carpenter on October 25, 1979. In 1980, a Texas jury found him guilty of capital murder. At the close of the penalty hearing, the jury was instructed to answer three statutorily mandated "special issues":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"`(1) whether the conduct of the defendant that caused the death of the deceased was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased or another would result; "`(2) whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society; and "`(3) if raised by the evidence, whether the conduct of the defendant in killing the deceased was unreasonable in response to the provocation, if any, by the deceased.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 310 (quoting Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071(b) (Vernon 1981 and Supp. 1989)).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury answered "yes" to each issue and, as required by statute, the trial court sentenced Penry to death. 492 U. S., at 310-311.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*787&lt;/span&gt; Although Penry had offered extensive evidence that he was mentally retarded and had been severely abused as a child, the jury was never instructed that it could consider and give mitigating effect to that evidence in imposing sentence. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 320. Nor was any of the three special issues broad enough in scope that the jury could consider and give effect to the mitigating evidence in answering the special issue. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 322-325. While Penry's mental retardation was potentially relevant to the first special issue&#151;whether he had acted deliberately&#151;we found no way to be sure that the jurors fully considered the mitigating evidence as it bore on the broader question of Penry's moral culpability. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 322-323. As to the second issue&#151;whether Penry would be a future danger&#151;the evidence of his mental retardation and history of abuse was "relevant only as an &lt;i&gt;aggravating&lt;/i&gt; factor." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 323 (emphasis in original). And the evidence was simply not relevant in a mitigating way to the third issue&#151;whether Penry had unreasonably responded to any provocation. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 324-325.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments of counsel also failed to clarify the jury's role. Defense counsel had urged the jurors to vote "no" on one of the special issues if they believed that Penry, because of the mitigating evidence, did not deserve to be put to death. The prosecutor, however, had reminded them of their "oath to follow the law and . . . answe[r] these questions based on the evidence and following the law." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 325 (internal quotation marks omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In light of the prosecutor's argument, and . . . in the absence of instructions informing the jury that it could consider and give effect to the mitigating evidence of Penry's mental retardation and abused background by declining to impose the death penalty," we concluded that "a reasonable juror could well have believed that there was no vehicle for expressing the view that Penry did not deserve to be sentenced to death based upon his mitigating evidence." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 326, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*788&lt;/span&gt; 328. We thus vacated Penry's sentence, confirming that in a capital case, "[t]he sentencer must . . . be able to consider and give effect to [mitigating] evidence in imposing sentence," so that "`the sentence imposed . . . reflec[ts] a reasoned &lt;i&gt;moral&lt;/i&gt; response to the defendant's background, character, and crime.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 319 (quoting &lt;i&gt;California&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Brown,&lt;/i&gt;  479 U. S. 538, 545 (1987) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (emphasis in original)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penry was retried in 1990 and again found guilty of capital murder. During the penalty phase, the defense again put on extensive evidence regarding Penry's mental impairments and childhood abuse. One defense witness on the subject of Penry's mental impairments was Dr. Randall Price, a clinical neuropsychologist. On direct examination, Dr. Price testified that he believed Penry suffered from organic brain impairment and mental retardation. App. 276-279; 878. In the course of cross-examining Dr. Price, the prosecutor asked what records Price had reviewed in preparing his testimony. Price cited 14 reports, including a psychiatric evaluation of Penry prepared by Dr. Felix Peebles on May 19, 1977. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 327. The Peebles report had been prepared at the request of Penry's then-counsel to determine Penry's competency to stand trial on a 1977 rape charge&#151;unrelated to the rape and murder of Pamela Carpenter. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 55-60, 125. The prosecutor asked Dr. Price to read a specific portion of the Peebles report for the jury. Over the objection of defense counsel, Dr. Price recited that it was Dr. Peebles' "professional opinion that if Johnny Paul Penry were released from custody, that he would be dangerous to other persons." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 413. The prosecutor again recited this portion of the Peebles report during his closing argument. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 668.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came time to submit the case to the jury, the court instructed the jury to determine Penry's sentence by answering three special issues&#151;the same three issues that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*789&lt;/span&gt; had been put before the jury in &lt;i&gt;Penry I.&lt;/i&gt; Specifically, the jury had to determine whether Penry acted deliberately when he killed Pamela Carpenter; whether there was a probability that Penry would be dangerous in the future; and whether Penry acted unreasonably in response to provocation. App. 676-678. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Penry I,&lt;/i&gt; 492 U. S., at 320.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court told the jury how to determine its answers to those issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[B]efore any issue may be answered `Yes,' all jurors must be convinced by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the answer to such issue should be `Yes.' . . . [I]f any juror, after considering the evidence and these instructions, has a reasonable doubt as to whether the answer to a Special Issue should be answered `Yes,' then such juror should vote `No' to that Special Issue." App. 672-673.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court explained the consequences of the jury's decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[I]f you return an affirmative finding on each of the special issues submitted to you, the court shall sentence the defendant to death. You are further instructed that if you return a negative finding on any special issue submitted to you, the court shall sentence the defendant to the Texas Department of Corrections for life. You are therefore instructed that your answers to the special issues, which determine the punishment to be assessed the defendant by the court, should be reflective of your finding as to the personal culpability of the defendant, JOHNNY PAUL PENRY, in this case." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 674-675.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court then gave the following "supplemental instruction":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"You are instructed that when you deliberate on the questions posed in the special issues, you are to consider &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*790&lt;/span&gt; mitigating circumstances, if any, supported by the evidence presented in both phases of the trial, whether presented by the state or the defendant. A mitigating circumstance may include, but is not limited to, any aspect of the defendant's character and record or circumstances of the crime which you believe could make a death sentence inappropriate in this case. If you find that there are any mitigating circumstances in this case, you must decide how much weight they deserve, if any, and therefore, give effect and consideration to them in assessing the defendant's personal culpability at the time you answer the special issue. If you determine, when giving effect to the mitigating evidence, if any, that a life sentence, as reflected by a negative finding to the issue under consideration, rather than a death sentence, is an appropriate response to the personal culpability of the defendant, a negative finding should be given to one of the special issues." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 675.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A complete copy of the instructions was attached to the verdict form, and the jury took the entire packet into the deliberation room. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31. The verdict form itself, however, contained only the text of the three special issues, and gave the jury two choices with respect to each special issue: "We, the jury, unanimously find and determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the answer to this Special Issue is `Yes,' " or "We, the jury, because at least ten (10) jurors have a reasonable doubt as to the matter inquired about in this Special Issue, find and determine that the answer to this Special Issue is `No.' " App. 676-678.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deliberating for approximately 2&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;20442 hours, the jury returned its punishment verdict. See 51 Record 1948, 1950. The signed verdict form confirmed that the jury had unanimously agreed that the answer to each special issue was "yes." App. 676-678. In accordance with state law, the court sentenced Penry to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*791&lt;/span&gt; The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Penry's conviction and sentence. The court rejected Penry's claim that the admission of language from the 1977 Peebles report violated Penry's Fifth Amendment privilege against selfincrimination. The court reasoned that because Dr. Peebles had examined Penry two years prior to the murder of Pamela Carpenter, Penry had not at that time been "confronted with someone who was essentially an agent for the State whose function was to gather evidence that might be used against him in connection with the crime for which he was incarcerated." &lt;i&gt;Penry&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; 903 S. W. 2d 715, 759-760 (1995) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court also rejected Penry's claim that the jury instructions given at his second sentencing hearing were constitutionally inadequate because they did not permit the jury to consider and give effect to his mitigating evidence of mental retardation and childhood abuse. The court cited &lt;i&gt;Penry I&lt;/i&gt;  for the proposition that when a defendant proffers "mitigating evidence that is not relevant to the special issues or that has relevance to the defendant's moral culpability beyond the scope of the special issues . . . the jury must be given a special instruction in order to allow it to consider and give effect to such evidence." 903 S. W. 2d, at 765. Quoting the supplemental jury instruction given at Penry's second trial, see &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 789-790, the court overruled Penry's claim of error. The court stated that "a nullification instruction such as this one is sufficient to meet the constitutional requirements of &lt;i&gt;[Penry I].&lt;/i&gt; " 903 S. W. 2d, at 765.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998, after his petition for state habeas corpus relief was denied, see App. 841 (trial court order); &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 863 (Court of Criminal Appeals order), Penry filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2254 (1994 ed. and Supp. V) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The District Court rejected both of Penry's claims, finding that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals' conclusions on both points were neither contrary &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*792&lt;/span&gt; to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. App. 893, 920. After full briefing and argument, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied a certificate of appealability. 215 F. 3d 504 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed Penry's execution and granted certiorari to consider Penry's constitutional arguments regarding the admission of the Peebles report and the adequacy of the jury instructions. 531 U. S. 1010 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Penry filed his federal habeas petition after the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, the provisions of that law govern the scope of our review. Specifically, 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2254(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. V) prohibits a federal court from granting an application for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless that adjudication "resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Term in &lt;i&gt;Williams&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Taylor,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S. 362 (2000), we explained that the "contrary to" and "unreasonable application" clauses of &#167; 2254(d)(1) have independent meaning. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 404. A state court decision will be "contrary to" our clearly established precedent if the state court either "applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in our cases," or "confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of this Court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from our precedent." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 405-406. A state court decision will be an "unreasonable application of" our clearly established precedent if it "correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner's case." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 407-408.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*793&lt;/span&gt; "[A] federal habeas court making the `unreasonable application' inquiry should ask whether the state court's application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 409. Distinguishing between an unreasonable and an incorrect application of federal law, we clarified that even if the federal habeas court concludes that the state court decision applied clearly established federal law incorrectly, relief is appropriate only if that application is also objectively unreasonable. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 410-411.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the District Court evaluated the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals' disposition of Penry's claims under a standard we later rejected in &lt;i&gt;Williams,&lt;/i&gt; see App. 882 (stating that an application of law to facts is "unreasonable `only when it can be said that reasonable jurists considering the question would be of one view that the state court ruling was incorrect' " (citation omitted)), the Fifth Circuit articulated the proper standard of review, as set forth in &#167; 2254(d)(1) and clarified in &lt;i&gt;Williams,&lt;/i&gt; and denied Penry relief. Guided by this same standard, we now turn to the substance of Penry's claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penry contends that the admission into evidence of the portion of the 1977 Peebles report that referred to Penry's future dangerousness violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination because he was never warned that the statements he made to Dr. Peebles might later be used against him. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals disagreed, concluding that when Dr. Peebles interviewed Penry, Peebles was not acting as an agent for the State in order to gather evidence that might be used against Penry. 903 S. W. 2d, at 759.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penry argues that this case is indistinguishable from &lt;i&gt;Estelle&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Smith,&lt;/i&gt; 451 U. S. 454 (1981). In &lt;i&gt;Estelle,&lt;/i&gt; we considered a situation in which a psychiatrist conducted an &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*794&lt;/span&gt; ostensibly neutral competency examination of a capital defendant, but drew conclusions from the defendant's uncounseled statements regarding his future dangerousness, and later testified for the prosecution on that crucial issue. We likened the psychiatrist to "an agent of the State recounting unwarned statements made in a postarrest custodial setting," and held that "[a] criminal defendant, who neither initiates a psychiatric evaluation nor attempts to introduce any psychiatric evidence, may not be compelled to respond to a psychiatrist if his statements can be used against him at a capital sentencing proceeding." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 467&#151; 468. The admission of the psychiatrist's testimony under those "distinct circumstances" violated the Fifth Amendment. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 466.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case differs from &lt;i&gt;Estelle&lt;/i&gt; in several respects. First, the defendant in &lt;i&gt;Estelle&lt;/i&gt; had not placed his mental condition at issue, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 457, n. 1, whereas Penry himself made his mental status a central issue in both the 1977 rape case and his trials for Pamela Carpenter's rape and murder. Second, in &lt;i&gt;Estelle,&lt;/i&gt; the trial court had called for the competency evaluation and the State had chosen the examining psychiatrist. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 456-457. Here, however, it was Penry's own counsel in the 1977 case who requested the psychiatric exam performed by Dr. Peebles. Third, in &lt;i&gt;Estelle,&lt;/i&gt; the State had called the psychiatrist to testify as a part of its affirmative case. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 459. Here, it was during the crossexamination of Penry's own psychological witness that the prosecutor elicited the quotation from the Peebles report. And fourth, in &lt;i&gt;Estelle,&lt;/i&gt; the defendant was charged with a capital crime at the time of his competency exam, and it was thus clear that his future dangerousness would be a specific issue at sentencing. Penry, however, had not yet murdered Pamela Carpenter at the time of his interview with Dr. Peebles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need not and do not decide whether these differences affect the merits of Penry's Fifth Amendment claim. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*795&lt;/span&gt; Rather, the question is whether the Texas court's decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of our precedent. 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2254(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. V). We think it was not. The differences between this case and &lt;i&gt;Estelle&lt;/i&gt;  are substantial, and our opinion in &lt;i&gt;Estelle&lt;/i&gt; suggested that our holding was limited to the "distinct circumstances" presented there. It also indicated that the Fifth Amendment analysis might be different where a defendant "intends to introduce psychiatric evidence at the penalty phase." 451 U. S., at 472. Indeed, we have never extended &lt;i&gt;Estelle&lt;/i&gt; `s Fifth Amendment holding beyond its particular facts. Cf., &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Buchanan&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kentucky,&lt;/i&gt; 483 U. S. 402 (1987) (&lt;i&gt;Estelle&lt;/i&gt;  does not apply, and it does not violate the Fifth Amendment, where a prosecutor uses portions of a psychiatric evaluation requested by a defendant to rebut psychiatric evidence presented by the defendant at trial). We therefore cannot say that it was objectively unreasonable for the Texas court to conclude that Penry is not entitled to relief on his Fifth Amendment claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if our precedent were to establish squarely that the prosecution's use of the Peebles report violated Penry's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, that error would justify overturning Penry's sentence only if Penry could establish that the error "`had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' " &lt;i&gt;Brecht&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Abrahamson,&lt;/i&gt; 507 U. S. 619, 637 (1993) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Kotteakos&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 328 U. S. 750, 776 (1946)). We think it unlikely that Penry could make such a showing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excerpt from the Peebles report bolstered the State's argument that Penry posed a future danger, but it was neither the first nor the last opinion the jury heard on that point. Four prison officials testified that they were of the opinion that Penry "would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society." App. 94, 104, 138; 47 Record 970. Three psychiatrists testified &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*796&lt;/span&gt; that Penry was a dangerous individual and likely to remain so. Two were the State's own witnesses. See App. 487, 557. The third was Dr. Price&#151;the same defense witness whom the prosecutor had asked to read from the Peebles report. Before that recitation, Dr. Price had stated his own opinion that "[i]f [Penry] was in the free world, I would consider him dangerous." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 392.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Peebles report was an effective rhetorical tool, it was by no means the key to the State's case on the question whether Penry was likely to commit future acts of violence. We therefore have considerable doubt that the admission of the Peebles report, even if erroneous, had a "substantial and injurious effect" on the verdict. &lt;i&gt;Brecht&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Abrahamson, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 637. Accordingly, we will not disturb the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals' rejection of Penry's Fifth Amendment claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penry also contends that the jury instructions given at his second sentencing hearing did not comport with our holding in &lt;i&gt;Penry I&lt;/i&gt; because they did not provide the jury with a vehicle for expressing its reasoned moral response to the mitigating evidence of Penry's mental retardation and childhood abuse. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals disagreed. The court summarized &lt;i&gt;Penry I&lt;/i&gt; as holding that when a defendant proffers "mitigating evidence that is not relevant to the special issues or that has relevance to the defendant's moral culpability beyond the scope of the special issues . . . the jury must be given a special instruction in order to allow it to consider and give effect to such evidence." 903 S. W. 2d, at 765. The court then stated that the supplemental jury instruction given at Penry's second sentencing hearing satisfied that mandate. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas court did not make the rationale of its holding entirely clear. On one hand, it might have believed that &lt;i&gt;Penry I&lt;/i&gt; was satisfied merely by virtue of the fact that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*797&lt;/span&gt; a supplemental instruction had been given. On the other hand, it might have believed that it was the substance of that instruction which satisfied &lt;i&gt;Penry I.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the latter seems to be more likely, to the extent it was the former, the Texas court clearly misapprehended our prior decision. &lt;i&gt;Penry I&lt;/i&gt; did not hold that the mere mention of "mitigating circumstances" to a capital sentencing jury satisfies the Eighth Amendment. Nor does it stand for the proposition that it is constitutionally sufficient to inform the jury that it may "consider" mitigating circumstances in deciding the appropriate sentence. Rather, the key under &lt;i&gt;Penry I&lt;/i&gt; is that the jury be able to "consider and &lt;i&gt;give effect to&lt;/i&gt; [a defendant's mitigating] evidence in imposing sentence." 492 U. S., at 319 (emphasis added). See also &lt;i&gt;Johnson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Texas,&lt;/i&gt; 509 U. S. 350, 381 (1993) (O'Connor, J., dissenting) ("[A] sentencer [must] be allowed to give &lt;i&gt;full&lt;/i&gt; consideration and &lt;i&gt;full&lt;/i&gt; effect to mitigating circumstances" (emphasis in original)). For it is only when the jury is given a "vehicle for expressing its `reasoned moral response' to that evidence in rendering its sentencing decision," &lt;i&gt;Penry I,&lt;/i&gt; 492 U. S., at 328, that we can be sure that the jury "has treated the defendant as a `uniquely individual human bein[g]' and has made a reliable determination that death is the appropriate sentence," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 319 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Woodson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;North Carolina,&lt;/i&gt;  428 U. S. 280, 304, 305 (1976)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State contends that the substance of the supplemental instruction satisfied &lt;i&gt;Penry I&lt;/i&gt; because it provided the jury with the requisite vehicle for expressing its reasoned moral response to Penry's particular mitigating evidence. Specifically, the State points to the admittedly "less than artful" portion of the supplemental instruction which says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If you find that there are any mitigating circumstances in this case, you must decide how much weight they deserve, if any, and therefore, give effect and consideration to them in assessing the defendant's personal culpability &lt;i&gt;at the time you answer the special issue.&lt;/i&gt; If you determine, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*798&lt;/span&gt; when giving effect to the mitigating evidence, if any, that a life sentence, &lt;i&gt;as reflected by a negative&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;finding to the issue under consideration,&lt;/i&gt; rather than a death sentence, is an appropriate response to the personal culpability of the defendant, &lt;i&gt;a negative finding&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;should be given to one of the special issues.&lt;/i&gt; " App. 675 (emphasis added). See also Brief for Respondent 16.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see two possible ways to interpret this confusing instruction. First, as the portions italicized above indicate, it can be understood as telling the jurors to take Penry's mitigating evidence into account in determining their truthful answers to each special issue. Viewed in this light, however, the supplemental instruction placed the jury in no better position than was the jury in &lt;i&gt;Penry I.&lt;/i&gt; As we made clear in &lt;i&gt;Penry I,&lt;/i&gt; none of the special issues is broad enough to provide a vehicle for the jury to give mitigating effect to the evidence of Penry's mental retardation and childhood abuse. Cf. 492 U. S., at 322-325. In the words of Judge Dennis below, the jury's ability to consider and give effect to Penry's mitigating evidence was still "shackled and confined within the scope of the three special issues." 215 F. 3d, at 514 (dissenting opinion). Thus, because the supplemental instruction had no practical effect, the jury instructions at Penry's second sentencing were not meaningfully different from the ones we found constitutionally inadequate in &lt;i&gt;Penry I.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the State urges, it is possible to understand the supplemental instruction as informing the jury that it could "simply answer one of the special issues `no' if it believed that mitigating circumstances made a life sentence . . . appropriate . . . regardless of its initial answers to the questions." Brief for Respondent 16. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals appeared to understand the instruction in this sense, when it termed the supplemental instruction a "nullification instruction." 903 S. W. 2d, at 765. Even assuming the jurors could have understood the instruction &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*799&lt;/span&gt; to operate in this way, the instruction was not as simple to implement as the State contends. Rather, it made the jury charge as a whole internally contradictory, and placed law-abiding jurors in an impossible situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury was clearly instructed that a "yes" answer to a special issue was appropriate only when supported "by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt." App. 672. A "no" answer was appropriate only when there was "a reasonable doubt as to whether the answer to a Special Issue should be . . .'Yes.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 673. The verdict form listed the three special issues and, with no mention of mitigating circumstances, confirmed and clarified the jury's two choices with respect to each special issue. The jury could swear that it had unanimously determined "beyond a reasonable doubt that the answer to this Special Issue is `Yes.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 676-678. Or it could swear that at least 10 jurors had "a reasonable doubt &lt;i&gt;as to the matter inquired about in this Special Issue&lt;/i&gt; " and that the jury thus had "determin[ed] that the answer to this Special Issue is `No.' " &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the State's view, however, the jury was also told that it could ignore these clear guidelines and&#151;even if there was in fact no reasonable doubt as to the matter inquired about&#151; answer any special issue in the negative if the mitigating circumstances warranted a life sentence. In other words, the jury could change one or more truthful "yes" answers to an untruthful "no" answer in order to avoid a death sentence for Penry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We generally presume that jurors follow their instructions. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Richardson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Marsh,&lt;/i&gt; 481 U. S. 200, 211 (1987). Here, however, it would have been both logically and ethically impossible for a juror to follow both sets of instructions. Because Penry's mitigating evidence did not fit within the scope of the special issues, answering those issues in the manner prescribed on the verdict form necessarily meant ignoring the command of the supplemental instruction. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*800&lt;/span&gt; And answering the special issues in the mode prescribed by the supplemental instruction necessarily meant ignoring the verdict form instructions. Indeed, jurors who wanted to answer one of the special issues falsely to give effect to the mitigating evidence would have had to violate their oath to render a "`true verdict.' " Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 35.22 (Vernon 1989).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism created by the supplemental instruction thus inserted "an element of capriciousness" into the sentencing decision, "making the jurors' power to avoid the death penalty dependent on their willingness" to elevate the supplemental instruction over the verdict form instructions. &lt;i&gt;Roberts&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Louisiana,&lt;/i&gt; 428 U. S. 325, 335 (1976) (plurality opinion). There is, at the very least, "a reasonable likelihood that the jury . . . applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevent[ed] the consideration" of Penry's mental retardation and childhood abuse. &lt;i&gt;Boyde&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;California,&lt;/i&gt; 494 U. S. 370, 380 (1990). The supplemental instruction therefore provided an inadequate vehicle for the jury to make a reasoned moral response to Penry's mitigating evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals focused solely on the supplemental instruction in affirming Penry's sentence, the State urges us to evaluate the instruction contextually, with reference to the comments of the prosecutor and defense counsel, as well as the comments of the court during &lt;i&gt;voir dire.&lt;/i&gt; Indeed, we have said that we will approach jury instructions in the same way a jury would&#151;with a "commonsense understanding of the instructions in the light of all that has taken place at the trial." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 381. &lt;i&gt;Penry I&lt;/i&gt; itself illustrates this methodology, as there we evaluated the likely effect on the jury of the comments of the defense counsel and prosecutor. 492 U. S., at 325-326. As we did there, however, we conclude that these comments were insufficient to clarify the confusion caused by the instructions themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*801&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Voir dire&lt;/i&gt; was a month-long process, during which approximately 90 prospective jurors were interviewed. See 3 Record (index of transcripts). Many of the venire members&#151; including each of the 12 jurors who was eventually empaneled&#151;received a copy of an instruction largely similar to the supplemental instruction ultimately given to the jury. After each juror read the instruction, the judge attempted to explain how it worked. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; 18 Record 966&#151; 967 ("[I]f you thought the mitigating evidence was sufficient . . . you might, even though you really felt those answers [to the three special issues] should be yes, you might answer one or more of them no . . . so [Penry] could get the life sentence rather than the death penalty"). The prosecutor then attempted to explain the instruction. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 980 ("[E]ven though [you] believe all three of these answers are yes, [you] don't think the death penalty is appropriate for this particular person because of what has happened to him in the past . . . . [The] instruction is to give effect to that belief and answer one or all of these issues no"). And with most of the jurors, defense counsel also gave a similar explanation. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1018 ("[I]f you believe[d] [there] was a mitigating circumstance . . . you [could] apply that mitigation to answer&#151;going back and changing an answer from yes to a no").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these comments reinforce the State's construction of the supplemental instruction, they do not bolster our confidence in the jurors' ability to give effect to Penry's mitigating evidence in deciding his sentence. Rather, they highlight the arbitrary way in which the supplemental instruction operated, and the fact that the jury was essentially instructed to return a false answer to a special issue in order to avoid a death sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we are skeptical that, by the time their penalty phase deliberations began, the jurors would have remembered the explanations given during &lt;i&gt;voir dire,&lt;/i&gt; much less taken them as a binding statement of the law. &lt;i&gt;Voir dire&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*802&lt;/span&gt; began almost two full months before the penalty phase deliberations. In the interim, the jurors had observed the rest of &lt;i&gt;voir dire,&lt;/i&gt; listened to a 5-day guilt-phase trial and extensive instructions, participated in 2&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;20442 hours of deliberations with respect to Penry's guilt, and listened to another 5-day trial on punishment. The comments of the court and counsel during &lt;i&gt;voir dire&lt;/i&gt; were surely a distant and convoluted memory by the time the jurors began their deliberations on Penry's sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State also contends that the closing arguments in the penalty phase clarified matters. Penry's counsel attempted to describe the jury's task:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If, when you thought about mental retardation and the child abuse, you think that this guy deserves a life sentence, and not a death sentence, . . . then, you get to answer one of . . . those questions no. The Judge has not told you which question, and you have to give that answer, even if you decide the literally correct answer is yes. Not the easiest instruction to follow and the law does funny things sometimes." App. 640.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, however, this explanation only reminded the jurors that they had to answer the special issues &lt;i&gt;dis&lt;/i&gt; honestly in order to give effect to Penry's mitigating evidence. For the reasons discussed above, such a "clarification" provided no real help. Moreover, even if we thought that the arguments of defense counsel could be an adequate substitute for statements of the law by the court, but see &lt;i&gt;Boyde&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;California, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 384, the prosecutor effectively neutralized defense counsel's argument, as did the prosecutor in &lt;i&gt;Penry I,&lt;/i&gt; by stressing the jury's duty "[t]o follow your oath, the evidence and the law." App. 616. At best, the jury received mixed signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our opinion in &lt;i&gt;Penry I&lt;/i&gt; provided sufficient guidance as to how the trial court might have drafted the jury charge for Penry's second sentencing hearing to comply with our &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*803&lt;/span&gt; mandate. We specifically indicated that our concerns would have been alleviated by a jury instruction defining the term "deliberately" in the first special issue "in a way that would clearly direct the jury to consider fully Penry's mitigating evidence as it bears on his personal culpability." 492 U. S., at 323. The trial court surely could have drafted an instruction to this effect. Indeed, Penry offered two definitions of "deliberately" that the trial court refused to give. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12, 14-15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clearly drafted catchall instruction on mitigating evidence also might have complied with &lt;i&gt;Penry I.&lt;/i&gt; Texas' current capital sentencing scheme (revised after Penry's second trial and sentencing) provides a helpful frame of reference. Texas now requires the jury to decide "[w]hether, taking into consideration all of the evidence, including the circumstances of the offense, the defendant's character and background, and the personal moral culpability of the defendant, there is a sufficient mitigating circumstance or circumstances to warrant that a sentence of life imprisonment rather than a death sentence be imposed." Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071(2)(e)(1) (Vernon Supp. 2001).&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; Penry's counsel, while not conceding the issue, admitted that he "would have a tough time saying that &lt;i&gt;[Penry I]&lt;/i&gt; was not complied with under the new Texas procedure." Tr. of Oral Arg. 16. At the very least, the brevity and clarity of this instruction highlight the confusing nature of the supplemental instruction actually given, and indicate that the trial court had adequate alternatives available to it as it drafted the instructions for Penry's trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, to the extent the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals concluded that the substance of the jury instructions given &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*804&lt;/span&gt; at Penry's second sentencing hearing satisfied our mandate in &lt;i&gt;Penry I,&lt;/i&gt; that determination was objectively unreasonable. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Shafer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;South Carolina, ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 40, 50 (holding on direct review that the South Carolina Supreme Court "incorrectly limited" our holding in &lt;i&gt;Simmons&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;South Carolina,&lt;/i&gt;  512 U. S. 154 (1994), because the court had mischaracterized "how the State's new [capital sentencing] scheme works"). The three special issues submitted to the jury were identical to the ones we found constitutionally inadequate as applied in &lt;i&gt;Penry I.&lt;/i&gt; Although the supplemental instruction made mention of mitigating evidence, the mechanism it purported to create for the jurors to give effect to that evidence was ineffective and illogical. The comments of the court and counsel accomplished little by way of clarification. Any realistic assessment of the manner in which the supplemental instruction operated would therefore lead to the same conclusion we reached in &lt;i&gt;Penry I:&lt;/i&gt; "[A] reasonable juror could well have believed that there was no vehicle for expressing the view that Penry did not deserve to be sentenced to death based upon his mitigating evidence." 492 U. S., at 326.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is therefore affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia join, concurring in Parts I, II, and III&#151;A, and dissenting in Part III&#151;B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Texas juries have now deliberated and reasoned that Penry's brutal rape and murder of Pamela Carpenter warrants the death penalty under Texas law. And two opinions of this Court have now overruled those decisions on the ground that the sentencing courts should have said more about Penry's alleged mitigating evidence. Because I believe the most recent sentencing court gave the jurors &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*805&lt;/span&gt; an opportunity to consider the evidence Penry presented, I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a habeas reviewing court, we are not called upon to propose what we believe to be the ideal instruction on how a jury should take into account evidence related to Penry's childhood and mental status. Our job is much simpler, and it is significantly removed from writing the instruction in the first instance. We must decide merely whether the conclusion of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals&#151;that the sentencing court's supplemental instruction explaining how the jury could give effect to any mitigating value it found in Penry's evidence satisfied the requirements of &lt;i&gt;Penry&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lynaugh,&lt;/i&gt; 492 U. S. 302 (1989) &lt;i&gt;(Penry I)&lt;/i&gt; &#151;was "objectively unreasonable." &lt;i&gt;Williams&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Taylor,&lt;/i&gt; 529 U. S. 362, 409 (2000). See also 28 U. S. C. &#167; 2254(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. V).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Penry's first sentencing, the court read to the jury Texas' three special issues for capital sentencing.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The court did not instruct the jury that "it could consider the evidence offered by Penry as &lt;i&gt;mitigating&lt;/i&gt; evidence and that it could give mitigating effect to that evidence in imposing sentence." 492 U. S., at 320. The prosecutor also did not offer any way for the jury to give mitigating effect to the evidence, but instead simply reiterated that the jury was to answer the three questions and follow the law. In &lt;i&gt;Penry I,&lt;/i&gt;  this Court concluded that, "[i]n light of the prosecutor's argument, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*806&lt;/span&gt; and in the absence of appropriate jury instructions, a reasonable juror could well have believed that there was no vehicle for expressing the view that Penry did not deserve to be sentenced to death based upon his mitigating evidence." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 326.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Penry's second sentencing, the court read to the jury the same three special issues. In contrast to the first sentencing, however, the court instructed the jury at length that it could consider Penry's proffered evidence as mitigating evidence and that it could give mitigating effect to that evidence. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 789-790. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals concluded that this supplemental instruction "allow[ed] [the jury] to consider and give effect to" Penry's proffered mitigating evidence and therefore was "sufficient to meet the constitutional requirements of &lt;i&gt;[Penry I]&lt;/i&gt; ."&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Penry&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; 903 S. W. 2d 715, 765 (1995). In my view, this decision is not only objectively reasonable but also compelled by this Court's precedents and by common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In evaluating the instructions, [a court should] not engage in a technical parsing of this language of the instructions, but instead approach the instructions in the same way that the jury would&#151;with a `commonsense understanding of the instructions in the light of all that has taken place at the trial.' " &lt;i&gt;Johnson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Texas,&lt;/i&gt; 509 U. S. 350, 368 (1993) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Boyde&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;California,&lt;/i&gt; 494 U. S. 370, 381 (1990)). The Texas court's instruction, read for common sense, or, even after a technical parsing, tells jurors that they may consider the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*807&lt;/span&gt; evidence Penry presented as mitigating evidence and that, if they believe the mitigating evidence makes a death sentence inappropriate, they should answer "no" to one of the special issues. Given this straightforward reading of the instructions, it is objectively reasonable, if not eminently logical, to conclude that a reasonable juror would have believed he had a "vehicle for expressing the view that Penry did not deserve to be sentenced to death based upon his mitigating evidence." 492 U. S., at 326.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that Penry's proffered evidence did not fit neatly into any of the three special issues for imposing the death penalty under Texas law.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; But the sentencing court told the jury in no uncertain terms precisely how to follow this Court's directive in &lt;i&gt;Penry I.&lt;/i&gt; First, the sentencing court instructed the jury that it could consider such evidence to be mitigating evidence. See App. 675 ("[W]hen you deliberate on the questions posed in the special issues, you are to consider mitigating circumstances, if any, supported by the evidence presented in both phases of the trial, whether presented by the state or the defendant. A mitigating circumstance may include, but is not limited to, any aspect of the defendant's character and record or circumstances of the crime which you believe could make a death sentence inappropriate in this case"). Next, the court explained to the jury how it must give effect to the evidence. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt;  ("If you find that there are any mitigating circumstances in this case, you must decide how much weight they deserve, if any, and therefore, give effect and consideration to them in assessing the defendant's personal culpability at the time you answer the special issue"). And finally, the court unambiguously instructed: "If you determine, when giving &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*808&lt;/span&gt; effect to the mitigating evidence, if any, that a life sentence, as reflected by a negative finding to the issue under consideration, rather than a death sentence, is an appropriate response to the personal culpability of the defendant, &lt;i&gt;a negative finding should be given to one of the special issues." Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; (emphasis added). Without performing legal acrobatics, I cannot make the instruction confusing. And I certainly cannot do the contortions necessary to find the Texas appellate court's decision "objectively unreasonable."&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; I simply do not share the Court's confusion as to how a juror could consider mitigating evidence, decide whether it makes a death sentence inappropriate, and respond with a "yes" or "no" depending on the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*809&lt;/span&gt; Curiously, this Court concludes that the supplemental instruction "inserted `an element of capriciousness' into the sentencing decision, `making the jurors' power to avoid the death penalty dependent on their willingness' to elevate the supplemental instruction over the verdict form instructions." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 800 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Roberts&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Louisiana,&lt;/i&gt;  428 U. S. 325, 335 (1976) (plurality opinion)). Any reference to &lt;i&gt;Roberts,&lt;/i&gt; however, is wholly misplaced. &lt;i&gt;Roberts&lt;/i&gt; involved a situation in which the jury was told to find the defendant guilty of a lesser included offense, unsupported by any evidence, if the jury did not want him to be sentenced to death. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 334-335. In Penry's case there was no suggestion, express or implied, made to the jury that it could &lt;i&gt;disregard&lt;/i&gt;  the evidence. On the contrary, it was instructed on how to &lt;i&gt;give effect to&lt;/i&gt; Penry's proffered evidence, as required by this Court in &lt;i&gt;Penry I.&lt;/i&gt; Tellingly, the &lt;i&gt;Roberts&lt;/i&gt; plurality stated in full that "[t]here is an element of capriciousness in making the jurors' power to avoid the death penalty dependent on their willingness to accept this invitation to &lt;i&gt;disregard the trial judge's instructions.&lt;/i&gt; " 428 U. S., at 335 (emphasis added). In Penry's case, the judge's instructions included an explanation of how to answer the three special issues and how to give effect to the mitigating evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, contrary to the Court's claim that the jury received "mixed signals," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 802, it appears that it is the Texas courts that have received the mixed signals. In &lt;i&gt;Jurek&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Texas,&lt;/i&gt; 428 U. S. 262 (1976), this Court upheld the Texas sentencing statute at issue here against attack under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The joint opinion in &lt;i&gt;Jurek&lt;/i&gt; concluded that the statute permits the jury "to consider whatever evidence of mitigating circumstances the defense can bring before it" and "guides and focuses the jury's objective consideration of the particularized circumstances of the individual offense and the individual offender before it can impose a sentence of death." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*810&lt;/span&gt; 273-274 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). Then, while purporting to distinguish, rather than to overrule, &lt;i&gt;Jurek,&lt;/i&gt; this Court in &lt;i&gt;Penry I&lt;/i&gt; determined that the same Texas statute was constitutionally insufficient by not permitting jurors to give effect to mitigating evidence. 492 U. S., at 328. See also &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 355-356 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (explaining how &lt;i&gt;Penry I&lt;/i&gt; contradicts &lt;i&gt;Jurek&lt;/i&gt; `s conclusions). According to the Court, an instruction informing the jury that it could give effect to the mitigating evidence was necessary. 492 U. S., at 328. And in today's decision, this Court yet again has second-guessed itself and decided that even this supplemental instruction is not constitutionally sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1]   Another recent development in Texas is the passage of a bill banning the execution of mentally retarded persons. See Babineck, Perry: Death-penalty measure needs analyzing, Dallas Morning News, May 31, 2001, p. 27A. As this opinion goes to press, Texas Governor Rick Perry is still in the process of deciding whether to sign the bill. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  The special issues are:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"`(1)whether the conduct of the defendant that caused the death of the deceased was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased or another would result;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"`(2)whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"`(3)if raised by the evidence, whether the conduct of the defendant in killing the deceased was unreasonable in response to the provocation, if any, by the deceased.' " &lt;i&gt;Penry I,&lt;/i&gt; 492 U. S. 302, 310 (1989) (quoting Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071(b) (Vernon 1981 and Supp. 1989)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]  This Court's suggestion that the Texas court may have believed that any supplemental instruction,regardless of its substance, would satisfy &lt;i&gt;Penry I&lt;/i&gt; `s requirement, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 796-797, is specious. The Texas court explained that a "jury must be given a special instruction &lt;i&gt;in order to allow it to consider and give effect to such evidence&lt;/i&gt; "; itquoted the full text of the supplemental instruction; and it concluded that "a nullification instruction &lt;i&gt;such as this one&lt;/i&gt; is sufficient to meet the constitutional requirements of &lt;i&gt;[&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Penry I]&lt;/i&gt; ." &lt;i&gt;Penry&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;State,&lt;/i&gt; 903 S. W. 2d 715, 765 (1995) (emphasis added). It is quite obvious that the court based its legal conclusion on the content of the supplemental instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  I am still bewildered as to why this Court finds it unconstitutional for Texas to limit consideration of mitigating evidence to those factors relevant to the three special issues. See &lt;i&gt;Graham&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Collins,&lt;/i&gt; 506 U. S. 461, 478 (1993) (Thomas, J., concurring). But we need not address this broader issue to uphold Penry's sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  I think we need not look beyond the court's instructions in evaluating the Texas appellate court's decision. But even if there were any doubt as to whether the instruction led the jurors to believe there was a vehicle for giving mitigating effect to Penry's evidence, the instruction was made clear "`in the light of all that ha[d] taken place at the trial.' " &lt;i&gt;Johnson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Texas,&lt;/i&gt; 509 U. S. 350, 368 (1993). The judge and prosecutor fully explained how to give effect to mitigating evidence during the &lt;i&gt;voir dire&lt;/i&gt; process, and defense counsel made the instruction clear in closing: "[i]f, when you thought about mental retardation and the child abuse, you think that this guy deserves a life sentence, and not a death sentence, . . . then, you get to answer one of . . . those questions no," App. 640. Even if the jurors had forgotten what they had been told at &lt;i&gt;voir dire,&lt;/i&gt; see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 801-802, an assumption that I find questionable given our presumptions about jurors' ability to remember and follow instructions, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Weeks&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Angelone,&lt;/i&gt; 528 U. S. 225, 234 (2000), the defense counsel's explanation from closing arguments would have been fresh on their minds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the Court's assertion that defense counsel told the jurors to answer the questions dishonestly, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 802, it seems to me that the jurors reasonably could have believed that they could honestly answer any question "no" if they found that the death sentence would be inappropriate given the mitigating evidence. They could follow their "`oath, the evidence and the law,' " &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; (quoting the prosecutor's statement, App. 616), by truthfully concluding that the evidence of Penry's childhood and mental status did not warrant the death penalty and by writing "no" next to one of the special issues.&lt;/p&gt;

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*845&lt;/span&gt; Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except O'Connor, J., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kathleen L. Caldwell&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for petitioner. With her on the briefs was &lt;i&gt;Eric Schnapper.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matthew D. Roberts&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States et al. as &lt;i&gt;amici curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal. With him on the brief were &lt;i&gt;Acting Solicitor General Underwood, Acting Assistant Attorney General Yeomans, Austin C. Schlick, Dennis J. Dimsey, Jennifer Levin, Gwendolyn Young Reams, Phillip B. Sklover, Carolyn L. Wheeler,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Caren I. Friedman.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*845&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Raymond Michael Ripple&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was &lt;i&gt;Donna L. Goodman.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Thomas, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case presents the question whether a front pay award is an element of compensatory damages under the Civil Rights Act of 1991. We conclude that it is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioner Sharon Pollard sued her former employer, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont), alleging that she had been subjected to a hostile work environment based on her sex, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000e &lt;i&gt;et seq.&lt;/i&gt; After a trial, the District Court found that Pollard was subjected to coworker sexual harassment of which her supervisors were aware. The District Court further found that the harassment resulted in a medical leave of absence from her job for psychological assistance and her eventual dismissal for refusing to return to the same hostile work environment. The court awarded Pollard $107,364 in backpay and benefits, $252,997 in attorney's fees, and, as relevant here, $300,000 in compensatory damages&#151;the maximum permitted under the statutory cap for such damages in 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1981a(b)(3). &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*846&lt;/span&gt; The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the record demonstrated that DuPont employees engaged in flagrant discrimination based on sex and that DuPont managers and supervisors did not take adequate steps to stop it. 213 F. 3d 933 (CA6 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue presented for review here is whether front pay constitutes an element of "compensatory damages" under 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1981a and thus is subject to the statutory damages cap imposed by that section. Although courts have defined "front pay" in numerous ways, front pay issimply money awarded for lost compensation during the period between judgment and reinstatement or in lieu of reinstatement. For instance, when an appropriate position for the plaintiff is not immediately available without displacing an incumbent employee, courts have ordered reinstatement upon the opening of such a position and have ordered front pay to be paid until reinstatement occurs. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Walsdorf&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Board of Comm'rs,&lt;/i&gt; 857 F. 2d 1047, 1053-1054 (CA5 1988); &lt;i&gt;King&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Staley,&lt;/i&gt; 849 F. 2d 1143, 1145 (CA8 1988). In cases in which reinstatement is not viable because of continuing hostility between the plaintiff and the employer or its workers, or because of psychological injuries suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the discrimination, courts have ordered front pay as a substitute for reinstatement. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gotthardt&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;National R. R. Passenger Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 191 F. 3d 1148, 1156 (CA9 1999); &lt;i&gt;Fitzgerald&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sirloin Stockade, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 624 F. 2d 945, 957 (CA10 1980). For the purposes of this opinion, it is not necessary for us to explain when front pay is an appropriate remedy. The question before us is only whether front pay, if found to be appropriate, is an element of compensatory damages under the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and thus subject to the Act's statutory cap on such damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the District Court observed that "the $300,000.00 award is, in fact, insufficient to compensate plaintiff," &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/tnwd/dBtX/pollard-v-ei-dupont-de-nemours-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;913&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 924, n. 19 (WD Tenn. 1998), but it stated that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*847&lt;/span&gt; it was bound by the Sixth Circuit's decision in &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Reno,&lt;/i&gt; 130 F. 3d 1193 (1997), which held that front pay was subject to the cap. On appeal, Pollard argued that &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt;  was wrongly decided because front pay is not an element of compensatory damages, but rather a replacement for the remedy of reinstatement in situations in which reinstatement would be inappropriate. She also argued that &#167; 1981a, by its very terms, explicitly excludes from the statutory cap remedies that traditionally were available under Title VII, which she argued included front pay. The Court of Appeals agreed with Pollard's arguments but considered itself bound by &lt;i&gt;Hudson.&lt;/i&gt; The Sixth Circuit declined to rehear the case en banc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sixth Circuit's decision in &lt;i&gt;Hudson&lt;/i&gt; was one of the first appellate opinions to decide whether front pay is an element of compensatory damages subject to the statutory cap set forth in &#167; 1981a(b)(3). Contrary to the Sixth Circuit's resolution of this question, the other Courts of Appeals to address it have concluded that front pay is a remedy that is not subject to the limitations of &#167; 1981a(b)(3). See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pals&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Schepel Buick &amp;amp; GMC Truck, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 220 F. 3d 495, 499-500 (CA7 2000); &lt;i&gt;Kramer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Logan County School Dist. No. R-1,&lt;/i&gt;  157 F. 3d 620, 625-626 (CA8 1998); &lt;i&gt;Gotthardt, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 1153&#151; 1154; &lt;i&gt;Medlock&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ortho Biotech, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 164 F. 3d 545, 556 (CA10 1999); &lt;i&gt;EEOC&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;W&amp;amp;O, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 213 F. 3d 600, 619, n. 10 (CA11 2000); &lt;i&gt;Martini&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Federal Nat. Mortgage Assn.,&lt;/i&gt; 178 F. 3d 1336, 1348-1349 (CADC 1999). We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict. 531 U. S. 1069 (2001).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs who allege employment discrimination on the basis of sex traditionally have been entitled to such remedies as injunctions, reinstatement, backpay, lost benefits, and attorney's fees under &#167; 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*848&lt;/span&gt; of 1964. 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000e&#151;5(g)(1). In the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress expanded the remedies available to these plaintiffs by permitting, for the first time, the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages. 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1981a(a)(1) ("[T]he complaining party may recover compensatory and punitive damages as allowed in subsection (b) of this section, in addition to any relief authorized by section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964"). The amount of compensatory damages awarded under &#167; 1981a for "future pecuniary losses, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other nonpecuniary losses," and the amount of punitive damages awarded under &#167; 1981a, however, may not exceed the statutory cap set forth in &#167; 1981a(b)(3). The statutory cap is based on the number of people employed by the respondent. In this case, the cap is $300,000 because DuPont has more than 500 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sixth Circuit has concluded that front pay constitutes compensatory damages awarded for future pecuniary losses and thus is subject to the statutory cap of &#167; 1981a(b)(3). 213 F. 3d, at 945; &lt;i&gt;Hudson, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 1203. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that front pay is not an element of compensatory damages within the meaning of &#167; 1981a, and, therefore, we hold that the statutory cap of &#167; 1981a(b)(3) is inapplicable to front pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under &#167; 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as originally enacted, when a court found that an employer had intentionally engaged in an unlawful employment practice, the court was authorized to "enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful employment practice, and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without back pay." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000e&#151; 5(g)(1). This provision closely tracked the language of &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*849&lt;/span&gt; &#167; 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 49 Stat. 454, 29 U. S. C. &#167; 160(c), which similarly authorized orders requiring employers to take appropriate, remedial "affirmative action." &#167; 160(c) (authorizing the National Labor Relations Board to issue an order "requiring such person to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice, and to take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this subchapter"). See also &lt;i&gt;Albemarle Paper Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Moody,&lt;/i&gt; 422 U. S. 405, 419, n. 11 (1975). The meaning of this provision of the NLRA prior to enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, therefore, gives us guidance as to the proper meaning of the same language in &#167; 706(g) of Title VII. In applying &#167; 10(c) of the NLRA, the Board consistently had made awards of what it called "backpay" up to the date the employee was reinstated or returned to the position he should have been in had the violation of the NLRA not occurred, even if such event occurred after judgment. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nathanson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;NLRB,&lt;/i&gt; 344 U. S. 25, 29-30 (1952); &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Reeves Broadcasting &amp;amp; Development Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 336 F. 2d 590, 593-594 (CA4 1964); &lt;i&gt;NLRB&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hill &amp;amp; Hill Truck Line, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 266 F. 2d 883, 887 (CA5 1959); &lt;i&gt;Berger Polishing, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt;  147 N. L. R. B. 21, 40 (1964); &lt;i&gt;Lock Joint Pipe Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 141 N. L. R. B. 943, 948 (1963). Consistent with the Board's interpretation of this provision of the NLRA, courts finding unlawful intentional discrimination in Title VII actions awarded this same type of backpay under &#167; 706(g). See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Culpepper&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Reynolds Metals Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 442 F. 2d 1078, 1080 (CA5 1971); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Georgia Power Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 3 FEP Cases 767, 790 (ND Ga. 1971). In the Title VII context, this form of "backpay" occurring after the date of judgment is known today as "front pay."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1972, Congress expanded &#167; 706(g) to specify that a court could, in addition to awarding those remedies previously listed in the provision, award "any other equitable relief &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*850&lt;/span&gt; as the court deems appropriate." After this amendment to &#167; 706(g), courts endorsed a broad view of front pay. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Patterson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;American Tobacco Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 535 F. 2d 257, 269 (CA4 1976) (stating that where reinstatement is not immediately feasible, backpay "should be supplemented by an award equal to the estimated present value of lost earnings that are reasonably likely to occur between the date of judgment and the time when the employee can assume his new position"); &lt;i&gt;EEOC&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Enterprise Assn. Steamfitters,&lt;/i&gt; 542 F. 2d 579, 590 (CA2 1976) (stating that backpay award would terminate on the date of actual remedying of discrimination); &lt;i&gt;Bush&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lone Star Steel Co.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/txed/bKGZ/bush-v-lone-star-steel-company/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;373&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;526&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 538 (ED Tex. 1974) (ordering backpay from the date the employee would have been entitled to fill a vacancy but for racial discrimination to the date the employee would in all reasonable probability reach his rightful place). Courts recognized that reinstatement was not always a viable option, and that an award of front pay as a substitute for reinstatement in such cases was a necessary part of the "make whole" relief mandated by Congress and by this Court in &lt;i&gt;Albemarle.&lt;/i&gt; See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shore&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Federal Express Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 777 F. 2d 1155, 1158&#151; 1159 (CA6 1985) ("Front pay is . . . simply compensation for the post-judgment effects of past discrimination." It is awarded "to effectuate fully the `make whole' purposes of Title VII"); &lt;i&gt;Brooks&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Woodline Motor Freight, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 852 F. 2d 1061, 1066 (CA8 1988) (stating that front pay was appropriate given substantial animosity between parties where "the parties' relationship was not likely to improve, and the nature of the business required a high degree of mutual trust and confidence"); &lt;i&gt;Fitzgerald&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Sirloin Stockade, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 624 F. 2d, at 957 (upholding award of front pay where continuing hostility existed between the parties); &lt;i&gt;Cassino&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Reichhold Chems., Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 817 F. 2d 1338, 1347 (CA9 1987) (same). By 1991, virtually all of the courts of appeals had recognized that "front pay" was a remedy authorized &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*851&lt;/span&gt; under &#167; 706(g).&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; In fact, no court of appeals appears to have ever held to the contrary.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1991, without amending &#167; 706(g), Congress further expanded the remedies available in cases of intentional employment discrimination to include compensatory and punitive damages. See 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1981a(a)(1). At that time, Rev. Stat. &#167; 1977, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1981, permitted the recovery of unlimited compensatory and punitive damages in cases of intentional race and ethnic discrimination, but no similar remedy existed in cases of intentional sex, religious, or disability discrimination. Thus, &#167; 1981a brought all forms of intentional employment discrimination into alignment, at least with respect to the forms of relief available to successful plaintiffs. However, compensatory and punitive damages awarded under &#167; 1981a may not exceed the statutory limitations set forth in &#167; 1981a(b)(3), while such damages awarded under &#167; 1981 are not limited by statute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*852&lt;/span&gt; B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the abstract, front pay could be considered compensation for "future pecuniary losses," in which case it would be subject to the statutory cap. &#167; 1981a(b)(3). The term "compensatory damages . . . for future pecuniary losses" is not defined in the statute, and, out of context, its ordinary meaning could include all payments for monetary losses after the date of judgment. However, we must not analyze one term of &#167; 1981a in isolation. See &lt;i&gt;Gade&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;National Solid Wastes Management Assn.,&lt;/i&gt; 505 U. S. 88, 99 (1992) ("`[W]e must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law' "). When &#167; 1981a is read as a whole, the better interpretation is that front pay is not within the meaning of compensatory damages in &#167; 1981a(b)(3), and thus front pay is excluded from the statutory cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress determined that victims of employment discrimination were entitled to &lt;i&gt;additional&lt;/i&gt; remedies. Congress expressly found that "additional remedies under Federal law are needed to deter unlawful harassment and intentional discrimination in the workplace," without giving any indication that it wished to curtail previously available remedies. See Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1071, &#167; 2. Congress therefore made clear through the plain language of the statute that the remedies newly authorized under &#167; 1981a were &lt;i&gt;in addition to&lt;/i&gt; the relief authorized by &#167; 706(g). Section 1981a(a)(1) provides that, in intentional discrimination cases brought under Title VII, "the complaining party may recover compensatory and punitive damages as allowed in subjection (b) of [&#167; 1981a], &lt;i&gt;in addition to any relief authorized by section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,&lt;/i&gt; from the respondent." (Emphasis added.) And &#167; 1981a(b)(2) states that "[c]ompensatory damages awarded under [&#167; 1981a] shall not include backpay, interest on backpay, &lt;i&gt;or any other type of relief authorized under section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&lt;/i&gt; " &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*853&lt;/span&gt; (Emphasis added.) According to these statutory provisions, if front pay was a type of relief authorized under &#167; 706(g), it is excluded from the meaning of compensatory damages under &#167; 1981a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As discussed above, the original language of &#167; 706(g) authorizing backpay awards was modeled after the same language in the NLRA. This provision in the NLRA had been construed to allow awards of backpay up to the date of reinstatement, even if reinstatement occurred after judgment. Accordingly, backpay awards made for the period between the date of judgment and the date of reinstatement, which today are called front pay awards under Title VII, were authorized under &#167; 706(g).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to front pay awards that are made in lieu of reinstatement, we construe &#167; 706(g) as authorizing these awards as well. We see no logical difference between front pay awards made when there eventually is reinstatement and those made when there is not.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Moreover, to distinguish between the two cases would lead to the strange result that employees could receive front pay when reinstatement eventually is available but not when reinstatement is not an option&#151;whether because of continuing hostility between the plaintiff and the employer or its workers, or because of psychological injuries that the discrimination has caused the plaintiff. Thus, the most egregious offenders could be subject to the least sanctions. Had Congress drawn such a line in the statute and foreclosed front pay awards in lieu of reinstatement, we certainly would honor that line. But, as written, the text of the statute does not lend itself to such a distinction, and we will not create one. The statute &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*854&lt;/span&gt; authorizes courts to "order such affirmative action as may be appropriate." 42 U. S. C. &#167; 2000e&#151;5(g)(1). We conclude that front pay awards in lieu of reinstatement fit within this statutory term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because front pay is a remedy authorized under &#167; 706(g), Congress did not limit the availability of such awards in &#167; 1981a. Instead, Congress sought to expand the available remedies by permitting the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages in addition to previously available remedies, such as front pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;* * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice O'Connor took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.&lt;/p&gt;

See also &lt;i&gt;McKnight&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;General Motors Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 908 F. 2d 104, 116-117 (CA7 1990) (reserving question of availability of front pay under Title VII); &lt;i&gt;Wildman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lerner Stores Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 771 F. 2d 605, 615-616 (CA1 1985) (holding that front pay is available under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, but relying on Title VII case law).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The only two Courts of Appeals not to have addressed this issue prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1991 have since joined the other Circuits in holding that front pay is a remedy available under &#167; 706(g).See &lt;i&gt;Selgas&lt;/i&gt;  v.&lt;i&gt;American Airlines, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 104 F. 3d 9, 12-13 (CA1 1997);&lt;i&gt;Williams&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pharmacia, Inc.,&lt;/i&gt; 137 F. 3d 944, 951-952 (CA7 1998).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  We note that the federal courts consistently have construed &#167; 706(g) as authorizing front pay awards in lieu of reinstatement. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blum&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Witco Chem. Corp., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 383 ("A front pay . . . award is the monetary equivalent of the equitable remedy of reinstatement"); &lt;i&gt;Williams&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pharmacia, Inc., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 952 (stating that "front pay is the functional equivalent of reinstatement").&lt;/p&gt;

ON EXCEPTIONS TO REPORT OF SPECIAL MASTER
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*3&lt;/span&gt; Stevens, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, Parts I, IV, and V of which were unanimous, and Parts II and III of which were joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Kennedy, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*4&lt;/span&gt; JJ. O'Connor, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which Scalia and Thomas, JJ., joined, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;John B. Draper,&lt;/i&gt; Special Assistant Attorney General of Kansas, argued the cause for plaintiff. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Carla J. Stovall,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, &lt;i&gt;John W. Campbell,&lt;/i&gt; Chief Deputy Attorney General, &lt;i&gt;John M. Cassidy,&lt;/i&gt;  Assistant Attorney General, &lt;i&gt;Leland E. Rolfs,&lt;/i&gt; Special Assistant Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;Andrew S. Montgomery.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jeffrey P. Minear&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for intervenor United States. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Schiffer, Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Patricia Weiss.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;David W. Robbins,&lt;/i&gt; Special Assistant Attorney General of Colorado, argued the cause for defendant. With him on the briefs were &lt;i&gt;Ken Salazar,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General, &lt;i&gt;Carol D. Angel,&lt;/i&gt;  Senior Assistant Attorney General, and &lt;i&gt;Dennis M. Montgomery,&lt;/i&gt; Special Assistant Attorney General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arkansas River rises in the mountains of Colorado just east of the Continental Divide, descends for about 280 miles to the Kansas border, then flows through that State, Oklahoma, and Arkansas and empties into the Mississippi River. On May 20, 1901, Kansas first invoked this Court's original jurisdiction to seek a remedy for Colorado's diversion of water from the Arkansas River. See &lt;i&gt;Kansas&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Colorado,&lt;/i&gt; 185 U. S. 125, 126 (1902) (statement of case). In opinions written during the past century, most recently in &lt;i&gt;Kansas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Colorado,&lt;/i&gt; 514 U. S. 673, 675-678 (1995), we have described the history and the importance of the river. For present purposes it suffices to note that two of those cases, &lt;i&gt;Kansas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Colorado,&lt;/i&gt; 206 U. S. 46 (1907), and &lt;i&gt;Colorado&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kansas,&lt;/i&gt; 320 U. S. 383 (1943), led to the negotiation of the Arkansas River Compact (Compact), an agreement between Kansas and Colorado that in turn was approved by Congress in 1949. See 63 Stat. 145. The case before us today involves &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*5&lt;/span&gt; a claim by Kansas for damages based on Colorado's violations of that Compact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Compact was designed to "[s]ettle existing disputes and remove causes of future controversy" between the two States and their citizens concerning waters of the Arkansas River and to "[e]quitably divide and apportion" those waters and the benefits arising from construction and operation of the federal project known as the "John Martin Reservoir." Arkansas River Compact, Art. I, reprinted in App. to Brief for Kansas A-1, A-2. Article IV&#151;D of the Compact provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This Compact is not intended to impede or prevent future beneficial development of the Arkansas River basin in Colorado and Kansas by Federal or State agencies, by private enterprise, or by combinations thereof, which may involve construction of dams, reservoir, and other works for the purpose of water utilization and control, as well as the improved or prolonged functioning of existing works: Provided, that the waters of the Arkansas River, as defined in Article III, shall not be materially depleted in usable quantity or availability for use to the water users in Colorado and Kansas under this Compact by such future development or construction." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at A-5.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the proviso to that paragraph that is of special relevance to this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1986, we granted Kansas leave to file a complaint alleging three violations of the Compact by Colorado. See 514 U. S., at 679-680. After taking evidence in the liability phase of the proceeding, Special Master Arthur L. Littleworth filed his first report, in which he recommended that two of the claims be denied, but that the Court find that post-Compact increases in groundwater well pumping in Colorado had materially depleted the waters of the river in violation of Article IV&#151;D. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 680. We overruled &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*6&lt;/span&gt; Colorado's exceptions to that recommendation, including an argument that Kansas was guilty of laches. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 687-689. We remanded the case to the Special Master to determine an appropriate remedy for the violations of Article IV&#151;D. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 694.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After further proceedings the Special Master filed a second report recommending an award of damages. Colorado filed exceptions to that report, arguing that the Eleventh Amendment barred an award based on losses incurred by Kansas citizens, and that the report improperly recommended the recovery of prejudgment interest on an unliquidated claim. We overruled those exceptions without prejudice to their renewal after the Special Master made a more specific recommendation for a remedy. 522 U. S. 1073 (1998). He did so in his third report, and we are now confronted with exceptions filed by both States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third report, the Special Master recommends that damages be measured by Kansas' losses, rather than Colorado's profits, attributable to Compact violations after 1950; that the damages be paid in money rather than water; and that the damages should include prejudgment interest from 1969 to the date of judgment. Colorado has filed four objections to the report. It contends (1) that the recommended award of damages would violate the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution; (2) that the damages award should not include prejudgment interest; (3) that the amount of interest awarded is excessive; and (4) that the Special Master improperly credited flawed expert testimony, with the result that Kansas' crop production losses were improperly calculated. On the other hand, Kansas has filed an objection submitting that prejudgment interest should be paid from 1950, rather than 1969. The United States, which intervened because of its interest in the operation of flood control projects in Colorado, submits that both States' objections should be overruled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*7&lt;/span&gt; I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have decided that a State may recover monetary damages from another State in an original action, without running afoul of the Eleventh Amendment.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Texas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New Mexico,&lt;/i&gt; 482 U. S. 124, 130 (1987) ("The Court has recognized the propriety of money judgments against a State in an original action, and specifically in a case involving a compact. In proper original actions, the Eleventh Amendment is no barrier, for by its terms, it applies only to suits by citizens against a State" (citations omitted)); see also &lt;i&gt;Maryland&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Louisiana,&lt;/i&gt; 451 U. S. 725, 745, n. 21 (1981); &lt;i&gt;South Dakota&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;North Carolina,&lt;/i&gt; 192 U. S. 286, 317-321 (1904). Colorado contends, however, that the Eleventh Amendment precludes any such recovery based on losses sustained by individual water users in Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is firmly established, and undisputed in this litigation, that the text of the Eleventh Amendment would bar a direct action against Colorado by citizens of Kansas. Moreover, we have several times held that a State may not invoke our original jurisdiction when it is merely acting as an agent or trustee for one or more of its citizens. For example, in &lt;i&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Louisiana,&lt;/i&gt; 108 U. S. 76 (1883), we refused to assume jurisdiction over an action to recover payment on defaulted bonds that had been formally assigned to the state plaintiffs but remained beneficially owned by private individuals. And, in &lt;i&gt;North Dakota&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Minnesota,&lt;/i&gt;  263 U. S. 365 (1923), we held that, while the plaintiff State could obtain an injunction against the improper operation of Minnesota's drainage ditches, the Eleventh Amendment precluded an award of damages based on injuries to individual farmers, where the damages claim was financed by &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*8&lt;/span&gt; contributions from the farmers and the State had committed to dividing any recovery among the farmers "in proportion to the amount of [their] loss." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 375.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those cases make it clear that a "State is not permitted to enter a controversy as a nominal party in order to forward the claims of individual citizens." &lt;i&gt;Maryland&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Louisiana,&lt;/i&gt;  451 U. S., at 737; see also &lt;i&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Louisiana,&lt;/i&gt; 108 U. S., at 89 (Eleventh Amendment applies and acts to bar jurisdiction where "the State and the attorney-general are only nominal actors in the proceeding"). The "governing principle" is that in order to invoke our original jurisdiction, "the State must show a direct interest of its own and not merely seek recovery for the benefit of individuals who are the real parties in interest." &lt;i&gt;Oklahoma ex rel. Johnson&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cook,&lt;/i&gt; 304 U. S. 387, 396 (1938).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kansas has unquestionably made such a showing. Indeed, the present proceeding is but one of several in which Kansas' own interest in preventing upstream diversions from the Arkansas River has justified an exercise of our original jurisdiction. In &lt;i&gt;Cook&lt;/i&gt; we even offered as an example of proper original jurisdiction one of the prior original suits between Kansas and Colorado, see &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 393-394 (citing &lt;i&gt;Kansas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Colorado,&lt;/i&gt; 206 U. S. 46 (1907)), and in &lt;i&gt;Texas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New Mexico&lt;/i&gt;  we held that enforcement of an interstate water compact by means of a recovery of money damages can be within a State's proper pursuit of the "general public interest" in an original action, 482 U. S., at 132, n. 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the record in this case plainly discloses that the State of Kansas has been in full control of this litigation since its inception. Its right to control the disposition of any recovery of damages is entirely unencumbered. The injury to individual farmers is but one component of the formula adopted by the Special Master to quantify the damages caused by Colorado's violation of its contractual obligations. In short, there is simply nothing in the record to suggest that the State of Kansas is merely a "nominal party" to this &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*9&lt;/span&gt; litigation or that the individual farmers are "the real parties in interest."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a State properly invokes our jurisdiction to seek redress for a wrong perpetrated against it by a sister State, neither the measure of damages that we ultimately determine to be proper nor our method for calculating those damages can retrospectively negate our jurisdiction. Nor would our jurisdiction to order a damages remedy be affected by Kansas' postjudgment decisions concerning the use of the money recovered from Colorado. As we have previously recognized, it is the State's prerogative either to deposit the proceeds of any judgment in "the general coffers of the State" or to use them to "benefit those who were hurt." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We overrule Colorado's first exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado next excepts to the Special Master's conclusion that the damages award should include prejudgment interest despite the fact that Kansas' claim is unliquidated.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; At one point in time, the fact that the claim was unliquidated would have been of substantial importance. As a general matter, early common-law cases drew a distinction between liquidated and unliquidated claims and refused to allow interest on the latter. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.,&lt;/i&gt; Comment, Prejudgment Interest: &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*10&lt;/span&gt; Survey and Suggestion, 77 Nw. U. L. Rev. 192, 196, and n. 26 (1982) (discussing history and collecting sources). This rule seems to have rested upon a belief that there was something inherently unfair about requiring debtors to pay interest when they were unable to halt its accrual by handing over to their creditors a fixed and unassailable amount. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 196.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This common-law distinction has long since lost its hold on the legal imagination. Beginning in the early part of the last century, numerous courts and commentators have rejected the distinction for failing to acknowledge the compensatory nature of interest awards.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; This Court allied itself with the evolving consensus in 1933, when we expressed the opinion that the distinction between cases of liquidated and unliquidated damages "is not a sound one." &lt;i&gt;Funkhouser&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;J. B. Preston Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 290 U. S. 163, 168 (1933). The analysis supporting that conclusion gave no doubt as to our reasoning: "Whether the case is of the one class or the other, the injured party has suffered a loss which may be regarded as not fully compensated if he is confined to the amount found to be recoverable as of the time of breach and nothing is added for the delay in obtaining the award of damages." &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; Our cases since 1933 have consistently acknowledged that a monetary award does not fully compensate for an injury unless it includes an interest component. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Milwaukee&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cement Div., National Gypsum Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 515 U. S. 189, 195 (1995) ("The essential rationale for awarding prejudgment &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*11&lt;/span&gt; interest is to ensure that an injured party is fully compensated for its loss"); &lt;i&gt;West Virginia&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt;  479 U. S. 305, 310-311, n. 2 (1987); &lt;i&gt;General Motors Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Devex Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 461 U. S. 648, 655-656, n. 10 (1983).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relying on our cases, the Special Master "concluded that the unliquidated nature of Kansas' money damages does not, in and of itself, bar an award of prejudgment interest." Second Report, &#167; XV, reprinted in App. to Third Report 43. In reaching that conclusion, the Special Master was fully cognizant of both the displaced common-law rule and the subsequent doctrinal evolution. In addition, he gave careful consideration to equitable considerations that might mitigate against an award of interest, concluding that "considerations of fairness," &lt;i&gt;Board of Comm'rs of Jackson Cty.&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 308 U. S. 343, 352 (1939), supported the award of at least some prejudgment interest in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find no fault in the Special Master's analysis of either our prior cases or the equities of this matter. While we will deal with the amount of prejudgment interest below, to answer Colorado's second objection it is sufficient to conclude that the Special Master was correct in determining that the unliquidated nature of the damages does not preclude an award of prejudgment interest.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*12&lt;/span&gt; Colorado's second exception is overruled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado's third exception takes issue with both the rate of interest adopted by the Special Master and the date from which he recommended that interest begin to accrue. As to the second of these two concerns, Colorado submits that, if any prejudgment interest is to be awarded, it should begin to accrue in 1985 (when Kansas filed its complaint in this action), rather than in 1969 (when, the Special Master concluded, Colorado knew or should have known that it was violating the Compact). On the other hand, Kansas has entered an exception, arguing that the accrual of interest should begin in 1950. We first address the rate question, then the timing issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Special Master credited the testimony of Kansas' three experts who calculated the interest rates that they thought necessary to provide full compensation for the damages caused by Colorado's violations of the Compact in the years since 1950. As a result of inflation and changing market conditions those rates varied from year to year. In their calculation of the damages suffered by Kansas farmers, the experts used the interest rates that were applicable to individuals in the relevant years rather than the (lower) rates available to States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*13&lt;/span&gt; Colorado argues that the lower rates should have been used because it is the State, rather than the individual farmers, that is maintaining the action and will receive any award of damages. But if, as we have already decided, see Part I, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; it is permissible for the State to measure a portion of its damages by losses suffered by individual farmers, it necessarily follows that the courts are free to utilize whatever interest rate will most accurately measure those losses. The money in question in this portion of the damages award is revenue that would&#151;but for Colorado's actions&#151;have been earned by individual farmers. Thus, the Special Master correctly concluded that the economic consequences of Colorado's breach could best be remedied by an interest award that mirrors the cost of any additional borrowing the farmers may have been forced to undertake in order to compensate for lost revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Special Master rejected Colorado's submission that there is a categorical bar to the award of prejudgment interest on unliquidated claims, he concluded that such interest should not "be awarded according to [any] rigid theory of compensation for money withheld," but rather should respond to "`considerations of fairness.' " Third Report 97 (quoting &lt;i&gt;Jackson Cty.,&lt;/i&gt; 308 U. S., at 352). Kansas argues that our decisions subsequent to &lt;i&gt;Jackson County&lt;/i&gt;  have effectively foreclosed the equities-balancing approach that the Special Master adopted. There is some merit to Kansas' position. See &lt;i&gt;National Gypsum Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 515 U. S., at 193 (affirming a decision of the Court of Appeals that had read our cases as "disapproving of a `balancing of the equities' as a method of deciding whether to allow prejudgment interest").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite the clear direction indicated by some of our earlier opinions, we cannot say that by 1949 our case law had developed sufficiently to put Colorado on notice &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*14&lt;/span&gt; that, upon a violation of the Compact, we would automatically award prejudgment interest from the time of injury. Given the state of the law at that time, Colorado may well have believed that we would balance the equities in order to achieve a just and equitable remedy, rather than automatically imposing prejudgment interest in order to achieve full compensation. See &lt;i&gt;Jackson Cty.,&lt;/i&gt; 308 U. S., at 352 (prejudgment interest award limited by "considerations of fairness"); &lt;i&gt;Miller&lt;/i&gt; v.&lt;i&gt;Robertson,&lt;/i&gt; 266 U. S. 243, 258 (1924) ("[W]hen necessary in order to arrive at fair compensation, the court in the exercise of a sound discretion may include interest or its equivalent as an element of damages" on unliquidated claims); Restatement of Contracts &#167; 337, p. 542 (1932) (prejudgment interest on unliquidated claims "may be allowed in the discretion of the court, if justice requires it"). While we are confident that, when it signed the Compact, Colorado was on notice that it might be subject to prejudgment interest if such interest was necessary to fashion an equitable remedy, we are unable to conclude with sufficient certainty that Colorado was on notice that such interest would be imposed as a matter of course. We, therefore, believe that the Special Master acted properly in carefully analyzing the facts of the case and in only awarding as much prejudgment interest as was required by a balancing of the equities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also agree with the Special Master that the equities in this case do not support an award of prejudgment interest from the date of the first violation of the Compact, but rather favor an award beginning on a later date. In reaching this conclusion, the Special Master appropriately considered several factors. In particular, he relied on the fact that in the early years after the Compact was signed, no one had any thought that the pact was being violated. Third Report 106. In addition, he considered the long interval that passed between the original injuries and these proceedings, as well as the dramatic impact of compounding interest over many years. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 99-101; see also n. 3, &lt;i&gt;supra.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*15&lt;/span&gt; In its exception, Kansas argues that the Special Master's reasoning would be appropriate if damages were being awarded as a form of punishment, but does not justify a refusal to provide full compensation to an injured party. Moreover, Kansas argues, a rule that rewards ignorance might discourage diligence in making sure that there is full compliance with the terms of the Compact. Kansas' argument is consistent with a "rigid theory of compensation for money withheld," but, for the reasons discussed above, we are persuaded that the Special Master correctly declined to adopt such a theory. The equitable considerations identified by the Special Master fully justify his view that in this case it would be inappropriate to award prejudgment interest for any years before either party was aware of the excessive pumping in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its third exception, Colorado argues that, if prejudgment interest is to be awarded at all, the equities are best balanced by limiting such interest to the time after the complaint was filed, rather than the time after which Colorado knew or should have known that it was violating the Compact. Specifically, Colorado suggests that prejudgment interest should begin to accrue in 1985 rather than 1969. The choice between the two dates is surely debatable; it is a matter over which reasonable people can&#151;and do&#151;disagree. After examining the equities for ourselves, however, a majority of the Court has decided that the later date is the more appropriate.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*16&lt;/span&gt; When we overruled Colorado's objections to the Special Master's first report, we held that Kansas was not guilty of inexcusable delay in failing to complain more promptly about post-Compact well pumping. 514 U. S., at 687-689. In saying that the delay was not inexcusable, we recognized that the nature and extent of Colorado's violations continued to be unclear even in the years after which it became obvious that the Compact was being violated. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 688-689. That conclusion is something of a two-edged sword, however. While Kansas' delay was understandable given the amorphous nature of its claims, there is no doubt that the interests of both States would have been served if the claim had been advanced promptly after its basis became known. Once it became obvious that a violation of the Compact had occurred, it was equally clear that the proceedings necessary to evaluate the significance of the violations would be complex and protracted. Despite the diligence of the parties and the Special Master, over 15 years have elapsed since the complaint was filed. Given the uncertainty over the scope of damages that prevailed during the period between 1968 and 1985 and the fact that it was uniquely in Kansas' power to begin the process by which those damages would be quantified, Colorado's request that we deny prejudgment interest for that period is reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, we overrule Kansas' exception. We also overrule Colorado's third exception insofar as it challenges the interest rates recommended by the Special Master, but we sustain that objection insofar as it challenges the award of interest for the years prior to 1985.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado's final objection challenges the Special Master's determination of the value of the crop losses attributable to the Compact violations, the largest component of Kansas' damages claim. The Special Master accomplished the calculation by estimating the amount of farmland affected by &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*17&lt;/span&gt; Colorado's violations, the crops planted on that farmland, the price of those crops, and the difference in yield between what the affected land would have produced with the additional water and what the land actually produced with the water it received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parties were in agreement concerning most of the facts bearing on the Special Master's calculation. They agreed that water was in short supply in the affected area each year, 178 Tr. 127-128; they agreed on the amount of the shortage that resulted from Colorado's violations, &lt;i&gt;ibid.;&lt;/i&gt; and they generally agreed on which crops were planted on the affected farmland as well as the prices of those crops in the relevant years. See Third Report 46.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only issue on which the parties disagreed was the exact effect of the diverted water on the crop yields for the farmland in question. On that score, both Kansas and Colorado accepted the general notion that "[u]p to the point where crops no longer can make use of additional water, more water produces more crop yield." &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 47. But they parted ways on the question of precisely how much additional yield would have been produced with the missing water.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; Kansas' experts relied upon the hypothesis of a generally linear relationship between water available for &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*18&lt;/span&gt; use and increased crop yields. With figures drawn from a number of studies, Professor Norman Whittlesey, Kansas' principal expert,&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; developed quantitative estimates of the lost yield, per unit of water, for the various crops grown on the affected farmland. Although Colorado's expert initially attempted to propose his own model, he ultimately abandoned his position when confronted with flaws in his data. 197 Tr. 44-46.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its own expert having recanted his alternative proposal for calculating the effects of the diverted water on crop yield, Colorado attempts to poke holes in Kansas' methodology through a speculative application of abstract economic theory. Kansas' numbers (for crop losses due to diverted water) cannot be correct, Colorado argues, because if they were, it would have been economically profitable for the affected farmers to drill wells and obtain water from underground sources rather than suffer the reduced yield from the shortage of surface water. Brief for Colorado 41-49. Because Kansas farmers did not install wells, Colorado concludes, we can know that the diverted water was not as valuable as Kansas' experts claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Special Master did not question Colorado's assertion that digging wells would, in retrospect, actually have been profitable for Kansas farmers, but he declined to employ Colorado's argument as a basis for rejecting Kansas' expert testimony on the extent of crop losses. His thoughtful analysis is worth quoting in full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Given the hindsight of present day economists, it might have been profitable for everyone to drill supplemental wells . . .. However, there are many reasons why this may not have been done, and the failure to drill wells does not by itself indicate that Kansas' &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*19&lt;/span&gt; estimate of crop losses is too high. The favorable economics of drilling wells may not have been understood at the time. Quality information regarding costs and returns was not readily available. [211 Tr.] 31. Some farmers, for reasons of age or otherwise, may not have wanted to go into long-term debt. Some farmers may not have had the available capital, or the credit to borrow. Many farmers were `cash poor.' &lt;i&gt;Id.&lt;/i&gt; at 32. Some farmers may have been averse to risk. Some farmers may have been tenants, and the landlord may not have been willing to undertake the necessary investment. Some farms may have been small in terms of total acreage, or the acreage spread out over space, so that it was not feasible or practical to consider a well investment. [208 Tr.] 37-39. Capital for well investments, with three to ten year repayment periods, was less available than for long-term investments. [211 Tr.] 32." Third Report 60-61.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We agree with the Special Master that accepting Colorado's argument requires a good deal of speculation, not only about the comparative advantages of wells as opposed to irrigation, but also about the ability of the farmers fully to understand or to implement different choices without the benefit of expert hindsight. Given Colorado's inability to mount an effective challenge to Kansas' experts on their own terms and its complete failure to provide a plausible alternative estimate of the crop damage that resulted from its violations of the Compact, we conclude that its attack on Kansas' conclusions is unpersuasive.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*20&lt;/span&gt; Colorado's fourth exception is overruled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;V&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We remand the case to the Special Master for preparation of a final judgment consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with the Court's disposition of this case as to Colorado's first and fourth exceptions to the Special Master's Third Report, concerning the award and determination of damages. I therefore join Parts I, IV, and V of the Court's opinion. I do not concur in Parts II and III of the Court's opinion because I believe that the award of prejudgment interest to Kansas, coming over half a century after the Arkansas River Compact's (hereinafter Compact) negotiation and approval, is clearly improper under our precedents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are dealing with an interstate compact apportioning the flow of a river between two States. A compact is a contract. It represents a bargained-for exchange between its signatories and "remains a legal document that must be construed and applied in accordance with its terms." &lt;i&gt;Texas&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;New Mexico,&lt;/i&gt; 482 U. S. 124, 128 (1987); see also &lt;i&gt;Petty&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm'n,&lt;/i&gt; 359 U. S. 275, 285 (1959) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) ("A Compact is, after all, a contract"). It is a fundamental tenet of contract law that parties to a contract are deemed to have contracted with reference to principles of law existing at the time the contract was made. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Norfolk &amp;amp; Western R. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*21&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Train Dispatchers,&lt;/i&gt; 499 U. S. 117, 129-130 (1991); &lt;i&gt;Farmers and Merchants Bank of Monroe&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond,&lt;/i&gt; 262 U. S. 649, 660 (1923); see generally 11 Williston on Contracts &#167; 30:19 (4th ed. 1999). The basic question before the Court is thus one of "the fair intendment of the contract itself." &lt;i&gt;Virginia&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;West Virginia,&lt;/i&gt; 238 U. S. 202, 233 (1915). Specifically, the question is whether, at the time the Compact was negotiated and approved, Colorado and Kansas could fairly be said to have intended, or at least to have expected or assumed, that Colorado might be exposing itself to liability for prejudgment interest in the event of the Compact's breach. Cf. &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 232-236 (awarding interest to Virginia in a suit against West Virginia for breach of a contract to assume "an equitable proportion" of Virginia's interest-bearing public debt upon finding that "there is no escape from the conclusion that there was a contract duty on the part of West Virginia to provide for accruing interest as a part of the equitable proportion assumed").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fail to see how Colorado and Kansas could have contemplated that prejudgment interest would be awarded. The "venerable . . . rule" at common law was that prejudgment interest was unavailable on claims for unliquidated or, even more significantly, unascertainable damages. &lt;i&gt;Milwaukee&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cement Div., National Gypsum Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 515 U. S. 189, 197 (1995). Contrary to the Court's suggestion, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 9-11, 13-14, that rule had not been abandoned by the period between 1943 and 1949, the years of the Compact's negotiation and ultimate approval by Congress. By that time, the state of the law in general regarding awards of prejudgment interest for unliquidated claims was uncertain at best, as the Court itself recognizes. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 9-11, and n. 3; cf. &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt;  at 13-14; see also &lt;i&gt;Funkhouser&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;J. B. Preston Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 290 U. S. 163, 168 (1933) (noting "the numerous, and not harmonious, decisions upon the allowance of interest in the case of unliquidated claims," and that "the rule with respect to unliquidated claims has been in evolution"). To be sure, we had by &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*22&lt;/span&gt; then, along with other courts, criticized the common law rule that prejudgment interest was recoverable on claims for liquidated, but not for unliquidated, damages. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; But in the absence of a statute providing for such interest, many courts, including our own, still denied and would continue to deny prejudgment interest on claims for unliquidated and unascertainable damages in a great many, and probably most, circumstances. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Board of Comm'rs of Jackson Cty.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 308 U. S. 343, 353 (1939); &lt;i&gt;Blau&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Lehman,&lt;/i&gt; 368 U. S. 403, 414 (1962); &lt;i&gt;Lineman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Schmid,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/cal/7pHJ/lineman-v-schmid/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Cal. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;204&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 211, 195 P. 2d 408, 412 (1948) (Although "there is authority to the effect that the distinction formerly existing between liquidated and unliquidated demands is practically obliterated, . . . further reading . . . discloses, with citation of many cases, that the general rule is almost uniformly adhered to, namely, that interest is not allowable where the damages depend upon no fixed standard and cannot be made certain except by accord, verdict or decree"); D. Dobbs, Remedies &#167; 3.5, p. 165 (1973) ("Most courts, in the absence of a statute to the contrary, would not award interest on unliquidated pecuniary claims, the amount of which could not be ascertained or computed, even in theory, without a trial"); see generally C. McCormick, Law of Damages &#167; 51, p. 210 (1935) (explaining evolution of rule in America); see also 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies &#167; 3.6(1), p. 336 (2d ed. 1993) ("The most significant limitation on the recovery of prejudgment interest is the general rule that, apart from statute, prejudgment interest is not recoverable on claims that are neither liquidated as a dollar sum nor ascertainable by fixed standards" (footnotes omitted)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awards of such interest on claims for unliquidated and unascertainable damages for breach of a contract appear to have been rarer still. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Williams&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Idaho Potato Starch Co.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/idaho/7YM6/williams-v-idaho-potato-starch-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;73&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Idaho&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 24, 245 P. 2d 1045, 1051-1052 (1952); &lt;i&gt;Meyer&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Strom,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/wash/6QdT/meyer-v-strom/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;37&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wash. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;818&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 829-830, 226 P. 2d 218, 224 (1951); &lt;i&gt;Lineman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Schmid, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 207-213, 195 P. 2d, at &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*23&lt;/span&gt; 410-413; see also 3 Williston on Contracts &#167; 1413, p. 2508 (1920) ("Interest is not generally allowed . . . where market rates or prices furnish no definite or exact test of the amount due" (footnote omitted)); 1 T. Sedgwick, Measure of Damages &#167; 312, p. 614 (9th ed. 1912) ("Generally speaking, no interest can be recovered for breach of a contract, where the damages are in their nature unliquidated, until the amount is ascertained" (footnote omitted)). In fact, at the time, they were not allowed in either Colorado or Kansas. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Clark&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;Giacomini,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;85&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Colo.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;530&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 536-537, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;277&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;P.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;306&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 308 (1929); &lt;i&gt;Denver Horse Imp. Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Schafer,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;58&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Colo.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;376&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 390, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;147&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;P.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;367&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 372 (1915); &lt;i&gt;Roe&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Snattinger,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;91&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Kan.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;567&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 568, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;138&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;P.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;581&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 582 (1914); &lt;i&gt;Evans&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Moseley,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;84&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Kan.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;322&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 332-333, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;114&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;P.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;374&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 378 (1911).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and most important to this case, an award of prejudgment interest on unliquidated and unascertainable damages for breach of an interstate compact was unheard of at the time of the Compact's negotiation and approval. Unlike cases involving bonds or other instruments of credit, see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Virginia&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;West Virginia, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 232-236; &lt;i&gt;South Dakota&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;North Carolina,&lt;/i&gt; 192 U. S. 286, 317-321 (1904), monetary damages in cases of this sort, involving the apportionment of water between States, are notoriously difficult to ascertain. Indeed, despite 15 years of litigation over the Compact, and resort to a great deal of data, expert testimony, complicated methodologies, and sophisticated analyses on the subject, the final value of Kansas' damages still has yet to be determined. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 9, n. 2; see also Third Report &#167;&#167; III to X (detailing and analyzing the numerous variables and data elements necessary to arrive at a determination of Kansas' damages). It thus is not surprising that, until 1987, we had never even suggested that monetary damages could be recovered from a State as a remedy for its violation of an interstate compact apportioning the flow of an interstate stream. And when we first allowed such damages in &lt;i&gt;Texas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New Mexico,&lt;/i&gt; 482 U. S. 124 (1987), we &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*24&lt;/span&gt; did so partially at the behest of New Mexico, the breaching State. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 129-132. How, then, can one say that, at the time the Compact was negotiated and approved, its signatories could fairly be said to have intended, or at least could reasonably be said to have expected or assumed, that Kansas might recover prejudgment interest on damages caused by Colorado's breach? The necessary predicate to such a recovery was neither recognized nor even contemplated by this Court or, apparently, by the state parties to original actions of this sort, until some 40 years thence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of this history, it seems inescapable that any participant in the drafting and negotiation of the Compact would, if asked at the time, have reacted with marked surprise to the notion that the Compact rendered its signatories liable for an award of prejudgment interest such as that sanctioned by the Court today. As both the Compact itself and the parties' post-Compact course of dealing make clear, the "fair intendment" of the Compact very probably was simply for the in-kind recovery of water as a remedy for its breach. The Compact says nothing about the availability of prejudgment interest on money damages as part of any remedy or, for that matter, about the availability of money damages as a remedy in the first instance. It contemplates the delivery of water from Colorado to Kansas, pure and simple. See Arkansas River Compact, reprinted in App. to Brief for Kansas A-1. When Kansas filed its complaint in this matter, "it sought only a decree commanding Colorado `to deliver the waters of the Arkansas River in accordance with the provisions of the Arkansas River Compact.' " Third Report &#167; XI, at 98. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Colorado&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Kansas,&lt;/i&gt; 320 U. S. 383, 391 (1943) (discussing Kansas' prayer for relief in the form of "an apportionment in second feet or acre feet"). Not until our decision in &lt;i&gt;Texas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New Mexico, supra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; did Kansas amend its complaint to include a claim for monetary damages. See Third Report &#167; XI, at 98. Neither Kansas nor Colorado appears ever to have anticipated or assumed, much &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*25&lt;/span&gt; less expected, that the Compact might result in a monetary award of prejudgment interest over half a century after its signing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court ignores all of this in awarding prejudgment interest to Kansas, seizing instead upon the compensatory rationale behind the criticism of the common law rule and awards of prejudgment interest on unliquidated claims for damages in general. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 10-11. I do not dispute that awards of interest are compensatory in nature or that, as a general matter, "a monetary award does not fully compensate for an injury unless it includes an interest component." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 10; see also &lt;i&gt;National Gypsum Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 515 U. S., at 195, n. 7. But, as the Court itself recognizes, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 11, our precedents make clear that, at least today and in the absence of a governing statute, awards of prejudgment interest on unliquidated claims for damages are governed not by any "rigid theory of compensation for money withheld," but rather by "considerations of fairness." &lt;i&gt;Blau,&lt;/i&gt;  368 U. S., at 414 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;General Motors Corp.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Devex Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 461 U. S. 648, 651-653, and n. 5 (1983); &lt;i&gt;Funkhouser,&lt;/i&gt; 290 U. S., at 168-169. This is especially so where, as here, we are dealing with suits by one governmental body against another. See &lt;i&gt;West Virginia&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 479 U. S. 305, 309-312 (1987); &lt;i&gt;Board of Comm'rs of Jackson Cty.,&lt;/i&gt; 308 U. S., at 349-353.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing fair about awarding prejudgment interest as a remedy for the Compact's breach when all available evidence suggests that the signatories to the Compact neither intended nor contemplated such an unconventional remedy. Many compacts between States are old; suits involving compacts concerning water rights are late in starting and are invariably long pending; and, because statutes of limitation or the doctrine of laches is rarely available to preclude the steady buildup of prejudgment interest, the amount of such interest can become quite large, as Kansas' claim for approximately $41 million illustrates. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 9, n. 2. One &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*26&lt;/span&gt; would think that, particularly in such circumstances, even the most rudimentary conception of fairness would dictate that the Court ought not to interpret a contract between two States as exposing one of them to liability under a novel legal principle some 50 years later without some indication that the States might have contemplated such exposure in conjunction with the contractual rights and duties expressed in their compact. Contrary to the Court's apparent belief, see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 11-12, n. 4, nothing about such a contextualized historical approach would create an across-the-board incentive for the continued breach of interstate compacts entered into before 1987, especially given the prospect of large and uncertain damages awards. Had Kansas and Colorado anticipated or even suspected what the Court today effects, they almost certainly would have negotiated a provision in the Compact to address the situation. States in the future very likely will do so in the wake of the Court's decision, which creates a very different backdrop from the one against which Kansas and Colorado operated. In the absence of such a provision, however, "the loss [as to interest] should remain where it has fallen." &lt;i&gt;Board of Comm'rs of Jackson Cty., supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 353; see Third Report &#167; XI, at 101 ("Prejudgment interest here neither takes from those who benefitted, nor goes to those who were injured").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the Court's award of prejudgment interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  That Amendment provides: "The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Though final damages have not yet been calculated, the importance of this issue is illustrated by breaking down the damages claimed by Kansas. Of $62,369,173 in damages so claimed, $9,218,305 represents direct and indirect losses in actual dollars when the damage occurred. Of the remaining $53,150,868, about $12 million constitutes an adjustment for inflation (a type of interest that Colorado concedes is appropriate) while the remaining amount (approximately $41 million) represents additional interest intended to compensate for lost investment opportunities. Third Report of Special Master 87-88 (hereinafter Third Report). The magnitude of prejudgment interest ultimately awarded in this case will, of course, turn on the date from which interest accrues. See Part III&#151;B, &lt;i&gt;infra.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

McCormick, Law of Damages &#167; 51, p. 210 (1935); 1 T. Sedgwick, Measure of Damages &#167; 315 (9th ed. 1912); cf. 3 S. Williston, Law of Contracts &#167; 1413, p. 2508 (1920) ("The disinclination to allow interest on claim of uncertain amount seems based on practice rather than theoretical grounds"). For a thorough modern treatment of the issue, see 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies &#167; 3.6(3) (2d ed. 1993).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Justice O'Connor argues that the state of the law was insufficiently evolved by 1949 for Colorado to have had notice that the courts might award prejudgment interest if it violated its obligations under the Compact. See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 21-25 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Though the law was indeed in flux at that time, this Court had already made it clear that it put no stock in the traditional common-law prohibition, see &lt;i&gt;Funkhouser&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;J. B. Preston Co.,&lt;/i&gt; 290 U. S. 163, 168 (1933), and had stated explicitly that such interest may accrue when "considerations of fairness" demand it, see &lt;i&gt;Board of Comm'rs of Jackson Cty.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 308 U. S. 343, 352 (1939). The contemporary Restatement of Contracts was in accord. See Restatement of Contracts &#167; 337(b), at 542 ("Where the contract that is broken [is not for a set or easily ascertainable amount of money], interest may be allowed in the discretion of the court, if justice requires it, on the amount that would have been just compensation if it had been paid when performance was due"). Under those circumstances, we think it is clear that, in 1949, an informed contracting party would not have concluded that an agreement's silence on the issue deprived a reviewing court of the authority to award compensatory interest if the party willfully violated its contractual obligations. Moreover, under Justice O'Connor's reasoning, States who entered into interstate compacts before 1987, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 23, would retain a perpetual incentive to breach their contractual obligations and reap the benefits of such a breach with the full knowledge that the courts lack the authority to order a fully compensatory remedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  Justice O'Connor, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas would not allow any prejudgment interest. See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 20. Justice Kennedy and The Chief Justice are of the opinion that prejudgment interest should run from the date of the filing of the complaint. Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and the author of this opinion agree with the Special Master's view that interest should run from the time when Colorado knew or should have known that it was violating the Compact. In order to produce a majority for a judgment, the four Justices who agree with the Special Master have voted to endorse the position expressed in the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  As the Special Master noted, "Colorado experts did not dispute, in general, the linear relationship between [water usage] and crop yield. . . . However, they were of the view that the particular linear crop yield coefficients used by Kansas were not sufficiently reliable to determine the increase in yields that would have occurred if there had been no depletions of headgate deliveries to the [affected] lands." Third Report 47. Colorado suggests that Kansas' model, based as it is upon academic studies, does not adequately account for reductions in crop yield from such realworld conditions as "weather, disease, and pests." Brief for Colorado 44, n. 12. But, as the Special Master correctly noted, Kansas' experts reduced the predicted crop yield by 25% in order to account for such possibilities. Third Report 51 ("The 25% reduction was calculated to adjust the controlled experimental data to `realistic long-term type conditions' in western Kansas, including high temperatures, winds, insects, and other stressful conditions").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  Professor Whittlesey served for 20 years as a full professor and agricultural economist at Washington State University. His publications, many of which concern the kind of issues presented by this case, fill 14 pages on his curriculum vitae. See Kan. Exh. 891.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  We also agree with the Special Master's decision to disregard the Colorado expert's comparison of the numbers produced by Kansas' model with numbers drawn from the literature on the various crops planted on the affected farmland. As Colorado admits, see Brief for Colorado 46, the water values in the literature were not based on "a `short-short run' situation, that is,an intra-seasonal transaction in which no capital costs were involved, and only additional harvesting and irrigation costs would be required." Third Report 63. Because the circumstances in Kansas involved short-short run situations, and because such short-short run situations generally involve higher values for water, values derived from other contexts are of limited use in evaluating Kansas' model. See &lt;i&gt;ibid.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="docket"&gt;No. 00-492.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="court"&gt;SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="date"&gt;Argued April 17, 2001&lt;br&gt;Decided June 11, 2001&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="prelims"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Syllabus&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Interstate Agreement on Detainers (Agreement) creates uniform procedures for lodging and executing a detainer, i.e., a legal order that requires a State to hold a currently imprisoned individual when he has finished serving his sentence so that he may be tried by a different State for a different crime. As relevant here, the Agreement provides that a State that obtains a prisoner for purposes of trial must try him within 120 days of his arrival, Art. IV(c), and if it returns him to his "original place of imprisonment" prior to that trial, charges "shall" be dismissed with prejudice, Art. IV(e). While respondent Bozeman was serving a federal prison sentence in Florida, the Covington County, Alabama, district attorney sought temporary custody of Bozeman to arraign him on firearms charges and to appoint counsel. When taken to Covington County, Bozeman spent the night in the county jail, appeared in local court the next morning, obtained local counsel, and was returned to federal prison that evening. About one month later, he was brought back to the county for trial. Bozeman's counsel moved to dismiss the state charges on the ground that, because Bozeman had been "returned to the original place of imprisonment" (namely, the federal prison) "prior to" "trial" on state charges being "had," in violation of Article IV(e), the local court had to dismiss the charges with prejudice in light of Art. IV(e)'s command as to remedy. Bozeman was convicted, and an appeals court affirmed. The State Supreme Court reversed, holding that the Agreement's literal language controlled and required dismissal of the state charges.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Held: The literal language of Article IV(e) bars any further criminal proceedings when a defendant is returned to the original place of imprisonment before trial. Pp. 5-10.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(a) Alabama claims that Article IV(e)'s basic purpose is to prevent shuttling that would interrupt a prisoner's rehabilitation and that, since the one-day interruption here did not interrupt rehabilitation significantly any violation is "technical," "harmless," or "de minimus." However, the Agreement's language militates against an implicit exception, for it is absolute, as the word "shall" is ordinarily the language of command. Anderson v. Yungkau, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x2f/anderson-v-yungkau/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;329&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;482&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 485. Moreover, the Agreement makes no distinction among different kinds of arrivals, e.g., exempting those that are followed by return within a short, specified time period, or those that are simply for arraignment purposes. Pp. 5-7.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(b) Even assuming that the Agreement exempts violations that, viewed in terms of its purposes, are de minimus, the violation here could not qualify as trivial, because the "no return" provision's purpose cannot be a simple, direct effort to prevent the interruption of rehabilitation. Article IV(e)'s requirement that the prisoner remain in the county jail means that he will typically spend 120 days away from the sending State's rehabilitation programs, whereas returning him prior to trial-in violation of IV(e)-would permit him to participate in the sending State's program for some of those days. To call such a violation "technical," because it means fewer days spent away from the sending State, is to call virtually every conceivable antishuttling violation "technical." The Agreement may seek to remove rehabilitation obstructions in a different way: Requiring the receiving State to pay for the prisoner's incarceration during the pretrial period (pursuant to Article V) may give the State an incentive to shorten that period and dispose of detainers expeditiously. Alternatively, the Agreement's drafters may have sought to minimize the number of shuttles in the belief that the "shuttling" itself adds to the uncertainties obstructing rehabilitation programs, see Art. I. Regardless of the antishuttling remedy's original purpose, given the Agreement's absolute language, it is enough to explain why Alabama's view is not plausible and to point to other purposes more easily squared with Article IV(e)'s text and operation. Pp. 7-9.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(c) Alabama's additional claim that return to the sending State after a brief journey to the receiving State for pretrial purposes is helpful, not harmful, to the prisoner is a policy argument more appropriately addressed to legislatures. And the federal statutory provision to which the Solicitor General points governs only when the United States is a receiving State, which does not help Alabama's cause. Although this Court rejects Alabama's interpretation of the Agreement, a receiving State is not barred from returning a prisoner when it would be mutually advantageous and the prisoner accordingly waives his Article IV(e) rights. Pp. 9-10.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ALABAMA&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Breyer, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, Parts I, II-A, and II-C of which were unanimous, and Part II-B of which was joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Stevens, O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Opinion of the Court&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn-s" id="fn-s_ref"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p1"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Forty-eight States, the Federal Government, and the District of Columbia (all of which, for simplicity, we shall call "States") have entered into the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (Agreement), 18 U.S.C. App. 2, p. 692, an interstate compact. The Agreement creates uniform procedures for lodging and executing a detainer, i.e., a legal order that requires a State in which an individual is currently imprisoned to hold that individual when he has finished serving his sentence so that he may be tried by a different State for a different crime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p2"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Agreement provides for expeditious delivery of the prisoner to the receiving State for trial prior to the termination of his sentence in the sending State. And it seeks to minimize the consequent interruption of the prisoner's ongoing prison term. In particular, Article IV(c) specifies that the receiving State shall begin the prisoner's "trial . . . within one hundred and twenty days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving State." At the same time, Article IV(e) prohibits return of the individual to the sending State before that trial is complete. It says:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p3"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"If trial is not had on any indictment, information, or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner's being returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to article V(e) hereof, such indictment, information, or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice." (Emphasis added.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p4"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The case before us requires us to interpret the Article IV language that we have just quoted. See New York v. Hill, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/Bb6/new-york-v-hill/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;528&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;110&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 111 (2000) ("As 'a congressionally sanctioned interstate compact' within the Compact Clause of the United States Constitution, Art. I, 10, cl. 3, the [Interstate Agreement on Detainers] is a federal law subject to federal construction") (quoting Carchman v. Nash, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z9F/carchman-v-nash/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;473&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;716&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 719 (1985); Cuyler v. Adams, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yP6/cuyler-v-adams/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;449&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;433&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 442 (1981)). The case concerns a defendant whose initial imprisonment was interrupted briefly-for a single day-during which time he was brought to the receiving State for purposes of arraignment and then returned immediately to his original place of imprisonment. The question is whether, in such circumstances, the literal language of Article IV(e) bars any further criminal proceedings-because the defendant was "returned to the original place of imprisonment" before "trial" was "had." We conclude that Article IV(e) does bar further proceedings, despite the fact that the interruption of the initial imprisonment lasted for only one day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p5"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;* A&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p6"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Council of State Governments drafted the language of the Agreement in 1956. See United States v. Mauro, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yEg/united-states-v-mauro/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;436&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;340&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 349-350 (1978). The United States joined in 1970. Id., at 343. And Alabama is one of the 49 other current members. Hill, supra, at 111; Ala. Code 15-9-81 (1995). The Agreement contains nine articles. Article I sets forth the problems that led to the Agreement's creation, namely, that "charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations, or complaints and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation." Article I then adds that "it is the . . . purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of ... detainers ... ."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p7"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Article II sets forth definitions. Article III gives a prisoner against whom a detainer has been lodged the right to "request" a "final disposition" of the relevant charges, in which case "he shall be brought to trial within one hundred and eighty days" (unless extended by the trial court for "good cause"); otherwise, the relevant "indictment, information, or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice." Art. III(a), (d).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p8"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Article IV gives "the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment, information, or complaint is pending," i.e., the receiving State, the right "to have a prisoner against whom" it "has lodged a detainer . . . made available" for trial. Art. IV(a). It says further that, once the prisoner arrives in the receiving State, the "trial" must begin "within one hundred and twenty days" unless extended for "good cause." Art. IV(c). Article IV also sets forth the "antishuttling" provision at issue here. To repeat: that provision says that trial must be "had . . . prior to the prisoner's being returned to the original place of imprisonment"; otherwise, the charges "shall" be dismissed with prejudice. Art. IV(e). Article V sets forth conditions on the receiving State obtaining temporary custody of the prisoner. The remaining articles deal with subsidiary matters, not relevant here with one exception: Article IX provides that the "agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p9"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For present purposes, it is important to keep in mind that the Agreement basically (1) gives a prisoner the right to demand a trial within 180 days; and (2) gives a State the right to obtain a prisoner for purposes of trial, in which case the State (a) must try the prisoner within 120 days of his arrival, and (b) must not return the prisoner to his "original place of imprisonment" prior to that trial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;B&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p10"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In January 1997, respondent Michael Bozeman was serving a sentence of imprisonment for a federal drug crime in federal prison in Marianna, Florida. At the beginning of that month, the district attorney of Covington County, Alabama, who had earlier lodged a detainer against Bozeman in connection with charges related to discharging firearms, sought temporary custody in order to arraign Bozeman on those firearms charges and secure the appointment of counsel. On January 23, federal authorities released Bozeman to local officials. Those officials took him to Covington County, about 80 miles from the federal prison, where he arrived later in the day. Bozeman spent the night in the county jail, appeared in local court the next morning, obtained local appointed counsel, and was transported back to federal prison that evening. About one month later, Bozeman was brought back to Covington County for trial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p11"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At that time, Bozeman's local counsel filed a motion to dismiss the state charges on the ground that in January Bozeman had been "returned to the original place of imprisonment" (namely, the federal prison) "prior to" "trial" on state charges being "had." See App. 37-42. Consequently, he argued, under Article IV(e) the state charges were without "any further force or effect," and the local court had to "enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p12"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Bozeman was convicted, and the trial court subsequently denied Bozeman's motion for dismissal. It wrote that it "made much sense to bring" Bozeman "into the county briefly" to deal with "short pre-trial matters" and then to "return him to the surroundings to which he was accustomed." App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a. Doing so furthered Bozeman's "interest in maintaining . . . rehabilitation available to him in federal prison." Ibid. In the trial judge's view, Bozeman "certainly would not [have] receive[d] much rehabilitation in a county jail." Ibid. Consequently, the judge concluded, the January transfer was "wholly consistent with" the Agreement's goal, "to expedite the prosecution of state charges without interfering with any rehabilitative programs of the federal government." Id., at 29a.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p13"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;An intermediate State Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;738&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;So. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;934&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1998). But the Alabama State Supreme Court reversed by a 4-to-3 vote. &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ala/9LU5/ex-parte-bozeman/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;781&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;So. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;165&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (2000). In its view, the literal language of the Agreement controlled and required dismissal of the state charges. The dissenters argued that the Agreement violation was merely "technical," and consequently did not require dismissal. Id., at 170. The State petitioned for certiorari. In light of differences among the lower courts, we granted the writ. Compare, e.g., United States v. Schrum, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca10/2YJw/united-states-v-albert-w-schrum-united-states-of-a/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;638&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;214&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 215 (CA10 1981) (per curiam) (adopting District Court's literal interpretation of Agreement), with United States v. Daniels, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca1/ZWh/united-states-v-daniels/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 27-28 (CA1 1993) (rejecting literal interpretation of Agreement). And we now affirm the Alabama Supreme Court's decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;II&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p14"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Alabama does not deny a violation of Article IV(e) as literally interpreted, for it concedes that its officials "returned" Bozeman to his "original place of imprisonment," before Bozeman's county court "trial" was "had." Nor does Alabama claim that Bozeman waived the right to trial before return that Article IV provides. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 1, n. 1. Cf. Hill, 528 U.S., at 114-115 (holding that defendant may waive his rights under Art. III of the Agreement). Rather, Alabama, supported by the United States Solicitor General and others, claims that Article IV(e)'s basic purpose is to prevent shuttling that would interrupt the prisoner's rehabilitation. See, e.g., United States v. Roy, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca7/3xdR/united-states-v-michael-roy/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;830&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;628&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 636 (CA7 1987) (provision is "meant to protect the prisoner against endless interruption of the rehabilitation programs because of criminal proceedings in other jurisdictions"). They say the one-day interruption that occurred here did not interrupt rehabilitation significantly. Hence, any violation is "technical," "harmless," or "de minimis." And Article IV(e) contains an implicit exception for such trivial violations. Brief for Petitioner 26; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12-13. Cf. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue v. William Wrigley, Jr., Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zwi/wisconsin-dept-of-revenue-v-william-wrigley-jr-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;505&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;214&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 231 (1992) (laws ordinarily are enacted with understanding that de minimis exceptions will be recognized). We cannot accept this argument, however, for two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p15"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;* First, the language of the Agreement militates against an implicit exception, for it is absolute. It says that, when a prisoner is "returned" before trial, the indictment, information, or complaint "shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice." Art. IV(e) (emphasis added). "The word 'shall' is ordinarily 'the language of command.' " Anderson v. Yungkau, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x2f/anderson-v-yungkau/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;329&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;482&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 485 (1947) (quoting Escoe v. Zerbst, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wsM/escoe-v-zerbst/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;295&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;490&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 493 (1935)).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p16"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The cases Alabama cites as supporting a "harmless error" construction involved statutes that lacked this absolute language. See, e.g., United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zqC/united-states-v-montalvo-murillo/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;495&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;711&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 716-717 (1990) (Bail Reform Act "is silent on the issue of a remedy for violations of its time limits"). Cf. William Wrigley, Jr., supra, at 231-232 (applying "de minimis exception" presumption as "part of the established background of legal principles against which all enactments are adopted," where text did not provide a "contrary indication").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p17"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Agreement makes no distinction among different kinds of IV(c) "arrivals," say, by exempting those that are followed by return within a short, specified period of time, or those that are simply for the purpose of arraignment. Given the Agreement's language and the important consequences of starting the running of the 120-day time limit, we see no basis for such a distinction. Hence, we must assume that every prisoner arrival in the receiving State, whether followed by a very brief stay or a very long stay in the receiving State, triggers IV(e)'s "no return" requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;B&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p18"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Second, even were we to assume for argument's sake that the Agreement exempts violations that, viewed in terms of the Agreement's purposes, are de minimis, cf. Article IX (stating that Agreement "shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes"), we could not say that the violation at issue here qualifies as trivial. That is because the purpose of the "no return" provision cannot be as Alabama and the Solicitor General describe it, namely, as a simple, direct effort to prevent the interruption of rehabilitation. A provision that prevents returning a prisoner who has arrived in the receiving State does not directly increase the number of days the prisoner will spend in rehabilitation in the sending State. Rather, it directly and intentionally decreases the number of days that prisoner will spend in the sending State.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p19"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This point is obvious once one keeps in mind that the trial must take place within 120 days of the prisoner's arrival in the receiving State. Article IV(e)'s requirement that the prisoner remain in the county jail means that the prisoner will spend all of those 120 days away from the sending State's rehabilitation programs. By contrast, returning the prisoner prior to trial-in violation of Article IV(e)-would permit the prisoner to participate in the sending State's program for some of those days. But to call such a violation "technical," because it means fewer days spent away from the sending State, is to call virtually every conceivable antishuttling violation "technical"-a circumstance which, like the 13th chime of the clock, shows that Alabama's conception of the provision's purpose is seriously flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p20"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Article IV(e) may seek to remove obstructions to prisoner rehabilitation in a different way. The Agreement not only prevents "return," but it also requires the receiving State to pay for the prisoner's incarceration in that State during the period prior to trial. Art. V(h) ("From the time that a party State receives custody of a prisoner pursuant to this agreement until such prisoner is returned to the territory and custody of the sending State, the [receiving] State ... shall be responsible for the prisoner and shall also pay all costs of transporting, caring for, keeping, and returning the prisoner"). That requirement may provide the receiving State with an incentive to shorten the pretrial period-to proceed to trial faster than 120 days or not to seek extensions-thus disposing of detainers, and the attendant "uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation," in the most "expeditious" manner. Art. I. See also Cuyler, 449 U.S., at 449 (discussing negative effects of detainers on prisoners). But if that is Article IV(e)'s purpose, the transfer here was inconsistent with it. By returning Bozeman to federal prison, the county saved itself the cost of housing him- and for a nontrivial several week period, which may have allowed it to delay resolving the detainer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p21"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the Agreement's drafters may have thought that the "shuttling" itself, i.e., the movement back and forth among prisons, adds to the "uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation." Art. I (emphasis added). And they may have sought to minimize the number of "shuttles" for that reason alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p22"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Viewing the Agreement in terms of either purpose, we cannot say that the one-day violation here is de mimimis, technical, or harmless. Neither do the briefs (or, to our knowledge, any lower court opinion) point to any other plausible rehabilitation-related purpose of Article IV(e) specifically, in terms of which the violation here might count as trivial. But we need not decide precisely what led Congress and the many other legislatures to agree to Article IV(e)'s antishuttling remedy. Given the Agreement's absolute language, it is enough to explain why Alabama's view of the Agreement's purpose is not plausible and to point to other purposes more easily squared with Article IV(e)'s text and operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p23"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Alabama and amici make additional claims, basically elaborating on the trial court's view that return to the sending State after a brief journey to the receiving State for pretrial purposes is helpful, not harmful, to the prisoner. But given Article IV's text, which indicates a contrary view, the parties would more appropriately address these policy arguments to legislatures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p24"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Solicitor General also points to a federal statutory provision that says expressly that an "order of a court dismissing any indictment, information, or complaint may be with or without prejudice," depending on the "seriousness of the offense," the "facts and circumstances of the case," and the "impact of a reprosecution on the administration of the agreement" and "on the administration of justice." 18 U.S.C. App. 9(1), p. 695. This statutory provision, however, governs only when "the United States is a receiving State." 9. And here the United States is not the receiving State. We fail to see how this provision helps, rather than hurts, Alabama's cause. Although we reject Alabama's interpretation of the Agreement, our decision does not bar a receiving State from returning a prisoner when it would be mutually advantageous and the prisoner accordingly waives his rights under Article IV(e). Cf. Hill, 528 U.S., at 114-115 (holding that defendant may waive his rights under Art. III of the Agreement)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p25"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For these reasons, the judgment of the Alabama Supreme Court is affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p26"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="docket"&gt;No. 00-549.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="date"&gt;Argued April 18, 2001&lt;br&gt;Decided June 11, 2001&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="prelims"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Syllabus&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Petitioner, a corporate promoter of boxing matches, sued Don King, the president and sole shareholder of a rival corporation, alleging that King had conducted his corporation's affairs in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which makes it "unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise ... to conduct or participate ... in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity," 18 U.S.C.  1962(c). The District Court, citing Circuit precedent, dismissed the complaint. In affirming, the Second Circuit expressed its view that 1962(c) applies only where a plaintiff shows the existence of two separate entities, a "person" and a distinct "enterprise," the affairs of which that "person" improperly conducts. In this instance, the court noted, it was undisputed that King was an employee of his corporation and also acting within the scope of his authority. Under the court's analysis, King, in a legal sense, was part of the corporation, not a "person," distinct from the "enterprise," who allegedly improperly conducted the "enterprise's affairs."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Held: In the circumstances of this case, 1962(c) requires no more than the formal legal distinction between "person" and "enterprise" (namely, incorporation); hence, the provision applies when a corporate employee unlawfully conducts the affairs of the corporation of which he is the sole owner-whether he conducts those affairs within the scope, or beyond the scope, of corporate authority. This Court does not quarrel with the basic principle that to establish liability under 1962(c) one must allege and prove the existence of two distinct entities: (1) a "person"; and (2) an "enterprise" that is not simply the same "person" referred to by a different name. Nonetheless, the Court disagrees with the appellate court's application of that "distinctness" principle to the present circumstances, in which a corporate employee, acting within the scope of his authority, allegedly conducts the corporation's affairs in a RICO-forbidden way. The corporate owner/employee, a natural person, is distinct from the corporation itself, a legally different entity with different rights and responsibilities due to its different legal status. The Court can find nothing in RICO that requires more "separateness" than that. Linguistically speaking, an employee who conducts his corporation's affairs through illegal acts comes within 1962(c)'s terms forbidding any "person" unlawfully to conduct an "enterprise," particularly when RICO explicitly defines "person" to include "any individual ... capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property," and defines "enterprise" to include a "corporation," 1961(3), (4). And, linguistically speaking, the employee and the corporation are different "persons," even where the employee is the corporation's sole owner. Incorporation's basic purpose is to create a legal entity distinct from those natural individuals who created the corporation, who own it, or whom it employs. See, e.g., United States v. Bestfoods, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B9g/united-states-v-bestfoods/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;524&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;51&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 61-62. The precedent on which the Second Circuit relied involved significantly different circumstances from those here at issue. Further, to apply RICO in these circumstances is consistent with the statute's basic purposes of protecting both a legitimate "enterprise" from those who would use unlawful acts to victimize it, United States v. Turkette, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yRF/united-states-v-turkette/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;452&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;576&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 591, and the public from those who would unlawfully use an "enterprise" (whether legitimate or illegitimate) as a "vehicle" through which unlawful activity is committed, National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zyX/national-organization-for-women-inc-et-al-v/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;510&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;249&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 259. Conversely, the appellate court's critical legal distinction-between employees acting within and without the scope of corporate authority-would immunize from RICO liability many of those at whom this Court has said RICO directly aims, e.g., high-ranking individuals in an illegitimate criminal enterprise, who, seeking to further the enterprise's purposes, act within the scope of their authority, cf. Turkette, supra, at 581. Finally, nothing in the statute's history significantly favors an alternative interpretation. This Court's rule is no less consistent than is the lower court's rule with the following principles cited by King: (1) the principle that a corporation acts only through its directors, officers, and agents; (2) the principle that a corporation should not be liable for its employees' criminal acts where Congress so intends; and (3) antitrust law's intracorporate conspiracy doctrine. Pp. 2-8.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Breyer, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Opinion of the Court&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C.  1961 et seq., makes it "unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise ... to conduct or participate ... in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs" through the commission of two or more statutorily defined crimes-which RICO calls "a pattern of racketeering activity." 1962(c). The language suggests, and lower courts have held, that this provision fore- sees two separate entities, a "person" and a distinct "enterprise."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p2"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This case focuses upon a person who is the president and sole shareholder of a closely held corporation. The plaintiff claims that the president has conducted the corporation's affairs through the forbidden "pattern," though for present purposes it is conceded that, in doing so, he acted within the scope of his authority as the corporation's employee. In these circumstances, are there two entities, a "person" and a separate "enterprise"? Assuming, as we must given the posture of this case, that the allegations in the complaint are true, we conclude that the "person" and "enterprise" here are distinct and that the RICO provision applies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Petitioner, Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd., is a corporation that promotes boxing matches. Petitioner sued Don King, the president and sole shareholder of Don King Productions, a corporation, claiming that King had conducted the boxing-related affairs of Don King Productions in part through a RICO "pattern," i.e., through the alleged commission of at least two instances of fraud and other RICO predicate crimes. The District Court, citing Court of Appeals precedent, dismissed the complaint. Civ. No. 98-6859, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;1999&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;WL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;771366&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, *3-4 (SDNY, Sept. 28, 1999). And the Court of Appeals affirmed that dismissal. &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca2/4WKd/cedric-kushner-promotions-ltd-v-don-king-don-king-/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;219&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;115&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CA2 2000) (per curiam). In the appellate court's view, 1962(c) applies only where a plaintiff shows the existence of two separate entities, a "person" and a distinct "enterprise," the affairs of which that "person" improperly conducts. Id., at 116. In this instance, "it is undisputed that King was an employee" of the corporation Don King Productions and also "acting within the scope of his authority." Id., at 117. Under the Court of Appeals' analysis, King, in a legal sense, was part of, not separate from, the corporation. There was no "person," distinct from the "enterprise," who improperly conducted the "enterprise's affairs." And thus 1962(c) did not apply. Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Other Circuits, applying 1962(c) in roughly similar circumstances, have reached a contrary conclusion. See, e.g., Brannon v. Boatmen's First Nat.

    &lt;div class="num" id="p5"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We do not quarrel with the basic principle that to establish liability under 1962(c) one must allege and prove the existence of two distinct entities: (1) a "person"; and (2) an "enterprise" that is not simply the same "person" referred to by a different name. The statute's language, read as ordinary English, suggests that principle. The Act says that it applies to "person[s]" who are "employed by or associated with" the "enterprise." 1962(c). In ordinary English one speaks of employing, being employed by, or associating with others, not oneself. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 132 (1993) (defining "associate"); id., at 743 (defining "employ"). In addition, the Act's purposes are consistent with that principle. Whether the Act seeks to prevent a person from victimizing, say, a small business, S. Rep. No. 91-617, p. 77 (1969), or to prevent a person from using a corporation for criminal purposes, National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zyX/national-organization-for-women-inc-et-al-v/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;510&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;249&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 259 (1994), the person and the victim, or the person and the tool, are different entities, not the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p6"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Acting Solicitor General reads 1962(c) "to require some distinctness between the RICO defendant and the RICO enterprise." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 11. And she says that this requirement is "legally sound and workable." Ibid. We agree with her assessment, particularly in light of the fact that 12 Courts of Appeals have interpreted the statute as embodying some such distinctness requirement without creating discernible mischief in the administration of RICO.

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p7"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While accepting the "distinctness" principle, we nonetheless disagree with the appellate court's application of that principle to the present circumstances-circumstances in which a corporate employee, "acting within the scope of his authority," 219 F.3d, at 117, allegedly conducts the corporation's affairs in a RICO-forbidden way. The corporate owner/employee, a natural person, is distinct from the corporation itself, a legally different entity with different rights and responsibilities due to its different legal status. And we can find nothing in the statute that requires more "separateness" than that. Cf. McCullough v. Suter, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca7/3iz3/rd-mccullough-ii-and-utica-national-bank-as-truste/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;757&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;142&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 144 (CA7 1985) (finding either formal or practical separateness sufficient to be distinct under 1962(c)).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p8"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Linguistically speaking, an employee who conducts the affairs of a corporation through illegal acts comes within the terms of a statute that forbids any "person" unlawfully to conduct an "enterprise," particularly when the statute explicitly defines "person" to include "any individual ... capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property," and defines "enterprise" to include a "corporation." 18 U.S.C.  1961(3), (4). And, linguistically speaking, the employee and the corporation are different "persons," even where the employee is the corporation's sole owner. After all, incorporation's basic purpose is to create a distinct legal entity, with legal rights, obligations, powers, and privileges different from those of the natural individuals who created it, who own it, or whom it employs. See United States v. Bestfoods, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B9g/united-states-v-bestfoods/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;524&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;51&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 61-62 (1998); Burnet v. Clark, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wjv/burnet-v-clark/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;287&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;410&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 415 (1932); 1 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations 7, 14 (rev. ed. 1999).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p9"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We note that the Second Circuit relied on earlier Circuit precedent for its decision. But that precedent involved quite different circumstances which are not presented here. This case concerns a claim that a corporate employee is the "person" and the corporation is the "enterprise." It is natural to speak of a corporate employee as a "person employed by" the corporation. 1962(c). The earlier Second Circuit precedent concerned a claim that a corporation was the "person" and the corporation, together with all its employees and agents, were the "enterprise." See Riverwoods Chappaqua Corp. v. Marine Midland Bank, N. A., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca2/4sFF/riverwoods-chappaqua-corp-and-harvey-shapiro-v-mar/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;339&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 344 (1994) (affirming dismissal of complaint). It is less natural to speak of a corporation as "employed by" or "associated with" this latter oddly constructed entity. And the Second Circuit's other precedent also involved significantly different allegations compared with the instant case. See Anatian v. Coutts Bank (Switzerland) Ltd., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca2/4VP2/rachamin-anatian-atik-llc-charles-gundy-llc-chesed/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;193&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;85&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 89 (1999) (affirming dismissal where plaintiff alleged that same bank was both "person" and "enterprise"), cert. denied, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;528&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1188&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (2000); Discon, Inc. v. NYNEX Corp., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca2/4Hw1/discon-incorporated-v-nynex-corporation-nynex-mate/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;93&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1055&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 1064 (1996) (involving complaint alleging that corporate subsidiaries were "persons" and subsidiaries, taken together as parent, were "enterprise"), vacated on other grounds, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B9Q/nynex-corp-v-discon-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;525&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1998); Bennett, supra, at 315, and n. 2 (same as Anatian). We do not here consider the merits of these cases, and note only their distinction from the instant case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p10"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Further, to apply the RICO statute in present circumstances is consistent with the statute's basic purposes as this Court has defined them. The Court has held that RICO both protects a legitimate "enterprise" from those who would use unlawful acts to victimize it, United States v. Turkette, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yRF/united-states-v-turkette/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;452&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;576&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 591 (1981), and also protects the public from those who would unlawfully use an "enterprise" (whether legitimate or illegitimate) as a "vehicle" through which "unlawful ... activity is committed," National Organization for Women, Inc., 510 U.S., at 259. A corporate employee who conducts the corporation's affairs through an unlawful RICO "pattern . . . of activity," 1962(c), uses that corporation as a "vehicle" whether he is, or is not, its sole owner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p11"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Conversely, the appellate court's critical legal distinction-between employees acting within the scope of corporate authority and those acting outside that authority-is inconsistent with a basic statutory purpose. Cf. Reves, supra, at 184 (stating that an enterprise is " 'operated,' " within 1962(c)'s meaning, "not just by upper management but also by lower rung participants in the enterprise who are under the direction of upper management" (emphasis added)). It would immunize from RICO liability many of those at whom this Court has said RICO directly aims-e.g., high-ranking individuals in an illegitimate criminal enterprise, who, seeking to further the purposes of that enterprise, act within the scope of their authority. Cf. Turkette, supra, at 581 (Congress "did nothing to indicate that an enterprise consisting of a group of individuals was not covered by RICO if the purpose of the enterprise was exclusively criminal").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p12"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Finally, we have found nothing in the statute's history that significantly favors an alternative interpretation. That history not only refers frequently to the importance of undermining organized crime's influence upon legitimate businesses but also refers to the need to protect the public from those who would run "organization[s] in a manner detrimental to the public interest." S. Rep. No. 91-617, at 82. This latter purpose, as we have said, invites the legal principle we endorse, namely, that in present circumstances the statute requires no more than the formal legal distinction between "person" and "enterprise" (namely, incorporation) that is present here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p13"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In reply, King argues that the lower court's rule is consistent with (1) the principle that a corporation acts only through its directors, officers, and agents, 1 Fletcher, supra, 30, (2) the principle that a corporation should not be liable for the criminal acts of its employees where Congress so intends, Brief for Respondents 20-21, and (3) the Sherman Act principle limiting liability under 15 U.S.C.  1 by excluding "from unlawful combinations or conspiracies the activities of a single firm," Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z4y/copperweld-corp-v-independence-tube-corp/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;467&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;752&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 769-770, n. 15 (1984). The alternative that we endorse, however, is no less consistent with these principles. It does not deny that a corporation acts through its employees; it says only that the corporation and its employees are not legally identical. It does not assert that ordinary respondeat superior principles make a corporation legally liable under RICO for the criminal acts of its employees; that is a matter of congressional intent not before us. See, e.g., Gasoline Sales, Inc., 39 F.3d, at 73 (holding that corporation cannot be "vicariously liable" for 1962(c) violations committed by its vice president). Neither is it inconsistent with antitrust law's intracorporate conspiracy doctrine; that doctrine turns on specific antitrust objectives. See Copperweld Corp., supra, at 770-771. Rather, we hold simply that the need for two distinct entities is satisfied; hence, the RICO provision before us applies when a corporate employee unlawfully conducts the affairs of the corporation of which he is the sole owner-whether he conducts those affairs within the scope, or beyond the scope, of corporate authority.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p14"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For these reasons, the Court of Appeals' judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p15"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Decided June 11, 2001.&lt;/center&gt;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*28&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*29&lt;/span&gt; Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined. Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor and Kennedy, JJ., joined, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; p. 41.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kenneth Lerner,&lt;/i&gt; by appointment of the Court, 531 U. S. 955, argued the cause and filed briefs for petitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben&lt;/i&gt; argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were former &lt;i&gt;Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Robinson, Irving L. Gornstein,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Deborah Watson.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Scalia, delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case presents the question whether the use of a thermal-imaging device aimed at a private home from a public street to detect relative amounts of heat within the home constitutes a "search" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1991 Agent William Elliott of the United States Department of the Interior came to suspect that marijuana was being grown in the home belonging to petitioner Danny Kyllo, part of a triplex on Rhododendron Drive in Florence, Oregon. Indoor marijuana growth typically requires highintensity lamps. In order to determine whether an amount of heat was emanating from petitioner's home consistent with the use of such lamps, at 3:20 a.m. on January 16, 1992, Agent Elliott and Dan Haas used an Agema Thermovision 210 thermal imager to scan the triplex. Thermal imagers detect infrared radiation, which virtually all objects emit but which is not visible to the naked eye. The imager converts radiation into images based on relative warmth&#151;black &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*30&lt;/span&gt; is cool, white is hot, shades of gray connote relative differences; in that respect, it operates somewhat like a video camera showing heat images. The scan of Kyllo's home took only a few minutes and was performed from the passenger seat of Agent Elliott's vehicle across the street from the front of the house and also from the street in back of the house. The scan showed that the roof over the garage and a side wall of petitioner's home were relatively hot compared to the rest of the home and substantially warmer than neighboring homes in the triplex. Agent Elliott concluded that petitioner was using halide lights to grow marijuana in his house, which indeed he was. Based on tips from informants, utility bills, and the thermal imaging, a Federal Magistrate Judge issued a warrant authorizing a search of petitioner's home, and the agents found an indoor growing operation involving more than 100 plants. Petitioner was indicted on one count of manufacturing marijuana, in violation of 21 U. S. C. &#167; 841(a)(1). He unsuccessfully moved to suppress the evidence seized from his home and then entered a conditional guilty plea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing regarding the intrusiveness of thermal imaging. On remand the District Court found that the Agema 210 "is a non-intrusive device which emits no rays or beams and shows a crude visual image of the heat being radiated from the outside of the house"; it "did not show any people or activity within the walls of the structure"; "[t]he device used cannot penetrate walls or windows to reveal conversations or human activities"; and "[n]o intimate details of the home were observed." Supp. App. to Pet. for Cert. 39-40. Based on these findings, the District Court upheld the validity of the warrant that relied in part upon the thermal imaging, and reaffirmed its denial of the motion to suppress. A divided Court of Appeals initially reversed, 140 F. 3d 1249 (1998), but that &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*31&lt;/span&gt; opinion was withdrawn and the panel (after a change in composition) affirmed, 190 F. 3d 1041 (1999), with Judge Noonan dissenting. The court held that petitioner had shown no subjective expectation of privacy because he had made no attempt to conceal the heat escaping from his home, &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt;  at 1046, and even if he had, there was no objectively reasonable expectation of privacy because the imager "did not expose any intimate details of Kyllo's life," only "amorphous `hot spots' on the roof and exterior wall," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 1047. We granted certiorari. 530 U. S. 1305 (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fourth Amendment provides that "[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated." "At the very core" of the Fourth Amendment "stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion." &lt;i&gt;Silverman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 365 U. S. 505, 511 (1961). With few exceptions, the question whether a warrantless search of a home is reasonable and hence constitutional must be answered no. See &lt;i&gt;Illinois&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rodriguez,&lt;/i&gt; 497 U. S. 177, 181 (1990); &lt;i&gt;Payton&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York,&lt;/i&gt; 445 U. S. 573, 586 (1980).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the antecedent question whether or not a Fourth Amendment "search" has occurred is not so simple under our precedent. The permissibility of ordinary visual surveillance of a home used to be clear because, well into the 20th century, our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence was tied to common-law trespass. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g., &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Goldman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 316 U. S. 129, 134-136 (1942); &lt;i&gt;Olmstead&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 277 U. S. 438, 464-466 (1928). Cf. &lt;i&gt;Silverman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 510-512 (technical trespass not necessary for Fourth Amendment violation; it suffices if there is "actual intrusion into a constitutionally protected area"). Visual surveillance was unquestionably lawful because "`the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*32&lt;/span&gt; eye cannot by the laws of England be guilty of a trespass.' " &lt;i&gt;Boyd&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 116 U. S. 616, 628 (1886) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Entick&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Carrington,&lt;/i&gt; 19 How. St. Tr. 1029, 95 Eng. Rep. 807 (K. B. 1765)). We have since decoupled violation of a person's Fourth Amendment rights from trespassory violation of his property, see &lt;i&gt;Rakas&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Illinois,&lt;/i&gt; 439 U. S. 128, 143 (1978), but the lawfulness of warrantless visual surveillance of a home has still been preserved. As we observed in &lt;i&gt;California&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ciraolo,&lt;/i&gt; 476 U. S. 207, 213 (1986), "[t]he Fourth Amendment protection of the home has never been extended to require law enforcement officers to shield their eyes when passing by a home on public thoroughfares."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might think that the new validating rationale would be that examining the portion of a house that is in plain public view, while it is a "search"&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; despite the absence of trespass, is not an "unreasonable" one under the Fourth Amendment. See &lt;i&gt;Minnesota&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Carter,&lt;/i&gt; 525 U. S. 83, 104 (1998) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment). But in fact we have held that visual observation is no "search" at all&#151; perhaps in order to preserve somewhat more intact our doctrine that warrantless searches are presumptively unconstitutional. See &lt;i&gt;Dow Chemical Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 476 U. S. 227, 234-235, 239 (1986). In assessing when a search is not a search, we have applied somewhat in reverse the principle first enunciated in &lt;i&gt;Katz&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 389 U. S. 347 (1967). &lt;i&gt;Katz&lt;/i&gt; involved eavesdropping by means of an electronic listening device placed on the outside of a telephone booth&#151;a location not within the catalog ("persons, houses, papers, and effects") that the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches. We held that the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*33&lt;/span&gt; Fourth Amendment nonetheless protected Katz from the warrantless eavesdropping because he "justifiably relied" upon the privacy of the telephone booth. &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 353. As Justice Harlan's oft-quoted concurrence described it, a Fourth Amendment search occurs when the government violates a subjective expectation of privacy that society recognizes as reasonable. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 361. We have subsequently applied this principle to hold that a Fourth Amendment search does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; occur&#151;even when the explicitly protected location of a &lt;i&gt;house&lt;/i&gt; is concerned&#151;unless "the individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search," and "society [is] willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable." &lt;i&gt;Ciraolo, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 211. We have applied this test in holding that it is not a search for the police to use a pen register at the phone company to determine what numbers were dialed in a private home, &lt;i&gt;Smith&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maryland,&lt;/i&gt; 442 U. S. 735, 743-744 (1979), and we have applied the test on two different occasions in holding that aerial surveillance of private homes and surrounding areas does not constitute a search, &lt;i&gt;Ciraolo, supra; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Florida&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Riley,&lt;/i&gt; 488 U. S. 445 (1989).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present case involves officers on a public street engaged in more than naked-eye surveillance of a home. We have previously reserved judgment as to how much technological enhancement of ordinary perception from such a vantage point, if any, is too much. While we upheld enhanced aerial photography of an industrial complex in &lt;i&gt;Dow Chemical,&lt;/i&gt; we noted that we found "it important that this is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; an area immediately adjacent to a private home, where privacy expectations are most heightened," 476 U. S., at 237, n. 4 (emphasis in original).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be foolish to contend that the degree of privacy secured to citizens by the Fourth Amendment has been &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*34&lt;/span&gt; entirely unaffected by the advance of technology. For example, as the cases discussed above make clear, the technology enabling human flight has exposed to public view (and hence, we have said, to official observation) uncovered portions of the house and its curtilage that once were private. See &lt;i&gt;Ciraolo, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 215. The question we confront today is what limits there are upon this power of technology to shrink the realm of guaranteed privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Katz&lt;/i&gt; test&#151;whether the individual has an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable&#151;has often been criticized as circular, and hence subjective and unpredictable. See 1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure &#167; 2.1(d), pp. 393-394 (3d ed. 1996); Posner, The Uncertain Protection of Privacy by the Supreme Court, 1979 S. Ct. Rev. 173, 188; &lt;i&gt;Carter, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 97 (Scalia, J., concurring). But see &lt;i&gt;Rakas, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 143-144, n. 12. While it may be difficult to refine &lt;i&gt;Katz&lt;/i&gt; when the search of areas such as telephone booths, automobiles, or even the curtilage and uncovered portions of residences is at issue, in the case of the search of the interior of homes&#151;the prototypical and hence most commonly litigated area of protected privacy&#151; there is a ready criterion, with roots deep in the common law, of the minimal expectation of privacy that &lt;i&gt;exists,&lt;/i&gt; and that is acknowledged to be &lt;i&gt;reasonable.&lt;/i&gt; To withdraw protection of this minimum expectation would be to permit police technology to erode the privacy guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment. We think that obtaining by senseenhancing technology any information regarding the interior of the home that could not otherwise have been obtained without physical "intrusion into a constitutionally protected area," &lt;i&gt;Silverman,&lt;/i&gt; 365 U. S., at 512, constitutes a search&#151; at least where (as here) the technology in question is not in general public use. This assures preservation of that degree of privacy against government that existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted. On the basis of this criterion, the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*35&lt;/span&gt; information obtained by the thermal imager in this case was the product of a search.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government maintains, however, that the thermal imaging must be upheld because it detected "only heat radiating from the external surface of the house," Brief for United States 26. The dissent makes this its leading point, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 41, contending that there is a fundamental difference between what it calls "off-the-wall" observations and "through-the-wall surveillance." But just as a thermal imager captures only heat emanating from a house, so also a powerful directional microphone picks up only sound emanating from a house&#151;and a satellite capable of scanning from many miles away would pick up only visible light emanating from a house. We rejected such a mechanical interpretation of the Fourth Amendment in &lt;i&gt;Katz,&lt;/i&gt; where the eavesdropping device picked up only sound waves that reached the exterior of the phone booth. Reversing that approach would leave the homeowner at the mercy of advancing technology&#151; including imaging technology that could discern all human &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*36&lt;/span&gt; activity in the home. While the technology used in the present case was relatively crude, the rule we adopt must take account of more sophisticated systems that are already in use or in development.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; The dissent's reliance on the distinction between "off-the-wall" and "through-the-wall" observation is entirely incompatible with the dissent's belief, which we discuss below, that thermal-imaging observations of the intimate details of a home are impermissible. The most sophisticated thermal-imaging devices continue to measure heat "off-the-wall" rather than "through-the-wall"; the dissent's disapproval of those more sophisticated thermalimaging devices, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 49, is an acknowledgment that there is no substance to this distinction. As for the dissent's extraordinary assertion that anything learned through "an inference" cannot be a search, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 44, that would validate even the "through-the-wall" technologies that the dissent purports to disapprove. Surely the dissent does not believe that the through-the-wall radar or ultrasound technology produces an 8-by-10 Kodak glossy that needs no analysis (&lt;i&gt;i. e.,&lt;/i&gt; the making of inferences). And, of course, the novel proposition that inference insulates a search is blatantly contrary to &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Karo,&lt;/i&gt; 468 U. S. 705 (1984), where the police "inferred" from the activation of a beeper that a certain can of ether was in the home. The police activity &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*37&lt;/span&gt; was held to be a search, and the search was held unlawful.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government also contends that the thermal imaging was constitutional because it did not "detect private activities occurring in private areas," Brief for United States 22. It points out that in &lt;i&gt;Dow Chemical&lt;/i&gt; we observed that the enhanced aerial photography did not reveal any "intimate details." 476 U. S., at 238. &lt;i&gt;Dow Chemical,&lt;/i&gt; however, involved enhanced aerial photography of an industrial complex, which does not share the Fourth Amendment sanctity of the home. The Fourth Amendment's protection of the home has never been tied to measurement of the quality or quantity of information obtained. In &lt;i&gt;Silverman,&lt;/i&gt; for example, we made clear that any physical invasion of the structure of the home, "by even a fraction of an inch," was too much, 365 U. S., at 512, and there is certainly no exception to the warrant requirement for the officer who barely cracks open the front door and sees nothing but the nonintimate rug on the vestibule floor. In the home, our cases show, &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; details are intimate details, because the entire area is held safe from prying government eyes. Thus, in &lt;i&gt;Karo, supra,&lt;/i&gt; the only thing detected was a can of ether in the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*38&lt;/span&gt; home; and in &lt;i&gt;Arizona&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Hicks,&lt;/i&gt; 480 U. S. 321 (1987), the only thing detected by a physical search that went beyond what officers lawfully present could observe in "plain view" was the registration number of a phonograph turntable. These were intimate details because they were details of the home, just as was the detail of how warm&#151;or even how relatively warm&#151;Kyllo was heating his residence.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limiting the prohibition of thermal imaging to "intimate details" would not only be wrong in principle; it would be impractical in application, failing to provide "a workable accommodation between the needs of law enforcement and the interests protected by the Fourth Amendment," &lt;i&gt;Oliver&lt;/i&gt;  v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 466 U. S. 170, 181 (1984). To begin with, there is no necessary connection between the sophistication of the surveillance equipment and the "intimacy" of the details that it observes&#151;which means that one cannot say (and the police cannot be assured) that use of the relatively crude equipment at issue here will always be lawful. The Agema Thermovision 210 might disclose, for example, at what hour each night the lady of the house takes her daily sauna and bath&#151;a detail that many would consider "intimate"; and a much more sophisticated system might detect nothing more intimate than the fact that someone left a closet light on. We could not, in other words, develop a rule approving only that through-the-wall surveillance which identifies objects no smaller than 36 by 36 inches, but would have to develop a jurisprudence specifying which &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*39&lt;/span&gt; home activities are "intimate" and which are not. And even when (if ever) that jurisprudence were fully developed, no police officer would be able to know &lt;i&gt;in advance&lt;/i&gt; whether his through-the-wall surveillance picks up "intimate" details&#151; and thus would be unable to know in advance whether it is constitutional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dissent's proposed standard&#151;whether the technology offers the "functional equivalent of actual presence in the area being searched," &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 47&#151;would seem quite similar to our own at first blush. The dissent concludes that &lt;i&gt;Katz&lt;/i&gt;  was such a case, but then inexplicably asserts that if the same listening device only revealed the volume of the conversation, the surveillance would be permissible, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 49-50. Yet if, without technology, the police could not discern volume without being actually present in the phone booth, Justice Stevens should conclude a search has occurred. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Karo,&lt;/i&gt; 468 U. S., at 735 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("I find little comfort in the Court's notion that no invasion of privacy occurs until a listener obtains some significant information by use of the device. . . . A bathtub is a less private area when the plumber is present even if his back is turned"). The same should hold for the interior heat of the home if only a person present in the home could discern the heat. Thus the driving force of the dissent, despite its recitation of the above standard, appears to be a distinction among different types of information&#151;whether the "homeowner would even care if anybody noticed," &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 50. The dissent offers no practical guidance for the application of this standard, and for reasons already discussed, we believe there can be none. The people in their houses, as well as the police, deserve more precision.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*40&lt;/span&gt; We have said that the Fourth Amendment draws "a firm line at the entrance to the house," &lt;i&gt;Payton,&lt;/i&gt; 445 U. S., at 590. That line, we think, must be not only firm but also bright&#151; which requires clear specification of those methods of surveillance that require a warrant. While it is certainly possible to conclude from the videotape of the thermal imaging that occurred in this case that no "significant" compromise of the homeowner's privacy has occurred, we must take the long view, from the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Fourth Amendment is to be construed in the light of what was deemed an unreasonable search and seizure when it was adopted, and in a manner which will conserve public interests as well as the interests and rights of individual citizens." &lt;i&gt;Carroll&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 267 U. S. 132, 149 (1925).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where, as here, the Government uses a device that is not in general public use, to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion, the surveillance is a "search" and is presumptively unreasonable without a warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we hold the Thermovision imaging to have been an unlawful search, it will remain for the District Court to determine whether, without the evidence it provided, the search warrant issued in this case was supported by probable cause&#151;and if not, whether there is any other basis for supporting admission of the evidence that the search pursuant to the warrant produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*41&lt;/span&gt; * * *&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed; the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, in my judgment, a distinction of constitutional magnitude between "through-the-wall surveillance" that gives the observer or listener direct access to information in a private area, on the one hand, and the thought processes used to draw inferences from information in the public domain, on the other hand. The Court has crafted a rule that purports to deal with direct observations of the inside of the home, but the case before us merely involves indirect deductions from "off-the-wall" surveillance, that is, observations of the exterior of the home. Those observations were made with a fairly primitive thermal imager that gathered data exposed on the outside of petitioner's home but did not invade any constitutionally protected interest in privacy.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Moreover, I believe that the supposedly "bright-line" rule the Court has created in response to its concerns about future technological developments is unnecessary, unwise, and inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need for the Court to craft a new rule to decide this case, as it is controlled by established principles from &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*42&lt;/span&gt; our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. One of those core principles, of course, is that "searches and seizures &lt;i&gt;inside a home&lt;/i&gt; without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable." &lt;i&gt;Payton&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;New York,&lt;/i&gt; 445 U. S. 573, 586 (1980) (emphasis added). But it is equally well settled that searches and seizures of property in plain view are presumptively reasonable. See &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 586-587.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Whether that property is residential or commercial, the basic principle is the same: "`What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.' " &lt;i&gt;California&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ciraolo,&lt;/i&gt; 476 U. S. 207, 213 (1986) (quoting &lt;i&gt;Katz&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 389 U. S. 347, 351 (1967)); see &lt;i&gt;Florida&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Riley,&lt;/i&gt; 488 U. S. 445, 449-450 (1989); &lt;i&gt;California&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Greenwood,&lt;/i&gt; 486 U. S. 35, 40-41 (1988); &lt;i&gt;Dow Chemical Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 476 U. S. 227, 235-236 (1986); &lt;i&gt;Air Pollution Variance Bd. of Colo.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Western Alfalfa Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 416 U. S. 861, 865 (1974). That is the principle implicated here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Court "take[s] the long view" and decides this case based largely on the potential of yet-to-be-developed technology that might allow "through-the-wall surveillance," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 38-40; see &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 36, n. 3, this case involves nothing more than off-the-wall surveillance by law enforcement officers to gather information exposed to the general public from the outside of petitioner's home. All that the infrared camera did in this case was passively measure heat emitted &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*43&lt;/span&gt; from the exterior surfaces of petitioner's home; all that those measurements showed were relative differences in emission levels, vaguely indicating that some areas of the roof and outside walls were warmer than others. As still images from the infrared scans show, see Appendix, &lt;i&gt;infra,&lt;/i&gt;  no details regarding the interior of petitioner's home were revealed. Unlike an x-ray scan, or other possible "throughthe-wall" techniques, the detection of infrared radiation emanating from the home did not accomplish "an unauthorized physical penetration into the premises," &lt;i&gt;Silverman&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 365 U. S. 505, 509 (1961), nor did it "obtain information that it could not have obtained by observation from outside the curtilage of the house," &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Karo,&lt;/i&gt; 468 U. S. 705, 715 (1984).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the ordinary use of the senses might enable a neighbor or passerby to notice the heat emanating from a building, particularly if it is vented, as was the case here. Additionally, any member of the public might notice that one part of a house is warmer than another part or a nearby building if, for example, rainwater evaporates or snow melts at different rates across its surfaces. Such use of the senses would not convert into an unreasonable search if, instead, an adjoining neighbor allowed an officer onto her property to verify her perceptions with a sensitive thermometer. Nor, in my view, does such observation become an unreasonable search if made from a distance with the aid of a device that merely discloses that the exterior of one house, or one area of the house, is much warmer than another. Nothing more occurred in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the notion that heat emissions from the outside of a dwelling are a private matter implicating the protections of the Fourth Amendment (the text of which guarantees the right of people "to be secure &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; their . . . houses" against unreasonable searches and seizures (emphasis added)) is not only unprecedented but also quite difficult to take seriously. Heat waves, like aromas that are generated in a kitchen, or &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*44&lt;/span&gt; in a laboratory or opium den, enter the public domain if and when they leave a building. A subjective expectation that they would remain private is not only implausible but also surely not "one that society is prepared to recognize as `reasonable.' " &lt;i&gt;Katz,&lt;/i&gt; 389 U. S., at 361 (Harlan, J., concurring).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the homeowner has a reasonable expectation of privacy concerning what takes place within the home, and the Fourth Amendment's protection against physical invasions of the home should apply to their functional equivalent. But the equipment in this case did not penetrate the walls of petitioner's home, and while it did pick up "details of the home" that were exposed to the public, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 38, it did not obtain "any information regarding the &lt;i&gt;interior&lt;/i&gt; of the home," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 34 (emphasis added). In the Court's own words, based on what the thermal imager "showed" regarding the outside of petitioner's home, the officers "concluded" that petitioner was engaging in illegal activity inside the home. &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 30. It would be quite absurd to characterize their thought processes as "searches," regardless of whether they inferred (rightly) that petitioner was growing marijuana in his house, or (wrongly) that "the lady of the house [was taking] her daily sauna and bath." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 38. In either case, the only conclusions the officers reached concerning the interior of the home were at least as indirect as those that might have been inferred from the contents of discarded garbage, see &lt;i&gt;California&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Greenwood,&lt;/i&gt; 486 U. S. 35 (1988), or pen register data, see &lt;i&gt;Smith&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maryland,&lt;/i&gt;  442 U. S. 735 (1979), or, as in this case, subpoenaed utility records, see 190 F. 3d 1041, 1043 (CA9 1999). For the first time in its history, the Court assumes that an inference can amount to a Fourth Amendment violation. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt;  at 36-37.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*45&lt;/span&gt; Notwithstanding the implications of today's decision, there is a strong public interest in avoiding constitutional litigation over the monitoring of emissions from homes, and over the inferences drawn from such monitoring. Just as "the police cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes from evidence of criminal activity that could have been observed by any member of the public," &lt;i&gt;Greenwood,&lt;/i&gt; 486 U. S., at 41, so too public officials should not have to avert their senses or their equipment from detecting emissions in the public domain such as excessive heat, traces of smoke, suspicious odors, odorless gases, airborne particulates, or radioactive emissions, any of which could identify hazards to the community. In my judgment, monitoring such emissions with "sense-enhancing technology," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 34, and drawing useful conclusions from such monitoring, is an entirely reasonable public service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the countervailing privacy interest is at best trivial. After all, homes generally are insulated to keep heat in, rather than to prevent the detection of heat going out, and it does not seem to me that society will suffer from a rule requiring the rare homeowner who both intends to engage in uncommon activities that produce extraordinary amounts of heat, and wishes to conceal that production from outsiders, to make sure that the surrounding area is well insulated. Cf. &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Jacobsen,&lt;/i&gt; 466 U. S. 109, 122 (1984) ("The concept of an interest in privacy that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable is, by its very nature, critically different from the mere expectation, however well &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*46&lt;/span&gt; justified, that certain facts will not come to the attention of the authorities"). The interest in concealing the heat escaping from one's house pales in significance to "the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed," the "physical entry of the home," &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States Dist. Court for Eastern Dist. of Mich.,&lt;/i&gt; 407 U. S. 297, 313 (1972), and it is hard to believe that it is an interest the Framers sought to protect in our Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since what was involved in this case was nothing more than drawing inferences from off-the-wall surveillance, rather than any "through-the-wall" surveillance, the officers' conduct did not amount to a search and was perfectly reasonable.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to answer the question whether the use of the thermal imager in this case was even arguably unreasonable, the Court has fashioned a rule that is intended to provide essential guidance for the day when "more sophisticated systems" gain the "ability to `see' through walls and other opaque barriers." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 36, and n. 3. The newly minted rule encompasses "obtaining [1] by senseenhancing technology [2] any information regarding the interior of the home [3] that could not otherwise have been obtained without physical intrusion into a constitutionally protected area . . . [4] at least where (as here) the technology in question is not in general public use." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 34 (internal quotation marks omitted). In my judgment, the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*47&lt;/span&gt; Court's new rule is at once too broad and too narrow, and is not justified by the Court's explanation for its adoption. As I have suggested, I would not erect a constitutional impediment to the use of sense-enhancing technology unless it provides its user with the functional equivalent of actual presence in the area being searched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the Court's attempt to draw a line that is "not only firm but also bright," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 40, the contours of its new rule are uncertain because its protection apparently dissipates as soon as the relevant technology is "in general public use," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 34. Yet how much use is general public use is not even hinted at by the Court's opinion, which makes the somewhat doubtful assumption that the thermal imager used in this case does not satisfy that criterion.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; In any event, putting aside its lack of clarity, this criterion is somewhat perverse because it seems likely that the threat to privacy will grow, rather than recede, as the use of intrusive equipment becomes more readily available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear, however, that the category of "sense-enhancing technology" covered by the new rule, &lt;i&gt;ibid.,&lt;/i&gt; is far too broad. It would, for example, embrace potential mechanical substitutes for dogs trained to react when they sniff narcotics. But in &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Place,&lt;/i&gt; 462 U. S. 696, 707 (1983), we held that a dog sniff that "discloses only the presence or absence of narcotics" does "not constitute a `search' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment," and it must follow that sense-enhancing equipment that identifies nothing but illegal &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*48&lt;/span&gt; activity is not a search either. Nevertheless, the use of such a device would be unconstitutional under the Court's rule, as would the use of other new devices that might detect the odor of deadly bacteria or chemicals for making a new type of high explosive, even if the devices (like the dog sniffs) are "so limited both in the manner in which" they obtain information and "in the content of the information" they reveal. &lt;i&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt; If nothing more than that sort of information could be obtained by using the devices in a public place to monitor emissions from a house, then their use would be no more objectionable than the use of the thermal imager in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of the Court's new rule to "any information regarding the interior of the home," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 34, is also unnecessarily broad. If it takes sensitive equipment to detect an odor that identifies criminal conduct and nothing else, the fact that the odor emanates from the interior of a home should not provide it with constitutional protection. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 47 and this page. The criterion, moreover, is too sweeping in that information "regarding" the interior of a home apparently is not just information obtained through its walls, but also information concerning the outside of the building that could lead to (however many) inferences "regarding" what might be inside. Under that expansive view, I suppose, an officer using an infrared camera to observe a man silently entering the side door of a house at night carrying a pizza might conclude that its interior is now occupied by someone who likes pizza, and by doing so the officer would be guilty of conducting an unconstitutional "search" of the home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the new rule applies to information regarding the "interior" of the home, it is too narrow as well as too broad. Clearly, a rule that is designed to protect individuals from the overly intrusive use of sense-enhancing equipment should not be limited to a home. If such equipment &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*49&lt;/span&gt; did provide its user with the functional equivalent of access to a private place&#151;such as, for example, the telephone booth involved in &lt;i&gt;Katz,&lt;/i&gt; or an office building&#151;then the rule should apply to such an area as well as to a home. See &lt;i&gt;Katz,&lt;/i&gt; 389 U. S., at 351 ("[T]he Fourth Amendment protects people, not places").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final requirement of the Court's new rule, that the information "could not otherwise have been obtained without physical intrusion into a constitutionally protected area," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 34 (internal quotation marks omitted), also extends too far as the Court applies it. As noted, the Court effectively treats the mental process of analyzing data obtained from external sources as the equivalent of a physical intrusion into the home. See &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 44. As I have explained, however, the process of drawing inferences from data in the public domain should not be characterized as a search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two reasons advanced by the Court as justifications for the adoption of its new rule are both unpersuasive. First, the Court suggests that its rule is compelled by our holding in &lt;i&gt;Katz,&lt;/i&gt; because in that case, as in this, the surveillance consisted of nothing more than the monitoring of waves emanating from a private area into the public domain. See &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 35. Yet there are critical differences between the cases. In &lt;i&gt;Katz,&lt;/i&gt; the electronic listening device attached to the outside of the phone booth allowed the officers to pick up the content of the conversation inside the booth, making them the functional equivalent of intruders because they gathered information that was otherwise available only to someone inside the private area; it would be as if, in this case, the thermal imager presented a view of the heat-generating activity inside petitioner's home. By contrast, the thermal imager here disclosed only the relative amounts of heat radiating from the house; it would be as if, in &lt;i&gt;Katz,&lt;/i&gt; the listening device disclosed only the relative &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*50&lt;/span&gt; volume of sound leaving the booth, which presumably was discernible in the public domain.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; Surely, there is a significant difference between the general and well-settled expectation that strangers will not have direct access to the contents of private communications, on the one hand, and the rather theoretical expectation that an occasional homeowner would even care if anybody noticed the relative amounts of heat emanating from the walls of his house, on the other. It is pure hyperbole for the Court to suggest that refusing to extend the holding of &lt;i&gt;Katz&lt;/i&gt; to this case would leave the homeowner at the mercy of "technology that could discern all human activity in the home." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 35-36.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the Court argues that the permissibility of "through-the-wall surveillance" cannot depend on a distinction between observing "intimate details" such as "the lady of the house [taking] her daily sauna and bath," and noticing only "the nonintimate rug on the vestibule floor" or "objects no smaller than 36 by 36 inches." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 37, 38-39. This entire argument assumes, of course, that the thermal imager in this case could or did perform "through-thewall surveillance" that could identify any detail "that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion." &lt;i&gt;Ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 39-40. In fact, the device could not, see n. 1, &lt;i&gt;supra,&lt;/i&gt; and did not, see Appendix, &lt;i&gt;infra,&lt;/i&gt; enable its user to identify either the lady of the house, the rug on the vestibule floor, or anything else inside the house, whether smaller or larger than 36 by 36 inches. Indeed, the vague thermal images of petitioner's home that are reproduced in the Appendix were submitted by him to the District Court as part of an expert report raising the question whether the device could even take "accurate, consistent infrared images" of the &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*51&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;outside&lt;/i&gt; of his house. Defendant's Exh. 107, p. 4. But even if the device could reliably show extraordinary differences in the amounts of heat leaving his home, drawing the inference that there was something suspicious occurring inside the residence&#151;a conclusion that officers far less gifted than Sherlock Holmes would readily draw&#151;does not qualify as "through-the-wall surveillance," much less a Fourth Amendment violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Court is properly and commendably concerned about the threats to privacy that may flow from advances in the technology available to the law enforcement profession, it has unfortunately failed to heed the tried and true counsel of judicial restraint. Instead of concentrating on the rather mundane issue that is actually presented by the case before it, the Court has endeavored to craft an all-encompassing rule for the future. It would be far wiser to give legislators an unimpeded opportunity to grapple with these emerging issues rather than to shackle them with prematurely devised constitutional constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I respectfully dissent. [Appendix to opinion of Stevens, J., follows this page.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*52&lt;/span&gt; APPENDIX TO OPINION OF STEVENS, J.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Images and text reproduced from defendant's exhibit 107) Top left: Infrared image of a video frame from the videotape submitted as evidence in this case. The thermogram indicates the suspect house as it appeared with the Gain and contrast in its default setting. Only the outline of the house is visible. The camera used was the Thermovision 210. Top Right: Infrared image of a subsequent videoframe taken from the videotape. The gain and contrast settings have been increased in order to make the walls and roof of the structure appear hotter than what it actually is. Bottom Left: Infrared image of the opposite side of the suspects house. The thermogram is also taken from the same videotape. The camera settings are in the default mode and the outline of the house is barely visible. Only the hot electrical transformer and the street light are identifiable. Bottom Right: The same image, but with the gain and contrast increased. This change in camera settings cause any object to appear hotter than what it actually is. The arrow indicates the overloading of an area immediately around a hot object in this case the electrical transformer and the streetlight. This overloading of the image is an inherent design flaw in the camera itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*]   Briefs of &lt;i&gt;amici curiae&lt;/i&gt; urging reversal were filed for the Liberty Project by &lt;i&gt;Julie M. Carpenter;&lt;/i&gt; and for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. by &lt;i&gt;James J. Tomkovicz, Lisa B. Kemler,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Steven R. Shapiro.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  When the Fourth Amendment was adopted, as now, to "search" meant "[t]o look over or through for the purpose of finding something; to explore; to examine by inspection; as, to &lt;i&gt;search&lt;/i&gt; the house for a book; to &lt;i&gt;search&lt;/i&gt; the wood for a thief." N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 66 (1828) (reprint 6th ed. 1989).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  The dissent's repeated assertion that the thermal imaging did not obtain information regarding the interior of the home, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 43, 44 (opinion of Stevens, J.), is simply inaccurate. A thermal imager reveals the relative heat of various rooms in the home. The dissent may not find that information particularly private or important, see &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 43-44, 45, 49-50, but there is no basis for saying it is not information regarding the interior of the home. The dissent's comparison of the thermal imaging to various circumstances in which outside observers might be able to perceive, without technology, the heat of the home&#151;for example, by observing snowmelt on the roof, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 43&#151;is quite irrelevant. The fact that equivalent information could sometimes be obtained by other means does not make lawful the use of means that violate the Fourth Amendment. The police might, for example, learn how many people are in a particular house by setting up year-round surveillance; but that does not make breaking and entering to find out the same information lawful. In any event, on the night of January 16, 1992, no outside observer could have discerned the relative heat of Kyllo's home without thermal imaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  The ability to "see" through walls and other opaque barriers is a clear, and scientifically feasible, goal of law enforcement research and development. The National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center, a program within the United States Department of Justice, features on its Internet Website projects that include a "RadarBased Through-the-Wall Surveillance System," "Handheld Ultrasound Through the Wall Surveillance," and a "Radar Flashlight" that "will enable law enforcement officers to detect individuals through interior building walls." www.nlectc.org/techproj/ (visited May 3, 2001). Some devices may emit low levels of radiation that travel "through-the-wall," but others, such as more sophisticated thermal-imaging devices, are entirely passive, or "off-the-wall" as the dissent puts it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  The dissent asserts, &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 44-45, n. 3, that we have misunderstood its point, which is not that inference &lt;i&gt;insulates&lt;/i&gt; a search, but that inference alone is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a search. If we misunderstood the point, it was only in a good-faith effort to render the point germane to the case at hand. The issue in this case is not the police's allegedly unlawful inferencing, but their allegedly unlawful thermal-imaging measurement of the emanations from a house. We say such measurement is a search; the dissent says it is not, because an inference is not a search. We took that to mean that, since the technologically enhanced emanations had to be the basis of inferences before anything inside the house could be known, the use of the emanations could not be a search. But the dissent certainly knows better than we what it intends. And if it means only that an inference is not a search, we certainly agree. That has no bearing, however, upon whether hi-tech measurement of emanations from a house is a search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  The Government cites our statement in &lt;i&gt;California&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ciraolo,&lt;/i&gt; 476 U. S. 207 (1986), noting apparent agreement with the State of California that aerial surveillance of a house's curtilage could become "`invasive' " if "`modern technology' " revealed "`those intimate associations, objects or activities otherwise imperceptible to police or fellow citizens.' " &lt;i&gt;Id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 215, n.3 (quoting Brief for State of California 14-15). We think the Court's focus in this secondhand dictum was not upon intimacy but upon otherwise-imperceptibility, which is precisely the principle we vindicate today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  The dissent argues that we have injected potential uncertainty into the constitutional analysis by noting that whether or not the technology is in general public use may be a factor. See &lt;i&gt;post,&lt;/i&gt; at 47. That quarrel, however, is not with us but with this Court's precedent. See &lt;i&gt;Ciraolo, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 215 ("In an age where private and commercial flight in the public airways is routine, it is unreasonable for respondent to expect that his marijuana plants were constitutionally protected from being observed with the naked eye from an altitude of 1,000 feet"). Given that we can quite confidently say that thermal imaging is not "routine," we decline in this case to reexamine that factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court found: "[T]he use of the thermal imaging device here was not an intrusion into Kyllo's home. No intimate details of the home were observed, and there was no intrusion upon the privacy of the individuals within the home. The device used cannot penetrate walls or windows to reveal conversations or human activities. The device recorded only the heat being emitted from the home." Supp. App. to Pet. for Cert. 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Thus, for example, we have found consistent with the Fourth Amendment, even absent a warrant, the search and seizure of garbage left for collection outside the curtilage of a home, &lt;i&gt;California&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Greenwood,&lt;/i&gt; 486 U. S. 35 (1988); the aerial surveillance of a fenced-in backyard from an altitude of 1,000 feet, &lt;i&gt;California&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ciraolo,&lt;/i&gt; 476 U. S. 207 (1986); the aerial observation of a partially exposed interior of a residential greenhouse from 400 feet above, &lt;i&gt;Florida&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Riley,&lt;/i&gt; 488 U. S. 445 (1989); the aerial photography of an industrial complex from several thousand feet above, &lt;i&gt;Dow Chemical Co.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;United States,&lt;/i&gt; 476 U. S. 227 (1986); and the observation of smoke emanating from chimney stacks, &lt;i&gt;Air Pollution Variance Bd. of Colo.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Western Alfalfa Corp.,&lt;/i&gt; 416 U. S. 861 (1974).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Although the Court credits us with the "novel proposition that inference insulates a search," &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; at 36, our point simply is that an inference cannot &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; a search, contrary to the Court's reasoning. See &lt;i&gt;supra&lt;/i&gt;  this page. Thus, the Court's use of &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Karo,&lt;/i&gt; 468 U. S. 705 (1984), to refute a point we do not make underscores the fact that the Court has no real answer (either in logic or in law) to the point we do make. Of course, &lt;i&gt;Karo&lt;/i&gt; itself does not provide any support for the Court's view that inferences can amount to unconstitutional searches. The illegality in that case was "the monitoring of a beeper in a private residence" to obtain information that "could not have [been] obtained by observation from outside," &lt;i&gt;id.,&lt;/i&gt; at 714-715, rather than any thought processes that flowed from such monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  This view comports with that of all the Courts of Appeals that have resolved the issue. See 190 F. 3d 1041 (CA9 1999); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Robinson,&lt;/i&gt; 62 F. 3d 1325 (CA11 1995) (upholding warrantless use of thermal imager); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Myers,&lt;/i&gt; 46 F. 3d 668 (CA7 1995) (same); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Ishmael,&lt;/i&gt; 48 F. 3d 850 (CA5 1995) (same); &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Pinson,&lt;/i&gt;  24 F. 3d 1056 (CA8 1994) (same). But see &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Cusumano,&lt;/i&gt;  67 F. 3d 1497 (CA10 1995) (warrantless use of thermal imager violated Fourth Amendment), vacated and decided on other grounds, 83 F. 3d 1247 (CA10 1996) (en banc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  The record describes a device that numbers close to a thousand manufactured units; that has a predecessor numbering in the neighborhood of 4,000 to 5,000 units; that competes with a similar product numbering from 5,000 to 6,000 units; and that is "readily available to the public" for commercial, personal, or law enforcement purposes, and is just an 800number away from being rented from "half a dozen national companies" by anyone who wants one. App. 18. Since, by virtue of the Court's new rule, the issue is one of first impression, perhaps it should order an evidentiary hearing to determine whether these facts suffice to establish "general public use."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  The use of the latter device would be constitutional given &lt;i&gt;Smith&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maryland,&lt;/i&gt; 442 U. S.735, 741 (1979),which upheld the use of pen registers to record numbers dialed on a phone because, unlike "the listening device employed in &lt;i&gt;Katz&lt;/i&gt; . .. pen registers do not acquire the &lt;i&gt;contents&lt;/i&gt;  of communications."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="docket"&gt;No. 99-2036.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="court"&gt;SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="date"&gt;Argued February 28, 2001&lt;br&gt;Decided June 11, 2001&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="prelims"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Syllabus&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Under New York law, respondent Milford Central School (Milford) enacted a policy authorizing district residents to use its building after school for, among other things, (1) instruction in education, learning, or the arts and (2) social, civic, recreational, and entertainment uses pertaining to the community welfare. Stephen and Darleen Fournier, district residents eligible to use the school's facilities upon approval of their proposed use, are sponsors of the Good News Club, a private Christian organization for children ages 6 to 12. Pursuant to Milford's policy, they submitted a request to hold the Club's weekly afterschool meetings in the school. Milford denied the request on the ground that the proposed use-to sing songs, hear Bible lessons, memorize scripture, and pray-was the equivalent of religious worship prohibited by the community use policy. Petitioners (collectively, the Club), filed suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983 alleging, inter alia, that the denial of the Club's application violated its free speech rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court ultimately granted Milford summary judgment, finding the Club's subject matter to be religious in nature, not merely a discussion of secular matters from a religious perspective that Milford otherwise permits. Because the school had not allowed other groups providing religious instruction to use its limited public forum, the court held that it could deny the Club access without engaging in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. In affirming, the Second Circuit rejected the Club's contention that Milford's restriction was unreasonable, and held that, because the Club's subject matter was quintessentially religious and its activities fell outside the bounds of pure moral and character development, Milford's policy was constitutional subject discrimination, not unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Held:   1. Milford violated the Club's free speech rights when it excluded the Club from meeting after hours at the school. Pp. 5-11.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(a) Because the parties so agree, this Court assumes that Milford operates a limited public forum. A State establishing such a forum is not required to and does not allow persons to engage in every type of speech. It may be justified in reserving its forum for certain groups or the discussion of certain topics. E.g., Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B4V/rosenberger-v-rector-and-visitors-of-univ-of-va/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;515&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;819&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 829. The power to so restrict speech, however, is not without limits. The restriction must not discriminate against speech based on viewpoint, ibid., and must be reasonable in light of the forum's purpose, Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp;amp; Ed. Fund, Inc., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z9H/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;473&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;788&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 806. Pp. 5-6.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(b) By denying the Club access to the school's limited public forum on the ground that the Club was religious in nature, Milford discriminated against the Club because of its religious viewpoint in violation of the Free Speech Clause. That exclusion is indistinguishable from the exclusions held violative of the Clause in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zy7/lambs-chapel-v-center-moriches-union-free-school-d/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;508&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;384&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, where a school district precluded a private group from presenting films at the school based solely on the religious perspective of the films, and in Rosenberger, where a university refused to fund a student publication because it addressed issues from a religious perspective. The only apparent difference between the activities of Lamb's Chapel and the Club is the inconsequential distinction that the Club teaches moral lessons from a Christian perspective through live storytelling and prayer, whereas Lamb's Chapel taught lessons through films. Rosenberger also is dispositive: Given the obvious religious content of the publication there at issue, it cannot be said that the Club's activities are any more "religious" or deserve any less Free Speech Clause protection. This Court disagrees with the Second Circuit's view that something that is quintessentially religious or decidedly religious in nature cannot also be characterized properly as the teaching of morals and character development from a particular viewpoint. What matters for Free Speech Clause purposes is that there is no logical difference in kind between the invocation of Christianity by the Club and the invocation of teamwork, loyalty, or patriotism by other associations to provide a foundation for their lessons. Because Milford's restriction is viewpoint discriminatory, the Court need not decide whether it is unreasonable in light of the forum's purposes. Pp. 6-11.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;2. Permitting the Club to meet on the school's premises would not have violated the Establishment Clause. Establishment Clause defenses similar to Milford's were rejected in Lamb's Chapel, supra, at 395-where the Court found that, because the films would not have been shown during school hours, would not have been sponsored by the school, and would have been open to the public, not just to church members, there was no realistic danger that the community would think that the district was endorsing religion-and in Widmar v. Vincent, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ySF/widmar-v-vincent/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;454&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;263&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 272-273, and n. 13-where a university's forum was already available to other groups. Because the Club's activities are materially indistinguishable from those in Lamb's Chapel and Widmar, Milford's reliance on the Establishment Clause is unavailing. As in Lamb's Chapel, the Club's meetings were to be held after school hours, not sponsored by the school, and open to any student who obtained parental consent, not just to Club members. As in Widmar, Milford made its forum available to other organizations. The Court rejects Milford's attempt to distinguish those cases by emphasizing that its policy involves elementary school children who will perceive that the school is endorsing the Club and will feel coerced to participate because the Club's activities take place on school grounds, even though they occur during nonschool hours. That argument is unpersuasive for a number of reasons. (1) Allowing the Club to speak on school grounds would ensure, not threaten, neutrality toward religion. Accordingly, Milford faces an uphill battle in arguing that the Establishment Clause compels it to exclude the Club. See, e.g., Rosenberger, supra, at 839. (2) To the extent the Court considers whether the community would feel coercive pressure to engage in the Club's activities, cf. Lee v. Weisman, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zwt/lee-v-weisman/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;505&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;577&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 592-593, the relevant community is the parents who choose whether their children will attend Club meetings, not the children themselves. (3) Whatever significance it may have assigned in the Establishment Clause context to the suggestion that elementary school children are more impressionable than adults, cf., e.g., id., at 592, the Court has never foreclosed private religious conduct during nonschool hours merely because it takes place on school premises where elementary school children may be present. Lee, supra, at 592, and Edwards v. Aguillard, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;482&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;578&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 584, distinguished. (4) Even if the Court were to consider the possible misperceptions by schoolchildren in deciding whether there is an Establishment Clause violation, the facts of this case simply do not support Milford's conclusion. Finally, it cannot be said that the danger that children would misperceive the endorsement of religion is any greater than the danger that they would perceive a hostility toward the religious viewpoint if the Club were excluded from the public forum. Because it is not convinced that there is any significance to the possibility that elementary school children may witness the Club's activities on school premises, the Court can find no reason to depart from Lamb's Chapel and Widmar. Pp. 12-20.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;3. Because Milford has not raised a valid Establishment Clause claim, this Court does not address whether such a claim could excuse Milford's viewpoint discrimination. Pp. 12, 20.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca2/4W9w/the-good-news-club-andrea-fournier-and-darleen-fou/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;202&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;502&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, reversed and remanded.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Scalia, and Kennedy, JJ., joined, and in which Breyer, JJ., joined in part.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Opinion of the Court&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p1"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This case presents two questions. The first question is whether Milford Central School violated the free speech rights of the Good News Club when it excluded the Club from meeting after hours at the school. The second question is whether any such violation is justified by Milford's concern that permitting the Club's activities would violate the Establishment Clause. We conclude that Milford's restriction violates the Club's free speech rights and that no Establishment Clause concern justifies that violation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p2"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;* The State of New York authorizes local school boards to adopt regulations governing the use of their school facilities. In particular, N. Y. Educ. Law 414 (McKinney 2000) enumerates several purposes for which local boards may open their schools to public use. In 1992, respondent Milford Central School (Milford) enacted a community use policy adopting seven of 414's purposes for which its building could be used after school. App. to Pet. for Cert. D1-D3. Two of the stated purposes are relevant here. First, district residents may use the school for "instruction in any branch of education, learning or the arts." Id., at D1. Second, the school is available for "social, civic and recreational meetings and entertainment events, and other uses pertaining to the welfare of the community, provided that such uses shall be nonexclusive and shall be opened to the general public." Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p3"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Stephen and Darleen Fournier reside within Milford's district and therefore are eligible to use the school's facilities as long as their proposed use is approved by the school. Together they are sponsors of the local Good News Club, a private Christian organization for children ages 6 to 12. Pursuant to Milford's policy, in September 1996 the Fourniers submitted a request to Dr. Robert McGruder, interim superintendent of the district, in which they sought permission to hold the Club's weekly afterschool meetings in the school cafeteria. App. in No. 98-9494 (CA2), p. A-81. The next month, McGruder formally denied the Fourniers' request on the ground that the proposed use-to have "a fun time of singing songs, hearing a Bible lesson and memorizing scripture," ibid.-was "the equivalent of religious worship." App. H1-H2. According to McGruder, the community use policy, which prohibits use "by any individual or organization for religious purposes," foreclosed the Club's activities. App. to Pet. for Cert. D2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p4"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In response to a letter submitted by the Club's counsel, Milford's attorney requested information to clarify the nature of the Club's activities. The Club sent a set of materials used or distributed at the meetings and the following description of its meeting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p5"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"The Club opens its session with Ms. Fournier taking attendance. As she calls a child's name, if the child recites a Bible verse the child receives a treat. After attendance, the Club sings songs. Next Club members engage in games that involve, inter alia, learning Bible verses. Ms. Fournier then relates a Bible story and explains how it applies to Club members' lives. The Club closes with prayer. Finally, Ms. Fournier distributes treats and the Bible verses for memorization." App. in No. 98-9494 (CA2), at A30.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p6"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;McGruder and Milford's attorney reviewed the materials and concluded that "the kinds of activities proposed to be engaged in by the Good News Club were not a discussion of secular subjects such as child rearing, development of character and development of morals from a religious perspective, but were in fact the equivalent of religious instruction itself." Id., at A25. In February 1997, the Milford Board of Education adopted a resolution rejecting the Club's request to use Milford's facilities "for the purpose of conducting religious instruction and Bible study." Id., at A56.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p7"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In March 1997, petitioners, the Good News Club, Ms. Fournier, and her daughter Andrea Fournier (collectively, the Club), filed an action under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against Milford in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The Club alleged that Milford's denial of its application violated its free speech rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, its right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment, and its right to religious freedom under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, 107 Stat. 1488, 42 U.S.C.  2000bb et seq.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p8"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Club moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the school from enforcing its religious exclusion policy against the Club and thereby to permit the Club's use of the school facilities. On April 14, 1997, the District Court granted the injunction. The Club then held its weekly afterschool meetings from April 1997 until June 1998 in a high school resource and middle school special education room. App. N12.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p9"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In August 1998, the District Court vacated the preliminary injunction and granted Milford's motion for summary judgment. &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/nynd/edgu/the-good-news-club-v-milford-cent-school/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;147&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (NDNY 1998). The court found that the Club's "subject matter is decidedly religious in nature, and not merely a discussion of secular matters from a religious perspective that is otherwise permitted under [Milford's] use policies." Id., at 154. Because the school had not permitted other groups that provided religious instruction to use its limited public forum, the court held that the school could deny access to the Club without engaging in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. The court also rejected the Club's equal protection claim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p10"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Club appealed, and a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca2/4W9w/the-good-news-club-andrea-fournier-and-darleen-fou/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;202&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;502&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (2000). First, the court rejected the Club's contention that Milford's restriction against allowing religious instruction in its facilities is unreasonable. Second, it held that, because the subject matter of the Club's activities is "quintessentially religious," id., at 510, and the activities "fall outside the bounds of pure 'moral and character development,' " id., at 511, Milford's policy of excluding the Club's meetings was constitutional subject discrimination, not unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. Judge Jacobs filed a dissenting opinion in which he concluded that the school's restriction did constitute viewpoint discrimination under Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zy7/lambs-chapel-v-center-moriches-union-free-school-d/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;508&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;384&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1993).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p11"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There is a conflict among the Courts of Appeals on the question whether speech can be excluded from a limited public forum on the basis of the religious nature of the speech. Compare Gentala v. Tucson, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca9/4XFq/patricia-e-gentala-and-robert-a-gentalaplaintiffs-/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;244&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1065&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CA9 2001) (en banc) (holding that a city properly refused National Day of Prayer organizers' application to the city's civic events fund for coverage of costs for city services); Campbell v. St. Tammany's School Bd., &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;206&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;482&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CA5 2000) (holding that a school's policy against permitting religious instruction in its limited public forum did not constitute viewpoint discrimination), cert. pending, No. 00-1194; Bronx Household of Faith v. Community School Dist. No. 10, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca2/4Q6X/the-bronx-household-of-faith-jack-roberts-robert-h/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;127&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;207&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CA2 1997) (concluding that a ban on religious services and instruction in the limited public forum was constitutional), with Church on the Rock v. Albuquerque, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca10/4FDn/church-on-the-rock-don-kimbro-pastor-v-city-of-alb/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;84&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1273&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CA10 1996) (holding that a city's denial of permission to show the film Jesus in a senior center was unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination); and Good News/Good Sports Club v. School Dist. of Ladue, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca8/4siM/the-good-newsgood-sports-club-an-unincorporated-as/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1501&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CA8 1994) (holding unconstitutional a school use policy that prohibited Good News Club from meeting during times when the Boy Scouts could meet). We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;531&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;923&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;II&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p12"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The standards that we apply to determine whether a State has unconstitutionally excluded a private speaker from use of a public forum depend on the nature of the forum. See Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yXC/perry-ed-assn-v-perry-local-educators-assn/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;460&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;37&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 44 (1983). If the forum is a traditional or open public forum, the State's restrictions on speech are subject to stricter scrutiny than are restrictions in a limited public forum. Id., at 45-46. We have previously declined to decide whether a school district's opening of its facilities pursuant to N. Y. Educ. Law 414 creates a limited or a traditional public forum. See Lamb's Chapel, supra, at 391-392. Because the parties have agreed that Milford created a limited public forum when it opened its facilities in 1992, see Brief for Petitioners 15-17; Brief for Respondent 26, we need not resolve the issue here. Instead, we simply will assume that Milford operates a limited public forum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p13"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When the State establishes a limited public forum, the State is not required to and does not allow persons to engage in every type of speech. The State may be justified "in reserving [its forum] for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics." Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B4V/rosenberger-v-rector-and-visitors-of-univ-of-va/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;515&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;819&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 829 (1995); see also Lamb's Chapel, supra, at 392-393. The State's power to restrict speech, however, is not without limits. The restriction must not discriminate against speech on the basis of viewpoint, Rosenberger, supra, at 829, and the restriction must be "reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum," Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp;amp; Ed. Fund, Inc., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z9H/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;473&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;788&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 806 (1985).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;III&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p14"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Applying this test, we first address whether the exclusion constituted viewpoint discrimination. We are guided in our analysis by two of our prior opinions, Lamb's Chapel and Rosenberger. In Lamb's Chapel, we held that a school district violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment when it excluded a private group from presenting films at the school based solely on the films' discussions of family values from a religious perspective. Likewise, in Rosenberger, we held that a university's refusal to fund a student publication because the publication addressed issues from a religious perspective violated the Free Speech Clause. Concluding that Milford's exclusion of the Good News Club based on its religious nature is indistinguishable from the exclusions in these cases, we hold that the exclusion constitutes viewpoint discrimination. Because the restriction is viewpoint discriminatory, we need not decide whether it is unreasonable in light of the purposes served by the forum.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p15"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Milford has opened its limited public forum to activities that serve a variety of purposes, including events "pertaining to the welfare of the community." App. to Pet. for Cert. D1. Milford interprets its policy to permit discussions of subjects such as child rearing, and of "the development of character and morals from a religious perspective." Brief for Appellee in No. 98-9494 (CA2), p. 6. For example, this policy would allow someone to use Aesop's Fables to teach children moral values. App. N11. Additionally, a group could sponsor a debate on whether there should be a constitutional amendment to permit prayer in public schools, id., at N6, and the Boy Scouts could meet "to influence a boy's character, development and spiritual growth," id., at N10-N11. In short, any group that "promote[s] the moral and character development of children" is eligible to use the school building. Brief for Appellee in No. 98-9494 (CA2), at 9.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p16"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Just as there is no question that teaching morals and character development to children is a permissible purpose under Milford's policy, it is clear that the Club teaches morals and character development to children. For example, no one disputes that the Club instructs children to overcome feelings of jealousy, to treat others well regardless of how they treat the children, and to be obedient, even if it does so in a nonsecular way. Nonetheless, because Milford found the Club's activities to be religious in nature-"the equivalent of religious instruction itself," 202 F.3d, at 507-it excluded the Club from use of its facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p17"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Applying Lamb's Chapel,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; we find it quite clear that Milford engaged in viewpoint discrimination when it excluded the Club from the afterschool forum. In Lamb's Chapel, the local New York school district similarly had adopted 414's "social, civic or recreational use" category as a permitted use in its limited public forum. The district also prohibited use "by any group for religious purposes." 508 U.S., at 387. Citing this prohibition, the school district excluded a church that wanted to present films teaching family values from a Christian perspective. We held that, because the films "no doubt dealt with a subject otherwise permissible" under the rule, the teaching of family values, the district's exclusion of the church was unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. Id., at 394.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p18"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Like the church in Lamb's Chapel, the Club seeks to address a subject otherwise permitted under the rule, the teaching of morals and character, from a religious standpoint. Certainly, one could have characterized the film presentations in Lamb's Chapel as a religious use, as the Court of Appeals did, Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca2/3Ypa/lambs-chapel-and-john-steigerwald-v-center-moriche/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;959&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;381&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 388-389 (CA2 1992). And one easily could conclude that the films' purpose to instruct that " 'society's slide toward humanism ... can only be counterbalanced by a loving home where Christian values are instilled from an early age,' " id., at 384, was "quintessentially religious," 202 F.3d, at 510. The only apparent difference between the activity of Lamb's Chapel and the activities of the Good News Club is that the Club chooses to teach moral lessons from a Christian perspective through live storytelling and prayer, whereas Lamb's Chapel taught lessons through films. This distinction is inconsequential. Both modes of speech use a religious viewpoint. Thus, the exclusion of the Good News Club's activities, like the exclusion of Lamb's Chapel's films, constitutes unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p19"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our opinion in Rosenberger also is dispositive. In Rosenberger, a student organization at the University of Virginia was denied funding for printing expenses because its publication, Wide Awake, offered a Christian viewpoint. Just as the Club emphasizes the role of Christianity in students' morals and character, Wide Awake " 'challenge[d] Christians to live, in word and deed, according to the faith they proclaim and ... encourage[d] students to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means.' " 515 U.S., at 826. Because the university "select[ed] for disfavored treatment those student journalistic efforts with religious editorial viewpoints," we held that the denial of funding was unconstitutional. Id., at 831. Although in Rosenberger there was no prohibition on religion as a subject matter, our holding did not rely on this factor. Instead, we concluded simply that the university's denial of funding to print Wide Awake was viewpoint discrimination, just as the school district's refusal to allow Lamb's Chapel to show its films was viewpoint discrimination. Ibid. Given the obvious religious content of Wide Awake, we cannot say that the Club's activities are any more "religious" or deserve any less First Amendment protection than did the publication of Wide Awake in Rosenberger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p20"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Despite our holdings in Lamb's Chapel and Rosenberger, the Court of Appeals, like Milford, believed that its characterization of the Club's activities as religious in nature warranted treating the Club's activities as different in kind from the other activities permitted by the school. See 202 F.3d, at 510 (the Club "is doing something other than simply teaching moral values"). The "Christian viewpoint" is unique, according to the court, because it contains an "additional layer" that other kinds of viewpoints do not. Id., at 509. That is, the Club "is focused on teaching children how to cultivate their relationship with God through Jesus Christ," which it characterized as "quintessentially religious." Id., at 510. With these observations, the court concluded that, because the Club's activities "fall outside the bounds of pure 'moral and character development,' " the exclusion did not constitute viewpoint discrimination. Id., at 511.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p21"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We disagree that something that is "quintessentially religious" or "decidedly religious in nature" cannot also be characterized properly as the teaching of morals and character development from a particular viewpoint. See 202 F.3d, at 512 (Jacobs, J., dissenting) ("[W]hen the subject matter is morals and character, it is quixotic to attempt a distinction between religious viewpoints and religious subject matters"). What matters for purposes of the Free Speech Clause is that we can see no logical difference in kind between the invocation of Christianity by the Club and the invocation of teamwork, loyalty, or patriotism by other associations to provide a foundation for their lessons. It is apparent that the unstated principle of the Court of Appeals' reasoning is its conclusion that any time religious instruction and prayer are used to discuss morals and character, the discussion is simply not a "pure" discussion of those issues. According to the Court of Appeals, reliance on Christian principles taints moral and character instruction in a way that other foundations for thought or viewpoints do not. We, however, have never reached such a conclusion. Instead, we reaffirm our holdings in Lamb's Chapel and Rosenberger that speech discussing otherwise permissible subjects cannot be excluded from a limited public forum on the ground that the subject is discussed from a religious viewpoint. Thus, we conclude that Milford's exclusion of the Club from use of the school, pursuant to its community use policy, constitutes impermissible viewpoint discrimination.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IV&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p22"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Milford argues that, even if its restriction constitutes viewpoint discrimination, its interest in not violating the Establishment Clause outweighs the Club's interest in gaining equal access to the school's facilities. In other words, according to Milford, its restriction was required to avoid violating the Establishment Clause. We disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p23"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We have said that a state interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation "may be characterized as compelling," and therefore may justify content-based discrimination. Widmar v. Vincent, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ySF/widmar-v-vincent/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;454&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;263&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 271 (1981). However, it is not clear whether a State's interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation would justify viewpoint discrimination. See Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S., at 394-395 (noting the suggestion in Widmar but ultimately not finding an Establishment Clause problem). We need not, however, confront the issue in this case, because we conclude that the school has no valid Establishment Clause interest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p24"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We rejected Establishment Clause defenses similar to Milford's in two previous free speech cases, Lamb's Chapel and Widmar. In particular, in Lamb's Chapel, we explained that "[t]he showing of th[e] film series would not have been during school hours, would not have been sponsored by the school, and would have been open to the public, not just to church members." 508 U.S., at 395. Accordingly, we found that "there would have been no realistic danger that the community would think that the District was endorsing religion or any particular creed." Ibid. Likewise, in Widmar, where the university's forum was already available to other groups, this Court concluded that there was no Establishment Clause problem. 454 U.S., at 272-273, and n. 13.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p25"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Establishment Clause defense fares no better in this case. As in Lamb's Chapel, the Club's meetings were held after school hours, not sponsored by the school, and open to any student who obtained parental consent, not just to Club members. As in Widmar, Milford made its forum available to other organizations. The Club's activities are materially indistiguishable from those in Lamb's Chapel and Widmar. Thus, Milford's reliance on the Establishment Clause is unavailing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p26"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Milford attempts to distinguish Lamb's Chapel and Widmar by emphasizing that Milford's policy involves elementary school children. According to Milford, children will perceive that the school is endorsing the Club and will feel coercive pressure to participate, because the Club's activities take place on school grounds, even though they occur during nonschool hours.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="fn5_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; This argument is unpersuasive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p27"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;First, we have held that "a significant factor in upholding governmental programs in the face of Establishment Clause attack is their neutrality towards religion." Rosenberger, 515 U.S., at 839 (emphasis added). See also Mitchell v. Helms, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/Bc9/mitchell-v-helms/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;530&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;793&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, (2000) (slip op., at 10) (plurality opinion) ("In distinguishing between indoctrination that is attributable to the State and indoctrination that is not, [the Court has] consistently turned to the principle of neutrality, upholding aid that is offered to a broad range of groups or persons without regard to their religion" (emphasis added)); id., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) ("[N]eutrality is an important reason for upholding government-aid programs against Establishment Clause challenges"). Milford's implication that granting access to the Club would do damage to the neutrality principle defies logic. For the "guarantee of neutrality is respected, not offended, when the government, following neutral criteria and evenhanded policies, extends benefits to recipients whose ideologies and viewpoints, including religious ones, are broad and diverse." Rosenberger, supra, at 839. The Good News Club seeks nothing more than to be treated neutrally and given access to speak about the same topics as are other groups. Because allowing the Club to speak on school grounds would ensure neutrality, not threaten it, Milford faces an uphill battle in arguing that the Establishment Clause compels it to exclude the Good News Club.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p28"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Second, to the extent we consider whether the community would feel coercive pressure to engage in the Club's activities, cf. Lee v. Weisman, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zwt/lee-v-weisman/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;505&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;577&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 592-593 (1992), the relevant community would be the parents, not the elementary school children. It is the parents who choose whether their children will attend the Good News Club meetings. Because the children cannot attend without their parents' permission, they cannot be coerced into engaging in the Good News Club's religious activities. Milford does not suggest that the parents of elementary school children would be confused about whether the school was endorsing religion. Nor do we believe that such an argument could be reasonably advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p29"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Third, whatever significance we may have assigned in the Establishment Clause context to the suggestion that elementary school children are more impressionable than adults, cf., e.g., Lee, supra, at 592; School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z9v/school-dist-of-grand-rapids-v-ball/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;473&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;373&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 390 (1985) (stating that "symbolism of a union between church and state is most likely to influence children of tender years, whose experience is limited and whose beliefs consequently are the function of environment as much as of free and voluntary choice"), we have never extended our Establishment Clause jurisprudence to foreclose private religious conduct during nonschool hours merely because it takes place on school premises where elementary school children may be present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p30"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;None of the cases discussed by Milford persuades us that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence has gone this far. For example, Milford cites Lee v. Weisman for the proposition that "there are heightened concerns with protecting freedom of conscience from subtle coercive pressure in the elementary and secondary public schools," 505 U.S., at 592. In Lee, however, we concluded that attendance at the graduation exercise was obligatory. Id., at 586. See also Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/BbZ/santa-fe-independent-school-dist-v-doe/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;530&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;290&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (2000) (holding the school's policy of permitting prayer at football games unconstitutional where the activity took place during a school-sponsored event and not in a public forum). We did not place independent significance on the fact that the graduation exercise might take place on school premises, Lee, supra, at 583. Here, where the school facilities are being used for a nonschool function and there is no government sponsorship of the Club's activities, Lee is inapposite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p31"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Equally unsupportive is Edwards v. Aguillard, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;482&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;578&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1987), in which we held that a Louisiana law that proscribed the teaching of evolution as part of the public school curriculum, unless accompanied by a lesson on creationism, violated the Establishment Clause. In Edwards, we mentioned that students are susceptible to pressure in the classroom, particularly given their possible reliance on teachers as role models. See id., at 584. But we did not discuss this concern in our application of the law to the facts. Moreover, we did note that mandatory attendance requirements meant that State advancement of religion in a school would be particularly harshly felt by impressionable students.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6" id="fn6_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; But we did not suggest that, when the school was not actually advancing religion, the impressionability of students would be relevant to the Establishment Clause issue. Even if Edwards had articulated the principle Milford believes it did, the facts in Edwards are simply too remote from those here to give the principle any weight. Edwards involved the content of the curriculum taught by state teachers during the schoolday to children required to attend. Obviously, when individuals who are not schoolteachers are giving lessons after school to children permitted to attend only with parental consent, the concerns expressed in Edwards are not present.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn7" id="fn7_ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p32"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Fourth, even if we were to consider the possible misperceptions by schoolchildren in deciding whether Milford's permitting the Club's activities would violate the Establishment Clause, the facts of this case simply do not support Milford's conclusion. There is no evidence that young children are permitted to loiter outside classrooms after the schoolday has ended. Surely even young children are aware of events for which their parents must sign permission forms. The meetings were held in a combined high school resource room and middle school special education room, not in an elementary school classroom. The instructors are not schoolteachers. And the children in the group are not all the same age as in the normal classroom setting; their ages range from 6 to 12.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn8" id="fn8_ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; In sum, these circumstances simply do not support the theory that small children would perceive endorsement here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p33"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Finally, even if we were to inquire into the minds of schoolchildren in this case, we cannot say the danger that children would misperceive the endorsement of religion is any greater than the danger that they would perceive a hostility toward the religious viewpoint if the Club were excluded from the public forum. This concern is particularly acute given the reality that Milford's building is not used only for elementary school children. Students, from kindergarten through the 12th grade, all attend school in the same building. There may be as many, if not more, upperclassmen than elementary school children who occupy the school after hours. For that matter, members of the public writ large are permitted in the school after hours pursuant to the community use policy. Any bystander could conceivably be aware of the school's use policy and its exclusion of the Good News Club, and could suffer as much from viewpoint discrimination as elementary school children could suffer from perceived endorsement. Cf. Rosenberger, 515 U.S., at 835-836 (expressing the concern that viewpoint discrimination can chill individual thought and expression).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p34"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We cannot operate, as Milford would have us do, under the assumption that any risk that small children would perceive endorsement should counsel in favor of excluding the Club's religious activity. We decline to employ Establishment Clause jurisprudence using a modified heckler's veto, in which a group's religious activity can be proscribed on the basis of what the youngest members of the audience might misperceive. Cf. Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B4U/capitol-squarereview-and-advisory-bd-v-pinette/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;515&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;753&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 779-780 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("[B]ecause our concern is with the political community writ large, the endorsement inquiry is not about the perceptions of particular individuals or saving isolated nonadherents from ... discomfort ... . It is for this reason that the reasonable observer in the endorsement inquiry must be deemed aware of the history and context of the community and forum in which the religious [speech takes place]" (emphasis added)). There are countervailing constitutional concerns related to rights of other individuals in the community. In this case, those countervailing concerns are the free speech rights of the Club and its members. Cf. Rosenberger, supra, at 835 ("Vital First Amendment speech principles are at stake here"). And, we have already found that those rights have been violated, not merely perceived to have been violated, by the school's actions toward the Club.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p35"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We are not convinced that there is any significance in this case to the possibility that elementary school children may witness the Good News Club's activities on school premises, and therefore we can find no reason to depart from our holdings in Lamb's Chapel and Widmar. Accordingly, we conclude that permitting the Club to meet on the school's premises would not have violated the Establishment Clause.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn9" id="fn9_ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="num" id="p36"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;36&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When Milford denied the Good News Club access to the school's limited public forum on the ground that the Club was religious in nature, it discriminated against the Club because of its religious viewpoint in violation of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. Because Milford has not raised a valid Establishment Clause claim, we do not address the question whether such a claim could excuse Milford's viewpoint discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; The District Court dismissed the Club's claim under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act because we held the Act to be unconstitutional in City of Boerne v. Flores, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B7U/city-of-boerne-v-flores/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;521&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;507&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1997).

Supp. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;147&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 150, n. 4 (NDNY 1998).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; Although Milford argued below that, under 414, it could not permit its property to be used for the purpose of religious activity, see Brief for Appellee in No. 98-9494 (CA2), p. 12, here it merely asserts in one sentence that it has, "in accordance with state law, closed [its] limited open forum to purely religious instruction and services," Brief for Respondent 27. Because Milford does not elaborate, it is difficult to discern whether it is arguing that it is required by state law to exclude the Club's activities.   Before the Court of Appeals, Milford cited Trietley v. Board of Ed. of Buffalo, 65 App. Div. 2d 1, 409 N. Y. S. 2d 912 (1978), in which a New York court held that a local school district could not permit a student Bible club to meet on school property because "[r]eligious purposes are not included in the enumerated purposes for which a school may be used under section 414 of the Education Law." Id., at 5-6, 409 N. Y. S. 2d, at 915. Although the court conceded that the Bible clubs might provide incidental secular benefits, it nonetheless concluded that the school would have violated the Establishment Clause had it permitted the club's activities on campus. Because we hold that the exclusion of the Club on the basis of its religious perspective constitutes unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination, it is no defense for Milford that purely religious purposes can be excluded under state law.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn3"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; We find it remarkable that the Court of Appeals majority did not cite Lamb's Chapel, despite its obvious relevance to the case. We do not necessarily expect a court of appeals to catalog every opinion that reverses one of its precedents. Nonetheless, this oversight is particularly incredible because the majority's attention was directed to it at every turn. See, e.g., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca2/4W9w/the-good-news-club-andrea-fournier-and-darleen-fou/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;202&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;502&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 513 (CA2 2000) (Jacobs, J., dissenting) ("I cannot square the majority's analysis in this case with Lamb's Chapel"); 21 F. Supp. 2d, at 150; App. O9-O11 (District Court stating "that Lamb's Chapel and Rosenberger pinpoint the critical issue in this case"); Brief for Appellee in No. 98-9494 (CA2) at 36-39; Brief for Appellants in No. 98-9494 (CA2), pp. 15, 36.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn4"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Despite Milford's insistence that the Club's activities constitute "religious worship," the Court of Appeals made no such determination. It did compare the Club's activities to "religious worship," 202 F.3d, at 510, but ultimately it concluded merely that the Club's activities "fall outside the bounds of pure 'moral and character development,' " id., at 511. In any event, we conclude that the Club's activities do not constitute mere religious worship, divorced from any teaching of moral values. Justice Souter's recitation of the Club's activities is accurate. See post, at 4-5 (opinion of Souter, J.). But in our view, religion is used by the Club in the same fashion that it was used by Lamb's Chapel and by the students in Rosenberger: religion is the viewpoint from which ideas are conveyed. We did not find the Rosenberger students' attempt to cultivate a personal relationship with Christ to bar their claim that religion was a viewpoint. And we see no reason to treat the Club's use of religion as something other than a viewpoint merely because of any evangelical message it conveys.   According to Justice Souter, the Club's activities constitute "an evangelical service of worship." Post, at 5. Regardless of the label Justice Souter wishes to use, what matters is the substance of the Club's activities, which we conclude are materially indistinguishable from the activities in Lamb's Chapel and Rosenberger.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn5"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; It is worth noting that, although Milford repeatedly has argued that the Club's meeting time directly after the schoolday is relevant to its Establishment Clause concerns, the record does not reflect any offer by the school district to permit the Club to use the facilities at a different time of day. The superintendent's stated reason for denying the applications was simply that the Club's activities were "religious instruction." 202 F.3d, at 507. In any event, consistent with Lamb's Chapel and Widmar, the school could not deny equal access to the Club for any time that is generally available for public use.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn6"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Milford also cites Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Ed. of School Dist. No. 71, Champaign Cty., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x55/illinois-ex-rel-mccollum-v-board-of-ed-of-school-d/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;333&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;203&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1948), for its position that the Club's religious element would be advanced by the State through compulsory attendance laws. In McCollum, the school district excused students from their normal classroom study during the regular schoolday to attend classes taught by sectarian religious teachers, who were subject to approval by the school superintendent. Under these circumstances, this Court found it relevant that "[t]he operation of the State's compulsory education system ... assist[ed] and [wa]s integrated with the program of religious instruction carried on by separate religious sects." Id., at 209. In the present case, there is simply no integration and cooperation between the school district and the Club. The Club's activities take place after the time when the children are compelled by state law to be at the school.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn7"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn7_ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Milford also refers to Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zqP/board-of-ed-of-westside-community-schools-dist-66-/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;496&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;226&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1990), to support its view that "assumptions about the ability of students to make ... subtle distinctions [between schoolteachers during the schoolday and Reverend Fournier after school] are less valid for elementary age children who tend to be less informed, more impressionable, and more subject to peer pressure than average adults." Brief for Respondent 19. Four Justices in Mergens believed that high school students likely are capable of distinguishing between government and private endorsement of religion. See 496 U.S., at 250-251 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). The opinion, however, made no statement about how capable of discerning endorsement elementary school children would have been in the context of Mergens, where the activity at issue was after school. In any event, even to the extent elementary school children are more prone to peer pressure than are older children, it simply is not clear what, in this case, they could be pressured to do.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In further support of the argument that the impressionability of elementary school children even after school is significant, Milford points to several cases in which we have found Establishment Clause violations in public schools. For example, Milford relies heavily on School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xGW/abington-school-dist-v-schempp/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;374&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;203&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1963), in which we found unconstitutional Pennsylvania's practice of permitting public schools to read Bible verses at the opening of each schoolday. Schempp, however, is inapposite because this case does not involve activity by the school during the schoolday.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn8"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn8_ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Milford also relies on the Equal Access Act, 98 Stat. 1302, 20 U.S.C.  4071-4074, as evidence that Congress has recognized the vulnerability of elementary school children to misperceiving endorsement of religion. The Act, however, makes no express recognition of the impressionability of elementary school children. It applies only to public secondary schools and makes no mention of elementary schools. 4071(a). We can derive no meaning from the choice by Congress not to address elementary schools.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn9"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn9_ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Both parties have briefed the Establishment Clause issue extensively, and neither suggests that a remand would be of assistance on this issue. Although Justice Souter would prefer that a record be developed on several facts, see post, at 7, and Justice Breyer believes that development of those facts could yet be dispositive in this case, see post, at 2, none of these facts is relevant to the Establishment Clause inquiry. For example, Justice Souter suggests that we cannot determine whether there would be an Establishment Clause violation unless we know when, and to what extent, other groups use the facilities. When a limited public forum is available for use by groups presenting any viewpoint, however, we would not find an Establishment Clause violation simply because only groups presenting a religious viewpoint have opted to take advantage of the forum at a particular time.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p44"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;44&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Justice Scalia, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;45&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I join the Court's opinion but write separately to explain further my views on two issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p46"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;46&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;* First, I join Part IV of the Court's opinion, regarding the Establishment Clause issue, with the understanding that its consideration of coercive pressure, see ante, at 14, and perceptions of endorsement, see ante, at 14-15, 17-18, "to the extent" that the law makes such factors relevant, is consistent with the belief (which I hold) that in this case that extent is zero. As to coercive pressure: Physical coercion is not at issue here; and so-called "peer pressure," if it can even been considered coercion, is, when it arises from private activities, one of the attendant consequences of a freedom of association that is constitutionally protected, see, e.g., Roberts v. United States Jaycees, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z5c/roberts-v-united-states-jaycees/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;468&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;609&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 622 (1984); NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xrd/naacp-v-alabama-ex-rel-patterson/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;357&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;449&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 460-461 (1958). What is at play here is not coercion, but the compulsion of ideas-and the private right to exert and receive that compulsion (or to have one's children receive it) is protected by the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses, see, e.g., Heffron v. International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yRJ/heffron-v-international-soc-for-krishna-consciousn/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;452&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;640&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 647 (1981); Murdock v. Pennsylvania, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wSc/murdock-v-pennsylvania/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;319&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;105&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 108-109 (1943); Cantwell v. Connecticut, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wHZ/cantwell-v-connecticut/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;310&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;296&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 307-310 (1940), not banned by the Establishment Clause. A priest has as much liberty to proselytize as a patriot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p47"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;47&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As to endorsement, I have previously written that "[r]eligious expression cannot violate the Establishment Clause where it (1) is purely private and (2) occurs in a traditional or designated public forum, publicly announced and open to all on equal terms." Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B4U/capitol-squarereview-and-advisory-bd-v-pinette/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;515&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;753&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 770 (1995). The same is true of private speech that occurs in a limited public forum, publicly announced, whose boundaries are not drawn to favor religious groups but instead permit a cross-section of uses. In that context, which is this case, "erroneous conclusions [about endorsement] do not count." Id., at 765. See also Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zy7/lambs-chapel-v-center-moriches-union-free-school-d/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;508&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;384&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 401 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) ("I would hold, simply and clearly, that giving [a private religious group] nondiscriminatory access to school facilities cannot violate [the Establishment Clause] because it does not signify state or local embrace of a particular religious sect").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;II&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p48"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;48&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Second, since we have rejected the only reason that respondent gave for excluding the Club's speech from a forum that clearly included it (the forum was opened to any "us[e] pertaining to the welfare of the community," App. to Pet. for Cert. D1), I do not suppose it matters whether the exclusion is characterized as viewpoint or subject-matter discrimination. Lacking any legitimate reason for excluding the Club's speech from its forum-"because it's religious" will not do, see, e.g., Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zye/church-of-lukumi-babalu-aye-inc-v-hialeah/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;508&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;520&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 532-533, 546 (1993); Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zq1/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-sm/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;494&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;872&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 877-878 (1990)-respondent would seem to fail First Amendment scrutiny regardless of how its action is characterized. Even subject-matter limits must at least be "reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum," Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp;amp; Ed. Fund, Inc., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z9H/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;473&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;788&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 806 (1985).&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1-1" id="fn1-1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; But I agree, in any event, that respondent did discriminate on the basis of viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p49"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;49&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As I understand it, the point of disagreement between the Court and the dissenters (and the Court of Appeals) with regard to petitioner's Free Speech Clause claim is not whether the Good News Club must be permitted to present religious viewpoints on morals and character in respondent's forum, which has been opened to secular discussions of that subject, see ante, at 7-8.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2-1" id="fn2-1_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; The answer to that is established by our decision in Lamb's Chapel, supra. The point of disagreement is not even whether some of the Club's religious speech fell within the protection of Lamb's Chapel. It certainly did.

      &lt;p&gt;The disagreement, rather, regards the portions of the Club's meetings that are not "purely" "discussions" of morality and character from a religious viewpoint. The Club, for example, urges children "who already believe in the Lord Jesus as their Savior" to "[s]top and ask God for the strength and the 'want' ... to obey Him," 21 F. Supp.2d 147, 156 (NDNY 1998) (internal quotation marks omitted), and it invites children who "don't know Jesus as Savior" to "trust the Lord Jesus to be [their] Savior from sin," ibid. The dissenters and the Second Circuit say that the presence of such additional speech, because it is purely religious, transforms the Club's meetings into something different in kind from other, nonreligious activities that teach moral and character development. See post, at 4-5 (Stevens, J., dissenting); post, at 4-5 (Souter, J., dissenting); 202 F.3d, at 509-511. Therefore, the argument goes, excluding the Club is not viewpoint discrimination. I disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;51&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Respondent has opened its facilities to any "us[e] pertaining to the welfare of the community, provided that such us[e] shall be nonexclusive and shall be opened to the general public." App. to Pet. for Cert. D1. Shaping the moral and character development of children certainly "pertain[s] to the welfare of the community." Thus, respondent has agreed that groups engaged in the endeavor of developing character may use its forum. The Boy Scouts, for example, may seek "to influence a boy's character, development and spiritual growth," App. N10-N11; cf. Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/Bc7/boy-scouts-of-america-v-dale/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;530&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;640&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 649 (2000) ("[T]he general mission of the Boy Scouts is clear: '[t]o instill values in young people' " (quoting the Scouts' mission statement)), and a group may use Aesop's Fables to teach moral values, App. N11. When the Club attempted to teach Biblical-based moral values, however, it was excluded because its activities "d[id] not involve merely a religious perspective on the secular subject of morality" and because "it [was] clear from the conduct of the meetings that the Good News Club goes far beyond merely stating its viewpoint." 202 F.3d, at 510.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p52"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;52&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;From no other group does respondent require the sterility of speech that it demands of petitioners. The Boy Scouts could undoubtedly buttress their exhortations to keep "morally straight" and live "clean" lives, see Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, supra, at 649, by giving reasons why that is a good idea-because parents want and expect it, because it will make the scouts "better" and "more successful" people, because it will emulate such admired past Scouts as former President Gerald Ford. The Club, however, may only discuss morals and character, and cannot give its reasons why they should be fostered-because God wants and expects it, because it will make the Club members "saintly" people, and because it emulates Jesus Christ. The Club may not, in other words, independently discuss the religious premise on which its views are based-that God exists and His assistance is necessary to morality. It may not defend the premise, and it absolutely must not seek to persuade the children that the premise is true. The children must, so to say, take it on faith. This is blatant viewpoint discrimination. Just as calls to character based on patriotism will go unanswered if the listeners do not believe their country is good and just, calls to moral behavior based on God's will are useless if the listeners do not believe that God exists. Effectiveness in presenting a viewpoint rests on the persuasiveness with which the speaker defends his premise-and in respondent's facilities every premise but a religious one may be defended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p53"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B4V/rosenberger-v-rector-and-visitors-of-univ-of-va/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;515&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;819&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1995), we struck down a similar viewpoint restriction. There, a private student newspaper sought funding from a student-activity fund on the same basis as its secular counterparts. And though the paper printed such directly religious material as exhortations to belief, see id., at 826 (quoting the paper's self-described mission " 'to encourage students to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means' "); id., at 865 (Souter, J., dissenting) (" 'The only way to salvation through Him is by confessing and repenting of sin. It is the Christian's duty to make sinners aware of their need for salvation' " (quoting the paper)); see also id., at 865-867 (quoting other examples), we held that refusing to provide the funds discriminated on the basis of viewpoint, because the religious speech had been used to "provid[e] ... a specific premise ... from which a variety of subjects may be discussed and considered," id., at 831 (opinion of the Court). The right to present a viewpoint based on a religion premise carried with it the right to defend the premise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p54"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;54&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The dissenters emphasize that the religious speech used by the Club as the foundation for its views on morals and character is not just any type of religious speech-although they cannot agree exactly what type of religious speech it is. In Justice Stevens' view, it is speech "aimed principally at proselytizing or inculcating belief in a particular religious faith," post, at 1; see also post, at 5, n. 3. This does not, to begin with, distinguish Rosenberger, which also involved proselytizing speech, as the above quotations show. See also Rosenberger, supra, at 844 (referring approvingly to the dissent's description of the paper as a "wor[k] characterized by ... evangelism"). But in addition, it does not distinguish the Club's activities from those of the other groups using respondent's forum-which have not, as Justice Stevens suggests, see post, at 2-3, been restricted to roundtable "discussions" of moral issues. Those groups may seek to inculcate children with their beliefs, and they may furthermore "recruit others to join their respective groups," post, at 3. The Club must therefore have liberty to do the same, even if, as Justice Stevens fears without support in the record, see post, at 3, its actions may prove (shudder!) divisive. See Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S., at 395 (remarking that worries about "public unrest" caused by "proselytizing" are "difficult to defend as a reason to deny the presentation of a religious point of view"); cf. Lynch v. Donnelly, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z2K/lynch-v-donnelly/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;465&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;668&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 684-685 (1984) (holding that "political divisiveness" could not invalidate inclusion of crche in municipal Christmas display); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S., at 310-311.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p55"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;55&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Justice Souter, while agreeing that the Club's religious speech "may be characterized as proselytizing," post, at 5, n. 3, thinks that it is even more clearly excludable from respondent's forum because it is essentially "an evangelical service of worship," post, at 5. But we have previously rejected the attempt to distinguish worship from other religious speech, saying that "the distinction has [no] intelligible content," and further, no "relevance" to the constitutional issue. Widmar v. Vincent, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ySF/widmar-v-vincent/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;454&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;263&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 269, n. 6 (1981); see also Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S., at 109 (refusing to distinguish evangelism from worship).&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3-1" id="fn3-1_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; Those holdings are surely proved correct today by the dissenters' inability to agree, even between themselves, into which subcategory of religious speech the Club's activities fell. If the distinction did have content, it would be beyond the courts' competence to administer. Widmar v. Vincent, supra, at 269, n. 6; cf. Lee v. Weisman, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zwt/lee-v-weisman/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;505&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;577&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 616-617 (1992) (Souter, J., concurring) ("I can hardly imagine a subject less amenable to the competence of the federal judiciary, or more deliberately to be avoided where possible," than "comparative theology"). And if courts (and other government officials) were competent, applying the distinction would require state monitoring of private, religious speech with a degree of pervasiveness that we have previously found unacceptable. See, e.g., Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., supra, at 844-845; Widmar v. Vincent, supra, at 269, n. 6. I will not endorse an approach that suffers such a wondrous diversity of flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;With these words of explanation, I join the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1-1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; In this regard, I should note the inaccuracy of the Justice Souter's claim that the reasonableness of the forum limitation is not properly before us, see post, at 2-3, and n. 1 (dissenting opinion). Petitioners argued, both in their papers filed in the District Court, Memorandum of Law in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment in No. 97-CV-0302 (NDNY), pp. 20-22, and in their brief filed on appeal, Brief for Appellants in No. 98-9494 (CA2), pp. 33-35, that respondent's exclusion of them from the forum was unreasonable in light of the purposes served by the forum. Although the District Court did say in passing that the reasonableness of respondent's general restriction on use of its facilities for religious purposes was not challenged, see 21 F. Supp.2d 147, 154 (NDNY 1998), the Court of Appeals apparently decided that the particular reasonableness challenge brought by petitioners had been preserved, because it addressed the argument on the merits, see &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca2/4W9w/the-good-news-club-andrea-fournier-and-darleen-fou/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;202&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;502&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 509 (CA2 2000) ("Taking first the reasonableness criterion, the Club argues that the restriction is unreasonable ... . This argument is foreclosed by precedent").&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn2-1"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2-1_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Neither does the disagreement center on the mode of the Club's speech-the fact that it sings songs and plays games. Although a forum could perhaps be opened to lectures but not plays, debates but not concerts, respondent has placed no such restrictions on the use of its facilities. See App. N8, N14, N19 (allowing seminars, concerts, and plays).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn3-1"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3-1_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; We have drawn a different distinction-between religious speech generally and speech about religion-but only with regard to restrictions the State must place on its own speech, where pervasive state monitoring is unproblematic. See School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xGW/abington-school-dist-v-schempp/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;374&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;203&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 225 (1963) (State schools in their official capacity may not teach religion but may teach about religion). Whatever the rule there, licensing and monitoring private religious speech is an entirely different matter, see, e.g., Kunz v. New York, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xaD/kunz-v-new-york/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;340&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;290&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 293-294 (1951), even in a limited public forum where the state has some authority to draw subject-matter distinctions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p58"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;58&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Justice Breyer, concurring in part.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p59"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;59&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I agree with the Court's conclusion and join its opinion to the extent that they are consistent with the following three observations. First, the government's "neutrality" in respect to religion is one, but only one, of the considerations relevant to deciding whether a public school's policy violates the Establishment Clause. See, e.g., Mitchell v. Helms, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/Bc9/mitchell-v-helms/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;530&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;793&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 839 (2000) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B4U/capitol-squarereview-and-advisory-bd-v-pinette/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;515&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;753&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 774, 777 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). As this Court previously has indicated, a child's perception that the school has endorsed a particular religion or religion in general may also prove critically important. See School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z9v/school-dist-of-grand-rapids-v-ball/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;473&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;373&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 389-390 (1985); see also Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zy7/lambs-chapel-v-center-moriches-union-free-school-d/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;508&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;384&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 395 (1993); County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zoK/allegheny-county-v-greater-pittsburgh-aclu/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;492&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;573&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 592-594 (1989). Today's opinion does not purport to change that legal principle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p60"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Second, the critical Establishment Clause question here may well prove to be whether a child, participating in the Good News Club's activities, could reasonably perceive the school's permission for the club to use its facilities as an endorsement of religion. See Ball, supra, at 390 ("[A]n important concern of the effects test is whether ... the challenged government action is sufficiently likely to be perceived by adherents of the controlling denominations as an endorsement, and by the nonadherents as a disapproval, of their individual religious choices"). The time of day, the age of the children, the nature of the meetings, and other specific circumstances are relevant in helping to determine whether, in fact, the Club "so dominate[s]" the "forum" that, in the children's minds, "a formal policy of equal access is transformed into a demonstration of approval." Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd., supra, at 777 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p61"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;61&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Third, the Court cannot fully answer the Establishment Clause question this case raises, given its procedural posture. The specific legal action that brought this case to the Court of Appeals was the District Court's decision to grant Milford Central School's motion for summary judgment. The Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment. We now hold that the school was not entitled to summary judgment, either in respect to the Free Speech or the Establishment Clause issue. Our holding must mean that, viewing the disputed facts (including facts about the children's perceptions) favorably to the Club (the non moving party), the s chool has not shown an Establishment Clause violation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p62"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;62&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To deny one party's motion for summary judgment, however, is not to grant summary judgment for the other side. There may be disputed "genuine issue[s]" of "material fact," Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c), particularly about how a reasonable child participant would understand the school's role, cf. post, at 7 (Souter, J., dissenting). Indeed, the Court itself points to facts not in evidence, ante, at 17 ("There is no evidence that young children are permitted to loiter outside classrooms after the schoolday has ended"), ante, at 18 ("There may be as many, if not more, upperclassmen than elementary school children who occupy the school after hours"), identifies facts in evidence which may, depending on other facts not in evidence, be of legal significance, ante, at 17 (discussing the type of room in which the meetings were held and noting that the Club's participants "are not all the same age as in the normal classroom setting"), and makes assumptions about other facts, ibid. ("Surely even young children are aware of events for which their parents must sign permission forms"), ante, at 18 ("Any bystander could conceivably be aware of the school's use policy and its exclusion of the Good News Club, and could suffer as much from viewpoint discrimination as elementary school children could suffer from perceived endorsement"). The Court's invocation of what is missing from the record and its assumptions about what is present in the record only confirm that both parties, if they so desire, should have a fair opportunity to fill the evidentiary gap in light of today's opinion. Cf. Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 56(c) (summary judgment appropriate only where there is "no genuine issue as to any material fact" and movant "is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law"), 56(f) (permitting supplementation of record for summary judgment purposes where appropriate).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p63"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;63&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Justice Stevens, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p64"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Milford Central School has invited the public to use its facilities for educational and recreational purposes, but not for "religious purposes." Speech for "religious purposes" may reasonably be understood to encompass three different categories. First, there is religious speech that is simply speech about a particular topic from a religious point of view. The film in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zy7/lambs-chapel-v-center-moriches-union-free-school-d/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;508&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;384&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1993), illustrates this category. See id., at 388 (observing that the film series at issue in that case "would discuss Dr. [James] Dobson's views on the undermining influences of the media that could only be counterbalanced by returning to traditional, Christian family values instilled at an early stage").  Second, there is religious speech that amounts to worship, or its equivalent. Our decision in Widmar v. Vincent, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ySF/widmar-v-vincent/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;454&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;263&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1981), concerned such speech. See id., at 264-265 (describing the speech in question as involving "religious worship"). Third, there is an intermediate category that is aimed principally at proselytizing or inculcating belief in a particular religious faith.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p65"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;65&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A public entity may not generally exclude even religious worship from an open public forum. Id., at 276. Similarly, a public entity that creates a limited public forum for the discussion of certain specified topics may not exclude a speaker simply because she approaches those topics from a religious point of view. Thus, in Lamb's Chapel we held that a public school that permitted its facilities to be used for the discussion of family issues and child rearing could not deny access to speakers presenting a religious point of view on those issues. See Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S., at 393-394.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p66"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;66&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But, while a public entity may not censor speech about an authorized topic based on the point of view expressed by the speaker, it has broad discretion to "preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated." Greer v. Spock, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ywj/greer-v-spock/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;424&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;828&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 836 (1976); see also Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zqP/board-of-ed-of-westside-community-schools-dist-66-/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;496&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;226&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 275, n. 6 (1990) (Stevens, J., dissenting) ("A school's extracurricular activities constitute a part of the school's teaching mission, and the school accordingly must make 'decisions concerning the content of those activities' " (quoting Widmar, 454 U.S., at 278 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment)). Accordingly, "control over access to a nonpublic forum can be based on subject matter and speaker identity so long as the distinctions drawn are reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum and are viewpoint neutral." Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp;amp; Ed. Fund, Inc., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/z9H/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;473&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;788&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 806 (1985). The novel question that this case presents concerns the constitutionality of a public school's attempt to limit the scope of a public forum it has created. More specifically, the question is whether a school can, consistently with the First Amendment, create a limited public forum that admits the first type of religious speech without allowing the other two.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p67"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;67&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Distinguishing speech from a religious viewpoint, on the one hand, from religious proselytizing, on the other, is comparable to distinguishing meetings to discuss political issues from meetings whose principal purpose is to recruit new members to join a political organization. If a school decides to authorize after school discussions of current events in its classrooms, it may not exclude people from expressing their views simply because it dislikes their particular political opinions. But must it therefore allow organized political groups-for example, the Democratic Party, the Libertarian Party, or the Ku Klux Klan-to hold meetings, the principal purpose of which is not to discuss the current-events topic from their own unique point of view but rather to recruit others to join their respective groups? I think not. Such recruiting meetings may introduce divisiveness and tend to separate young children into cliques that undermine the school's educational mission. Cf. Lehman v. Shaker Heights, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yqS/lehman-v-shaker-heights/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;418&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;298&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1974) (upholding a city's refusal to allow "political advertising" on public transportation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p68"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;68&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;School officials may reasonably believe that evangelical meetings designed to convert children to a particular religious faith pose the same risk. And, just as a school may allow meetings to discuss current events from a political perspective without also allowing organized political recruitment, so too can a school allow discussion of topics such as moral development from a religious (or nonreligious) perspective without thereby opening its forum to religious proselytizing or worship. See, e.g., Campbell v. St. Tammany Parish School Board, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca5/4Xcx/sally-campbell-louisiana-christian-coalition-v-st-/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;231&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;937&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 942 (CA5 2000) ("Under the Supreme Court's jurisprudence, a government entity such as a school board has the opportunity to open its facilities to activity protected by the First Amendment, without inviting political or religious activities presented in a form that would disserve its efforts to maintain neutrality"). Moreover, any doubt on a question such as this should be resolved in a way that minimizes "intrusion by the Federal Government into the operation of our public schools," Mergens, 496 U.S., at 290 (Stevens, J., dissenting); see also Epperson v. Arkansas, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/y3v/epperson-v-arkansas/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;393&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;97&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 104 (1968) ("Judicial interposition in the operation of the public school system of the Nation raises problems requiring care and restraint... . By and large, public education in our Nation is committed to the control of state and local authorities").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p69"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;69&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The particular limitation of the forum at issue in this case is one that prohibits the use of the school's facilities for "religious purposes." It is clear that, by "religious purposes," the school district did not intend to exclude all speech from a religious point of view. See App. N13-N15 (testimony of the superintendent for Milford schools indicating that the policy would permit people to teach "that man was created by God as described in the Book of Genesis" and that crime was caused by society's "lack of faith in God"). Instead, it sought only to exclude religious speech whose principal goal is to "promote the gospel." App. N18. In other words, the school sought to allow the first type of religious speech while excluding the second and third types. As long as this is done in an even handed manner, I see no constitutional violation in such an effort.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1-2" id="fn1-2_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; The line between the various categories of religious speech may be difficult to draw, but I think that the distinctions are valid, and that a school, particularly an elementary school, must be permitted to draw them.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2-2" id="fn2-2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; Cf. Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Ed. of School Dist. No. 71, Champaign Cty., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x55/illinois-ex-rel-mccollum-v-board-of-ed-of-school-d/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;333&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;203&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 231 (1948) (Frankfurter, J., concurring) ("In no activity of the State is it more vital to keep out divisive forces than in its schools ...").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p70"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;70&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This case is undoubtedly close. Nonetheless, regardless of whether the Good News Club's activities amount to "worship," it does seem clear, based on the facts in the record, that the school district correctly classified those activities as falling within the third category of religious speech and therefore beyond the scope of the school's limited public forum.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3-2" id="fn3-2_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; In short, I am persuaded that the school district could (and did) permissibly exclude from its limited public forum proselytizing religious speech that does not rise to the level of actual worship. I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p71"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;71&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Even if I agreed with Part II of the majority opinion, however, I would not reach out, as it does in Part IV, to decide a constitutional question that was not addressed by either the District Court or the Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p72"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;72&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1-2_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The school district, for example, could not, consistently with its present policy, allow school facilities to be used by a group that affirmatively attempted to inculcate nonbelief in God or in the view that morality is wholly unrelated to belief in God. Nothing in the record, however, indicates that any such group was allowed to use school facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn2-2"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2-2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn3-2"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3-2_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The majority elides the distinction between religious speech on a particular topic and religious speech that seeks primarily to inculcate belief. Thus, it relies on Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B4V/rosenberger-v-rector-and-visitors-of-univ-of-va/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;515&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;819&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1995), as if that case involved precisely the same type of speech that is at issue here. But, while both Wide Awake, the organization in Rosenberger, and the Good News Club engage in a mixture of different types of religious speech, the Rosenberger Court clearly believed that the first type of religious speech predominated in Wide Awake. It described that group's publications as follows: "The first issue had articles about racism, crisis pregnancy, stress, prayer, C.S. Lewis' ideas about evil and free will, and reviews of religious music. In the next two issues, Wide Awake featured stories about homosexuality, Christian missionary work, and eating disorders, as well as music reviews and interviews with University professors." Id., at 826. In contrast to Wide Awake's emphasis on providing Christian commentary on such a diverse array of topics, Good News Club meetings are dominated by religious exhortation, see post, at 4-5 (Souter, J., dissenting). My position is therefore consistent with the Court's decision in Rosenberger.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p73"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;73&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p74"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;74&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The majority rules on two issues. First, it decides that the Court of Appeals failed to apply the rule in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zy7/lambs-chapel-v-center-moriches-union-free-school-d/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;508&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;384&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1993), which held that the government may not discriminate on the basis of viewpoint in operating a limited public forum. The majority applies that rule and concludes that Milford violated Lamb's Chapel in denying Good News the use of the school. The majority then goes on to determine that it would not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment for the Milford School District to allow the Good News Club to hold its intended gatherings of public school children in Milford's elementary school. The majority is mistaken on both points. The Court of Appeals unmistakably distinguished this case from Lamb's Chapel, though not by name, and accordingly affirmed the application of a policy, unchallenged in the District Court, that Milford's public schools may not be used for religious purposes. As for the applicability of the Establishment Clause to the Good News Club's intended use of Milford's school, the majority commits error even in reaching the issue, which was addressed neither by the Court of Appeals nor by the District Court. I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p75"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;75&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;* Lamb's Chapel, a case that arose (as this one does) from application of N. Y. Educ. Law 414 (McKinney 2000) and local policy implementing it, built on the accepted rule that a government body may designate a public forum subject to a reasonable limitation on the scope of permitted subject matter and activity, so long as the government does not use the forum-defining restrictions to deny expression to a particular viewpoint on subjects open to discussion. Specifically, Lamb's Chapel held that the government could not "permit school property to be used for the presentation of all views about family issues and child rearing except those dealing with the subject matter from a religious standpoint." 508 U.S., at 393-394.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p76"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;76&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This case, like Lamb's Chapel, properly raises no issue about the reasonableness of Milford's criteria for restricting the scope of its designated public forum. Milford has opened school property for, among other things, "instruction in any branch of education, learning or the arts" and for "social, civic and recreational meetings and entertainment events and other uses pertaining to the welfare of the community, provided that such uses shall be nonexclusive and shall be opened to the general public." App. to Pet. for Cert. D1-D3. But Milford has done this subject to the restriction that "[s]chool premises shall not be used ... for religious purposes." Id., at D2. As the District Court stated, Good News did "not object to the reasonableness of [Milford]'s policy that prohibits the use of [its] facilities for religious purposes." Id., at C14.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p77"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;77&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The sole question before the District Court was, therefore, whether, in refusing to allow Good News's intended use, Milford was misapplying its unchallenged restriction in a way that amounted to imposing a viewpoint-based restriction on what could be said or done by a group entitled to use the forum for an educational, civic, or other permitted purpose. The question was whether Good News was being disqualified when it merely sought to use the school property the same way that the Milford Boy and Girl Scouts and the 4-H Club did. The District Court held on the basis of undisputed facts that Good News's activity was essentially unlike the presentation of views on secular issues from a religious standpoint held to be protected in Lamb's Chapel, see App. to Pet. for Cert. C29-C31, and was instead activity precluded by Milford's unchallenged policy against religious use, even under the narrowest definition of that term.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p78"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;78&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals understood the issue the same way. See &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca2/4W9w/the-good-news-club-andrea-fournier-and-darleen-fou/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;202&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;502&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 508 (CA2 2000) (Good News argues that "to exclude the Club because it teaches morals and values from a Christian perspective constitutes unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination"); id., at 509 ("The crux of the Good News Club's argument is that the Milford school's application of the Community Use Policy to exclude the Club from its facilities is not viewpoint neutral").&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1-3" id="fn1-3_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; The Court of Appeals also realized that the Lamb's Chapel criterion was the appropriate measure: "The activities of the Good News Club do not involve merely a religious perspective on the secular subject of morality." 202 F.3d, at 510. Cf. Lamb's Chapel, supra, at 393 (district could not exclude "religious standpoint" in discussion on childrearing and family values, an undisputed "use for social or civic purposes otherwise permitted" under the use policy).&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2-3" id="fn2-3_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; The appeals court agreed with the District Court that the undisputed facts in this case differ from those in Lamb's Chapel, as night from day. A sampling of those facts shows why both courts were correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p79"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;79&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Good News's classes open and close with prayer. In a sample lesson considered by the District Court, children are instructed that "[t]he Bible tells us how we can have our sins forgiven by receiving the Lord Jesus Christ. It tells us how to live to please Him... . If you have received the Lord Jesus as your Saviour from sin, you belong to God's special group-His family." App. to Pet. for Cert. C17-C18 (ellipsis in original). The lesson plan instructs the teacher to "lead a child to Christ," and, when reading a Bible verse, to "[e]mphasize that this verse is from the Bible, God's Word" and is "important-and true-because God said it." The lesson further exhorts the teacher to "[b]e sure to give an opportunity for the 'unsaved' children in your class to respond to the Gospel" and cautions against "neglect[ing] this responsibility." Id., at C20.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p80"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While Good News's program utilizes songs and games, the heart of the meeting is the "challenge" and "invitation," which are repeated at various times throughout the lesson. During the challenge, "saved" children who "already believe in the Lord Jesus as their Savior" are challenged to " 'stop and ask God for the strength and the "want" . . . to obey Him.' " Ibid. They are instructed that "[i]f you know Jesus as your Savior, you need to place God first in your life. And if you don't know Jesus as Savior and if you would like to, then we will-we will pray with you separately, individually... . And the challenge would be, those of you who know Jesus as Savior, you can rely on God's strength to obey Him." Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p81"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;81&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;During the invitation, the teacher "invites" the "unsaved" children " 'to trust the Lord Jesus to be your Savior from sin,' " and " 'receiv[e] [him] as your Savior from sin.' " Id., at C21. The children are then instructed that "[i]f you believe what God's Word says about your sin and how Jesus died and rose again for you, you can have His forever life today. Please bow your heads and close your eyes. If you have never believed on the Lord Jesus as your Savior and would like to do that, please show me by raising your hand. If you raised your hand to show me you want to believe on the Lord Jesus, please meet me so I can show you from God's Word how you can receive His everlasting life." Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p82"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;82&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is beyond question that Good News intends to use the public school premises not for the mere discussion of a subject from a particular, Christian point of view, but for an evangelical service of worship calling children to commit themselves in an act of Christian conversion.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3-3" id="fn3-3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; The majority avoids this reality only by resorting to the bland and general characterization of Good News's activity as "teaching of morals and character, from a religious standpoint." See ante, at 9. If the majority's statement ignores reality, as it surely does, then today's holding may be understood only in equally generic terms. Otherwise, indeed, this case would stand for the remarkable proposition that any public school opened for civic meetings must be opened for use as a church, synagogue, or mosque.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;II&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p83"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;83&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I also respectfully dissent from the majority's refusal to remand on all other issues, insisting instead on acting as a court of first instance in reviewing Milford's claim that it would violate the Establishment Clause to grant Good News's application. Milford raised this claim to demonstrate a compelling interest for saying no to Good News, even on the erroneous assumption that Lamb's Chapel's public forum analysis would otherwise require Milford to say yes. Whereas the District Court and Court of Appeals resolved this case entirely on the ground that Milford's actions did not offend the First Amendment's Speech Clause, the majority now sees fit to rule on the application of the Establishment Clause, in derogation of this Court's proper role as a court of review. E.g., National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/Ba2/national-collegiate-athletic-assn-v-smith/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;525&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;459&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 470 (1999) ("[W]e do not decide in the first instance issues not decided below").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p84"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;84&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Court's usual insistence on resisting temptations to convert itself into a trial court and on remaining a court of review is not any mere procedural nicety, and my objection to turning us into a district court here does not hinge on a preference for immutable procedural rules. Respect for our role as a reviewing court rests, rather, on recognizing that this Court can often learn a good deal from considering how a district court and a court of appeals have worked their way through a difficult issue. It rests on recognizing that an issue as first conceived may come to be seen differently as a case moves through trial and appeal; we are most likely to contribute something of value if we act with the benefit of whatever refinement may come in the course of litigation. And our customary refusal to become a trial court reflects the simple fact that this Court cannot develop a record as well as a trial court can. If I were a trial judge, for example, I would balk at deciding on summary judgment whether an Establishment Clause violation would occur here without having statements of undisputed facts or uncontradicted affidavits showing, for example, whether Good News conducts its instruction at the same time as school-sponsored extracurricular and athletic activities conducted by school staff and volunteers, see Brief for Respondent 6; whether any other community groups use school facilities immediately after classes end and how many students participate in those groups; and the extent to which Good News, with 28 students in its membership, may "dominate the forum" in a way that heightens the perception of official endorsement, Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B4V/rosenberger-v-rector-and-visitors-of-univ-of-va/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;515&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;819&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 851 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurring); see also Widmar v. Vincent, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ySF/widmar-v-vincent/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;454&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;263&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 274 (1981). We will never know these facts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p85"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;85&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Of course, I am in no better position than the majority to perform an Establishment Clause analysis in the first instance. Like the majority, I lack the benefit that development in the District Court and Court of Appeals might provide, and like the majority I cannot say for sure how complete the record may be. I can, however, speak to the doubtful underpinnings of the majority's conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p86"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;86&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This Court has accepted the independent obligation to obey the Establishment Clause as sufficiently compelling to satisfy strict scrutiny under the First Amendment. See id., at 271 ("[T]he interest of the [government] in complying with its constitutional obligations may be characterized as compelling"); Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S., at 394. Milford's actions would offend the Establishment Clause if they carried the message of endorsing religion under the circumstances, as viewed by a reasonable observer. See Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B4U/capitol-squarereview-and-advisory-bd-v-pinette/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;515&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;753&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 777 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurring). The majority concludes that such an endorsement effect is out of the question in Milford's case, because the context here is "materially indistinguishable" from the facts in Lamb's Chapel and Widmar. Ante, at 13. In fact, the majority is in no position to say that, for the principal grounds on which we based our Establishment Clause holdings in those cases are clearly absent here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p87"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;87&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In Widmar, we held that the Establishment Clause did not bar a religious student group from using a public university's meeting space for worship as well as discussion. As for the reasonable observers who might perceive government endorsement of religion, we pointed out that the forum was used by university students, who "are, of course, young adults," and, as such, "are less impressionable than younger students and should be able to appreciate that the University's policy is one of neutrality toward religion." 454 U.S., at 274, n. 14. To the same effect, we remarked that the "large number of groups meeting on campus" negated "any reasonable inference of University support from the mere fact of a campus meeting place." Ibid. Not only was the forum "available to a broad class of nonreligious as well as religious speakers," but there were, in fact, over 100 recognized student groups at the University, and an "absence of empirical evidence that religious groups [would] dominate [the University's] open forum." Id., at 274-275; see also id., at 274 ("The provision of benefits to so broad a spectrum of groups is an important index of secular effect"). And if all that had not been enough to show that the university-student use would probably create no impression of religious endorsement, we pointed out that the university in that case had issued a student handbook with the explicit disclaimer that "the University's name will not 'be identified in any way with the aims, policies, programs, products, or opinions of any organization or its members.' " Id., at 274, n. 14.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Lamb's Chapel involved an evening film series on child-rearing open to the general public (and, given the subject matter, directed at an adult audience). See 508 U.S., at 387, 395. There, school property "had repeatedly been used by a wide variety of private organizations," and we could say with some assurance that "[u]nder these circumstances ... there would have been no realistic danger that the community would think that the District was endorsing religion or any particular creed ... ." Id., at 395.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;89&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What we know about this case looks very little like Widmar or Lamb's Chapel. The cohort addressed by Good News is not university students with relative maturity, or even high school pupils, but elementary school children as young as six.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4-1" id="fn4-1_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; The Establishment Clause cases have consistently recognized the particular impressionability of schoolchildren, see Edwards v. Aguillard, &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;482&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;578&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 583-584 (1987), and the special protection required for those in the elementary grades in the school forum, see County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zoK/allegheny-county-v-greater-pittsburgh-aclu/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;492&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;573&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 620, n. 69 (1989). We have held the difference between college students and grade school pupils to be a "distinction [that] warrants a difference in constitutional results," Edwards v. Aguillard, supra, at 584, n. 5 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Nor is Milford's limited forum anything like the sites for wide-ranging intellectual exchange that were home to the challenged activities in Widmar and Lamb's Chapel. See also Rosenberger, 515 U.S., at 850, 836-837. In Widmar, the nature of the university campus and the sheer number of activities offered precluded the reasonable college observer from seeing government endorsement in any one of them, and so did the time and variety of community use in the Lamb's Chapel case. See also Rosenberger, 515 U.S., at 850 ("Given this wide array of nonreligious, antireligious and competing religious viewpoints in the forum supported by the University, any perception that the University endorses one particular viewpoint would be illogical"); id., at 836-837, 850 (emphasizing the array of university-funded magazines containing "widely divergent viewpoints" and the fact that believers in Christian evangelism competed on equal footing in the University forum with aficionados of "Plato, Spinoza, and Descartes," as well as "Karl Marx, Bertrand Russell, and Jean-Paul Sartre"); Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/zqP/board-of-ed-of-westside-community-schools-dist-66-/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;496&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;226&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 252 (1990) (plurality opinion) ("To the extent that a religious club is merely one of many different student-initiated voluntary clubs, students should perceive no message of government endorsement of religion").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p91"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;91&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The timing and format of Good News's gatherings, on the other hand, may well affirmatively suggest the imprimatur of officialdom in the minds of the young children. The club is open solely to elementary students (not the entire community, as in Lamb's Chapel), only four outside groups have been identified as meeting in the school, and Good News is, seemingly, the only one whose instruction follows immediately on the conclusion of the official school day. See Brief for National School Boards Association et al. as Amici Curiae 6. Although school is out at 2:56 p.m., Good News apparently requested use of the school beginning at 2:30 on Tuesdays "during the school year," so that instruction could begin promptly at 3:00, see Lodging, Exh. W-1, at which time children who are compelled by law to attend school surely remain in the building. Good News's religious meeting follows regular school activities so closely that the Good News instructor must wait to begin until "the room is clear," and "people are out of the room," App. P29, before starting proceedings in the classroom located next to the regular third- and fourth-grade rooms, id., at N12. In fact, the temporal and physical continuity of Good News's meetings with the regular school routine seems to be the whole point of using the school. When meetings were held in a community church, 8 or 10 children attended; after the school became the site, the number went up three-fold. Id., at P12; Lodging, Exh. AA2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p92"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;92&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Even on the summary judgment record, then, a record lacking whatever supplementation the trial process might have led to, and devoid of such insight as the trial and appellate judges might have contributed in addressing the Establishment Clause, we can say this: there is a good case that Good News's exercises blur the line between public classroom instruction and private religious indoctrination, leaving a reasonable elementary school pupil unable to appreciate that the former instruction is the business of the school while the latter evangelism is not. Thus, the facts we know (or think we know) point away from the majority's conclusion, and while the consolation may be that nothing really gets resolved when the judicial process is so truncated, that is not much to recommend today's result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1-3_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The Court of Appeals held that any challenge to the policy's reasonableness was foreclosed by its own precedent, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca2/4W9w/the-good-news-club-andrea-fournier-and-darleen-fou/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;202&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;502&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 509 (CA2 2000), a holding the majority leaves untouched, see ante, at 7 ("[W]e need not decide whether it is unreasonable in light of the purposes served by the forum"); cf. ante, at 7, n. 2 ("Because we hold that the exclusion of the Club on the basis of its religious perspective constitutes unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination, it is no defense for Milford that purely religious purposes can be excluded under state law"). In any event, the reasonableness of the forum limitation was beyond the scope of the appeal from summary judgment since the District Court had said explicitly that the religious use limitation was not challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn2-3"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2-3_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; It is true, as the majority notes, ante, at 8, n. 3, that the Court of Appeals did not cite Lamb's Chapel by name. But it followed it in substance, and it did cite an earlier opinion written by the author of the panel opinion here, Bronx Household of Faith v. Community School Dist. No. 10, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca2/4Q6X/the-bronx-household-of-faith-jack-roberts-robert-h/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;127&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;207&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CA2 1997), which discussed Lamb's Chapel at length.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn3-3"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3-3_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The majority rejects Milford's contention that Good News's activities fall outside the purview of the limited forum because they constitute "religious worship" on the ground that the Court of Appeals made no such determination regarding the character of the club's program, see ante, at 11, n. 4. This distinction is merely semantic, in light of the Court of Appeals's conclusion that "[i]t is difficult to see how the Club's activities differ materially from the 'religious worship' described" in other case law, 202 F.3d, at 510, and the record below. Justice Stevens distinguishes between proselytizing and worship, ante, at 1 (dissenting opinion), and distinguishes each from discussion reflecting a religious point of view. I agree with Justice Stevens that Good News's activities may be characterized as proselytizing and therefore as outside the purpose of Milford's limited forum, ante, at 5. Like the Court of Appeals, I also believe Good News's meetings have elements of worship that put the club's activities further afield of Milford's limited forum policy, the legitimacy of which was unchallenged in the summary judgment proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn4-1"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4-1_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; It is certainly correct that parents are required to give permission for their children to attend Good News's classes, see ante, at 14, (as parents are often required to do for a host of official school extracurricular activities), and correct that those parents would likely not be confused as to the sponsorship of Good News's classes. But the proper focus of concern in assessing effects includes the elementary school pupils who are invited to meetings, Lodging, Exh. X2, who see peers heading into classrooms for religious instruction as other classes end, and who are addressed by the "challenge" and "invitation."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p93"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;93&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The fact that there may be no evidence in the record that individual students were confused during the time the Good News Club met on school premises pursuant to the District Court's preliminary injunction is immaterial, cf. Brief for Petitioners 38. As Justice O'Connor explained in Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/B4U/capitol-squarereview-and-advisory-bd-v-pinette/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;515&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;753&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1995), the endorsement test does not focus "on the actual perception of individual observers, who naturally have differing degrees of knowledge," but on "the perspective of a hypothetical observer." Id., at 779-780 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).&lt;/p&gt;
